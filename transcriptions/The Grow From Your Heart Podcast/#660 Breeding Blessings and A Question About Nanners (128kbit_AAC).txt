[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and this is episode 660 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to answer a
couple of grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to those grow questions,
let's do a few shout outs to a few of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind folks who support the show on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with the big Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap it all up with the big Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thank you shout out to my friend
Chicago Dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it super easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been watching the past couple of
episodes, you know, this is the part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show where I invite you to join us on
the discord channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an iry army discord where all of
the iry genetics crew, the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast crew are hanging out on the
discord right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a live chat happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's posting pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave's doing an auction or a raffle or
something of that nature up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us on the discord channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a link in the show notes and in
the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to start the show by saying that
a few of my friends have mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I think is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have decided that when you overflow the
reservoir at a new grow, you have simply
[SPEAKER_00]: baptized the place with your new presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is now your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I licked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mine or I peed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what happens when you overflow the
reservoir at a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your new place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to figure out an excuse for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third time set a fucking timer and
quit taking so many dabs on your break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first time you overflowed that
reservoir, welcome to your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a christening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a rite of passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time it's a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time, but the third time it
gets embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give a shout out to a friend
who overflowed his reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get your name said,
but bro, big shout out, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overflow gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people might not be aware,
but I am not only the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do they know me as Rasta Jeff,
but also I am the head breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only breeder, the founder,
sole proprietor of iReGenetics premium
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a nice test crew that helps me
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some friends helping me with the
project this summer, but 99.99% of
[SPEAKER_00]: iReGenetics is all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a web guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the web guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the testing crew,
but the breeding, the selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that stuff happens by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do offer a product called table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not available on a website or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get seeds through some avenues,
through some auctions or some raffles or
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps a waffle, they do offer table
seeds as a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a moment to describe what
table seeds are before we get into this
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Table seeds are just exactly what they
sound like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say hypothetically, I was sitting at
this table and I was packing up a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed packages and I put a package of
whatever seeds into a bowl and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: disperse those seeds from a bowl into 10
packs or into 5 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I'm done, as I'm cleaning
up, I discover seeds on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what those get labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are now what are known as table
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unknown soldiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've worked with a couple of strains
over the course of the day and we clean up
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day, I may find 10 or 12
seeds and I don't know which bag they came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not give them a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just assign them a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just pick a bag for them to go
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just fake it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually set them aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into a another bowl that is
labeled table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just all the random seeds I clean up off
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I found it tucked under the side of
the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it rolled off that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I just don't know which bag it came
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to fake it, like I said
earlier, I don't lie to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't cheat you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't rip you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets assigned the word table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you buy seeds at a waffle or an
action, yes, we do be careful with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the words we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just jokes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do buy stuff in a waffle or an
action, I do send you extra table seeds as
[SPEAKER_00]: a bonus as a thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my way of giving you more
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do get bonus packs every time you shop
with me, but I will send you extra table
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if I've got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're low right now, so I stopped doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they pile back up and I've got more
to make it worth our time and energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put the table seeds back in the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you know what table seeds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the beauty about table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how magical table seeds
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be anything in my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything I've ever released.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything I've never released.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be stuff you've heard of a
thousand times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be shit you have never heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything, any seed that has ever crossed
this table has the potential to end up as
[SPEAKER_00]: a table seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I drop, if I've got a Congo to arise or
Jack the Ripper to, let's not say too many
[SPEAKER_00]: things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper to lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I dropped one of those seeds and it
rolled off somewhere and I found it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the table seed mix and I don't
even know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, I read genetics bag seed is
close to what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's from me, but you don't know
if it, which male or female was involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in that mix in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be anything from my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a feminized cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a King Solomon cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a Jack the Ripper cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be an old daybreaker cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a King Kim grape stomper
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything out of my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I made enough stress on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question stems from the table
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend grow can
advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like this one came over Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think big, big thank you for the
Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't thank you enough for the wisdom
you impart to the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: through your videos and podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those compliments, those words of
encouragement mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says we are, we are a better community
because of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I'm making a better
community, but if you say so, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to politely take the compliment,
but I don't know that I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I did make the whole community
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really cool chill vibe in the
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go hang out and go see the community we
did create.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit fighting with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says here is my question as a Patreon
supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to hang out on the discord
channel and learn from all of the fine
[SPEAKER_00]: folks in the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've even had the chance to win one of
the seed auctions a few months back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some seed auctions over on
the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to be careful what we say on
YouTube, but allegedly that could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm currently growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics, blue raspberry truffle,
and in the package I got a handful of 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 15 or 20 table seeds, which is funny
because they come in packs of 10 and you
[SPEAKER_00]: got 15 or 20, which means I was generous
with your table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to give you extra shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you guys choose to spend your
hard earned money, especially during the
[SPEAKER_00]: past year and a half, two years we've had
when we're not absolutely sure where the
[SPEAKER_00]: next nickel and dime could come from money
is extra expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you chose to spend your hard
earned money, your scarce money with my
[SPEAKER_00]: company on my brand, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make sure to show you that I love
you, that I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are thousands of other
breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of other breeders on
the same website where you buy my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking the, uh, the just buying my
brand and supporting my brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make sure you get more than
what you paid for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's if you get what you paid for,
you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get what you paid for,
you feel kind of angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get extra, you're like,
damn, I'm going to go back there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to show you that I'm
appreciative for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I dunno, I've, I've been given a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about spirituality and stuff,
but, uh, I'm, I'm rich spiritually and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm ready to give you more when
you spend your money with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: with me, that's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you feel the customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got 15 or 20 table seeds in your 10
pack is where that ramble stemmed from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, here is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the table seeds are unknown strains,
but otherwise good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to run all of them at once and
do a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I got to thinking, is there
anything wrong or unethical about breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm personally not in it to make a
bunch of seeds and sell them as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you feel if somebody took your
table seeds and kept the genetics going by
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even finding something pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you'll find something pretty fucking
cool in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what's the right thing to do with
naming anything that comes out of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see this from both sides as a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want my name on stuff that I
couldn't control the outcomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on the flip side, if it comes from
stock that I've put my heart and soul
[SPEAKER_00]: into, I'd want to make sure it's legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you tell me to fuck off,
bro, I would never tell anybody to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is, I've got full respect,
no matter what your ideas, I'll sit down
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always approach me with a smile and be
ready for a friendly, uh, conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll smoke a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we got to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find a resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is friendly that we can both agree
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never going to tell you to fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter who you are out there,
unless you need to fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says, I just want to grow this shit
and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good with, Oh, if you want me to tell
me to fuck off and just grow the shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all you do much love from
Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: No grow can advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me the opportunity to talk about
a couple things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is asking if they can breed
with the table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question is, can I breed with
your seeds is basically what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I encourage support, promote,
uh, endorse you breeding with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I made the seeds and you acquired them
through a reasonable, uh, ethical,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, moral method, if you didn't steal
them, uh, rip somebody off or lie to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them, I encourage you to breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you paid money for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's got money for them,
either myself or the vendor that sold them
[SPEAKER_00]: to you or the bro that sold them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody made some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they left my hands, I have no say,
so no control, uh, no real, I care that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a successful outcome,
but other than that, I can't really care
[SPEAKER_00]: too much about what you do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stay attached to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once I accepted money, they're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make rules on shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People paid me money for, uh, that's when
you tell me to fuck off when I take your
[SPEAKER_00]: money and give you rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's how that should go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I endorse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do breed with the seeds that you
get from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got from other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred with seeds and clones that came
from other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I did not invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just meditate one day and
manifest a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to start with seeds or clones that
came from another grower, another
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener, which was another breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't invent seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel no way territorial or,
uh, protective of the plant or of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel protective of the plant,
but not of the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to play freely just
like I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are seeds, there are grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got my blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I didn't invent this plant,
so I can't stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll make better shit than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be really delighted and proud to
see you use one of my packs of seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: make something better than anything I've
ever done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as a teacher, as a breeder,
I'm not going to be around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect to fucking live forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need people to be a good grower,
better breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to pass this torch eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there were breeders that taught me how
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to teach you the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I hope to teach you good ethics and
good morals within breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can use my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got my full permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that, it would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a special case because these
are table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use any of my seeds that you know
what they are, just say that was
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst cross to whatever you
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put, give credit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lie and say that's secret strain a
to secret strain B.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the community doesn't trust
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But second of all, that's a dick move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice my packages of seeds,
it always says this crossed to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know that that was sub
cools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the ripper crossed to my arise or
however it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crockett's, uh, strawberry fields to my
daybreaker or whatever I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not lying to anybody, misleading
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are also I'm giving credit to
the people who I'm using their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also medical smokers are looking for
relief and they know certain strains help
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they see that maybe OG Kush is
something that works great for a person
[SPEAKER_00]: and then strawberry something,
if it's got strawberry in it, maybe it
[SPEAKER_00]: works really good for a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can look through the genetic
history and see this has OG Kush and
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry on one side and OG Kush and the
Terps on the other side, it may,
[SPEAKER_00]: they know how to map out their medicine a
little bit that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives them a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives them a clue at what to select for
their medical consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important for several
reasons that we label these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, correctly with the crosses and
honor the original breeders that made
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that anything you learn,
it's very important to honor the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't fucking wizards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us learned from Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll hear me say a lot of times
things like I learned that from Mr. Soul
[SPEAKER_00]: or I read this in Soma's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's important to teach those
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you guys have the opportunity as
well to say, Oh, we learned it from Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go research Mr. Soul and then you
find out Mr. Soul got more, you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm learning and then you get a
deeper understanding and then we can learn
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do feel that it is okay to breed with
my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't invent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ethics would be to put, normally you
would just put the strain name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are table seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to put,
I read, just put table seeds by I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I always write a nice story about
my strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would just say I acquired some table
seeds from my buddy, I read genetics or
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff at I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a keeper in there with these
traits and describe the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just maybe I can identify what
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to a hundred percent say
that I can, but once it's in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe through visual descriptions,
through some aroma descriptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can identify what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very familiar with my lineup,
but you can honor it by saying it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: table seed from Rasta Jeff from I read
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed it to this and this is what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then the really cool thing to do
would be send me a 10 pack, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have space to grow it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you find something fire
and you breed it and you send it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: me and then I grow that and I breed it to
something, I promise you, I send seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how that, that works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do keep my friends in mind when I'm
working with the stuff they send me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's the right thing to do with
naming anything that comes out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Name it whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got my blessing, my honor,
name it something that is cool to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, uh, if you want to honor my line,
and my work, you can put something in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that would sort of give a hint of
where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could give a pay homage to it through
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of try to do that with some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, blueberry butcher is Jack the
ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got Jack the ripper in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the word butcher ended up in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sounds like blueberry killing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the ripper and it's got blueberry
cookies on one side, uh, blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I honored the Jack the ripper in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a rise got called a rise because it
has got daybreaker as the male and
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker comes from gauge green
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they name a lot of their stuff,
one word, like uplifting positive words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kept with the theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't steal a word they were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rise was actually submitted by a social
media fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said a rise would be a cool strain
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm going to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pays tribute to the original breeder
that bred one of the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It honors that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues that tradition, but it's also
my own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the name arise came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you ever knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honor me maybe by putting something
with my, or just name it something,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're into transformers,
name it after a fucking transformer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into electronic stuff,
name it after some electronic shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, your grow can advocate, do name it
something after your cannabis activism or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with the name creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to name it whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of the beauty of naming
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to have fun with my naming
schemes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I drive myself crazy because
I've got the perfect name for a strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I still insist that it isn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like you're trying to
make seeds for market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the name won't be as critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like a name, the name of
a strain can dictate the success or
[SPEAKER_00]: failure of that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's got a bad name, it just won't
sell for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes things on the market don't
have the, they're not the best product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've got a good name and they just
sell because of the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always struggle with the perfect
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to crowd source names a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, see what people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to come up with my own stuff,
but then let the crowd kind of weigh in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit because they're the ones buying
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But come up with a name that means
something to you, something that you smile
[SPEAKER_00]: or you grin or you giggle, or you feel
some sort of pride every time you say that
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, if you're not going to put
it out to market, it doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: something catchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to catch the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can name it whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So name the strain, whatever feels good to
you, whatever is fun to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe if you got a family or something
or somebody helping you grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they've got a name suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you guys can compile your names,
combine your names together, come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like making up a band name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is always fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered the basics of your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the, uh, the blessing to breed
with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just put that it's an irie genetics
table seat in there or an irie genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: however you want to label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, if you're not going to sell
it or do anything with it, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to really worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, but, uh, it's just an irie
genetics table seed crossed to whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you choose to cross it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, name it whatever you want,
have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you want some strain name ideas,
let me know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's try to identify this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to send pictures on
Canaba or on Patreon yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it doesn't let me attach pictures,
but send them to me through my email grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe as it's early in flower later in
flower, I may be able to help you identify
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, uh, I can hear some descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the aromas and we'll see what you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to tell by how long it takes
to flower the leaf shape, the colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: some aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be able to at least narrow down
some options of what you may have in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow can advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rambled for a long time about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope I answered your question,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out there have fun breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, even if you've got a seed company,
breed with some of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, uh, don't just straight take a male
and start a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, take a male, take a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed something, select a male from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your own male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make a seed company out of that would
be cool, but you've got my blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored that you choose to work with
my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some good breeding stock in there,
so don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I do have more messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have time for another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a long episode, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you guys a long one this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want their name said their name is
not listed, so we're going to skip that
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep them anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Jeff, I love this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked a question during the premiere and
you asked me to email it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching the premiere on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show does premiere on, on YouTube at
12 o'clock mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's midnight, uh, mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going from Wednesday to Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, um, it's technically 11 59
Wednesday into 12 Thursday at midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, mountain time is when these shows come
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the premiere on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do Wednesday and Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be Wednesday and Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Sunday into Monday and Wednesday into
Thursday is when the premieres come out at
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out quite often in the premiere in
the chat with my friends and I watched the
[SPEAKER_00]: chat and I talk with the guys and gals
that are there and we bullshit a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit during that chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend did ask us this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way for me to remember it or
capture it there in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, please email it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, could you do a segment or an
episode on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I have to be careful with the
words I use because I mentioned this
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have a friend whose channel got
flagged because they used an inappropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: word, which was really funny because
they're using it appropriately,
[SPEAKER_00]: but algorithms will get you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, can we talk about intersex plants and
finding Nanner's on plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't the words on the paper here,
but I'm trying to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you know how long until Nanner's
develop pollen or can you explain if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a difference on when Nanner show
up during week three or when they show up
[SPEAKER_00]: on week five, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you keep them or do you chop based on
these circumstances?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you're working with some of the
new common varietals out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is not uncommon to discover intersex
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a plant that appears to be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point in that plant's
life, it throws out male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that plant throws out male flowers,
you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this question is all
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we handle these plants that
suddenly tell us that they are intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we had female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of OG Kush and chem stuff will
have a tendency to throw some Nanner's on
[SPEAKER_00]: you because that comes from somewhere down
the line and the chems and the OG Kush's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is an intersex gene that trait is in
there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've done a lot of breeding with them
to try to wash that out and remove it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is always going to be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it can happen from a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, temperature swings early, late in veg,
early in flower temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature swings, temperature stress too
high or too low of one way or the other
[SPEAKER_00]: can definitely, uh, what's the word
influence, uh, intersects traits in our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, uh, stress of any sort early in
flower or late in flower can trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overfeeding, uh, certain things can cause
intersex traits to appear within our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, light problems, light leaks,
light interruptions can cause intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits within our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me interrupt myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying can cause intersex traits
within our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These traits are already in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say this plant turned intersex on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say, no, it was always intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gave it the opportunity to show
you, um, that plant was always an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gave it the option to show you it
was an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always had that intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just never gave it the environment to
express that phenotypical expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple is a trait just like trichomes are
a trait, just like aroma is a trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, just like the buzz is a trait of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait that is carried within
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you breed to that plant, it will move
that trait along the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chances of getting it depend on just
the genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this male wash that out with this
female or does this female carry that
[SPEAKER_00]: trait?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we breed it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you miss it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even mess with it honestly,
as a, as a breeder with so many options
[SPEAKER_00]: and opportunities for plants, I don't mess
with anything that gives me too much or
[SPEAKER_00]: much intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mess with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have chosen to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, the, the trait is already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening is we are triggering
that trait to express itself in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes the plants will show you they
have intersex traits early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go right into flower and then
you'll see female parts and then you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see male parts like 15 days in that is an
early expressing intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would remove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to keep that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an early intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be a struggle for nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire grow and the prob, the main
problem is that male part and the female
[SPEAKER_00]: part are timed up perfectly to where if
pollen does come out, the females are
[SPEAKER_00]: timed perfectly to receive the pollen and
there's no way to keep that plant from
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating itself and the plants around
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that early intersex sign, I would not
even fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one goes bye bye quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, no need for a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that problematic plant the fuck out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replace it with something good or use that
space for one of the plants that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grow a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's talk about a week three intersex
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's about, that's about where we
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about day 15, uh, day 17,
day 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing those early intersex
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As things go into flower, get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to keep that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got replacement plants,
better seeds, other opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of that intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's no need to have intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that in the garden with all the
options for good seeds, good plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why fuck with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's like going on a first date and
finding out that you're totally not
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible and still trying to stick it
out for nine fucking weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do that to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call that fucking intersex plant move
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about like week five or week
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm seeing intersex pop up around week
five or week six, I've got a decision to
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this plant hot fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something I've grown before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this my first run with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's my first run and I'm seeing
intersex a week, five or six, this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: better have other traits that make it
highly desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it throwing one or two Nanners?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may keep her around.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's throws four or five, five or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to keep an eye on those Nanners and
see if they develop into, if they start
[SPEAKER_00]: making what looks like could open into a
sack, I have to watch how big it's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I pluck that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I cut them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I cut those nugs off the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I cut the plant down entirely?
[SPEAKER_00]: That depends on other traits of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the shape of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the leaf size?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like overall other than
those couple of Nanners in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are enough there, five,
six, seven, I'm gonna get worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be able to sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I close my eyes, I'm gonna go,
my crops getting seeded by an intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that I'm too stubborn to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna have to wake up and fucking
get rid of it if it's got like nine
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got two or three, we may keep an
eye on it and see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna watch those Nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may never do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be filled with pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my job to keep an eye on it and see
what they do and make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're gonna fill with pollen and
cause me a problem, I'm gonna get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those are sterile Nanners, let it grow,
let it grow, let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to cut down sterile
Nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a slight hermit trait within that
plant, maybe not breedable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if certain things are triggering those
Nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they just pop up regularly,
I've worked with a couple of plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: like at week eight, it'll just pop a
couple of Nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move right into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in flower popping Nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week eight, week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not concerned really because my plants
are nine weeks into flower, eight weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistils on the plants, the parts that
would receive the pollen are withered and
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna get any pollen at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not pollinate my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if we're getting Nanners
around week eight or week nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't worry too much because those
plants are too far into their life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: to become pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I am concerned with is if I'm
running a perpetual grow, which I often
[SPEAKER_00]: do, which would mean that I've got plants
coming in as plants are going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may have some plants right at peak
pollination time while these plants at
[SPEAKER_00]: week eight or week nine possibly are
producing Nanners which may contain
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got a couple things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we pick out those Nanners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we chop off the buds with the Nanners?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those Nanners going to produce pollen
or are they sterile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, in my experience,
a plant that expresses an intersex trait
[SPEAKER_00]: around week eight or week nine generally
produces sterile flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have any pollen in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not create any pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is most of my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen the opposite, but probably 90%
of the time those late flower intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: male flowers are not threatening to my
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, let's talk about a previous
episode, those are the plant trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a way to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those plants may pollinate,
but most of the time those Nanners that
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up late do not contain any pollen,
so they usually do not stress me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if there are one or two,
two or three, once we get up to five or
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, again, I start going, what is with
that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at week eight or week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let it finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may grow it one more time and maybe not
push it so hard at the end or maybe push
[SPEAKER_00]: it harder at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I push the plants pretty fucking
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably what caused it to show me
intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the next grow, I would simply
reduce my feed, be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: careful with my light cycle, pay a little
bit more attention, and see if I can make
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant not show me intersex traits on
the second run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does it again, I've got a decision
to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I gonna get rid of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth keeping it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a late flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing that in late flower because it
wants to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing what we were calling the
Jurassic Park effect in a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have the will to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life does find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why they're showing you
intersex in week nine or week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some later flowering plants will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a 10 or 11, 12 week flowering
plant, it may do it in the last two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: right before harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally, in the environment,
that plant would have been destroyed by
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: A goat would have eaten it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something, the wind would have taken it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature would have knocked it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind, the weather, the rain,
something would have knocked it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never would have gotten that far in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it did, it would have said,
I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't I get pollinated yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I've spoken about before,
these plants main goal is to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to survive so there can be more
plants for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't give them the opportunity
to mate, they'll find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant just goes, hey,
you didn't pollinate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting all of my energy into
making babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never gave me that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something in these plants that
says I can make my own male parts and just
[SPEAKER_00]: start spitting out flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have selected, hopefully through
breeding, through selective breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: through several generations, hopefully we
have removed most of those intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, but it is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not removed from the cannabis gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: By any means, it's all about selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went on a really good ramble there,
but early showing intersex plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go mid flower like week five or week
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some things to think about late
flowering plants that show intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're fire, keep them around,
let them have a couple of nanners at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do pollinate, use those seeds,
grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some really cool bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't share them with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make any money off of them,
but grow them because you may have some
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant was cool enough to keep
around until week nine or week 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it made some intersex flowers,
it's probably good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe whatever you accidentally bred that
to is going to be better or equally good
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke with different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, it's a fun project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some free bag seeds to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, you're new at
germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some seeds you could try to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practice seeds are never a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me make sure I answered the
majority of your question here because I
[SPEAKER_00]: do feel like I got rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do an episode or segment on nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the word intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to avoid the H word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely don't like the shortened
version of the H word.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just sounds childish to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say it H and then E at the end of
it, H-E, that just sounds like a child,
[SPEAKER_00]: third grade word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say just Herman or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do it, say short for
Herman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say hermene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to end up with a YouTube
fucking strike here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex is the word we want to use,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex is the appropriate word for what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a show on intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three, cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week five or six, you've got decisions to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late flowering, late showing intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably sterile, probably not too
big of a deal unless maybe you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual and maybe that's not a sterile
male flower popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, intersex is from,
it is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in there and then it just expressed
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a trait that was always in the
plant waiting to show you had to trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: it, give it the right environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that is just from breeding
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to choose better plants,
stress test the plants before you breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with them, test the progeny before you
sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my short ramble on intersex
plants, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered a lot of ground in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody again for
listening to episode 660 of the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast.

show, it puts a big smile on my face and
[SPEAKER_00]: it blows my mind every time.

along for the entire journey.

you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe it to you to make the show better.

editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to make it a great show before you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to keep the quality content going.

episode.

I'll see you in the next one.
Bye.
