[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 431 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can still hear my last dab in
my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was highly effective and it was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a dab of Miracle Alien
Cookies, full spectrum extract from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is the MAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate is delicious and it got
me high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, it says this is a blend of
alien cookies and Colombian Starfighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as jelly biscuits
and lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I tasted jelly biscuits,
but I absolutely did taste and smell the
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says that
this product contains 73.8% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've honestly been smoking another
concentrate that says it contains 98%
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Miracle Alien Cookies,
full spectrum extract immediately put me
[SPEAKER_00]: in another place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me somewhere beyond where that 98%
concentrate has been putting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't fall for the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely too much on the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab testing is great, but it should not be
the main deciding factor when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one concentrate in my hand that
says it contains 98% total cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I've also got this Miracle Alien
Cookies, which says it has 73.8% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather dab this 73.8% concentrate
over this 98% concentrate almost any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it tastes better and I think the
buzz is more desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells me that it's not all about
the THC, that it is a lot to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: other compounds that are in there,
the terpenes, the flavonoids, whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: else is in this product, that other,
let's see, we've got 74% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then approximately that other 26% of
stuff is actually making me enjoy the buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out once again to our friends
at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous Miracle Alien Cookies,
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit has me high as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, in this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to read a couple of emails from
some listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those emails will segue us into doing a
couple of strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a couple of
shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to my friend Farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: John.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to David O'Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wanna send a big Grow From Your
Heart podcast fist bump to my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but certainly not least,
a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out and a fist bump to my buddy Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to become a
patron, you can do so by going to patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: .com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
at the start of the show, I said that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had a couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste any more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this first email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on the message, it says no names on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read this, so I know not to say
your name, let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, I've been listening for over a
year and I have bought seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only am I a podcaster, I am also a
seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may not know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the only breeder, the only proprietor
of iReGenetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this person has bought seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are available at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Hela Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seeds are also available at Oregon
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find my seeds at Green Go
Beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the very near future, I will be
announcing another vendor that I am very
[SPEAKER_00]: proud to be involved with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I think you would sell even more
seeds if you made more strain info
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shop heavily with Duke Diamond,
mainly because he has those growing tips
[SPEAKER_00]: on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on seeds here now listings,
he has great descriptions and grow notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I love the constructive criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of details on my
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: My packaging is very minimalistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of have one generic package,
then I put a sticker on it to identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my packaging, yes, does not contain a
lot of info.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my website has overly detailed
descriptions of every strain that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: available, plus stuff that I released a
long time ago and has since been
[SPEAKER_00]: discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on my website, you should be able to
find information on every strain
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put a lot of the older strains that
are discontinued up there also because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were used as parents and current
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see something like what's one
that I did a lot of work on, if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: something like Space Force, you say,
well, what the heck is Space Force?
[SPEAKER_00]: Space Force is Space Bitch crossed to
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may not know what Arise or Space
Bitch is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can click on Space Bitch and you
can see that Space Bitch is a space queen
[SPEAKER_00]: from Subcool pollinated by my reversed
grateful dog that made Space Bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can also see that Arise is Golden
Goat to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start breaking down the
family tree that way, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are buying seeds really want to
know really detailed lineage of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on my website, I do have overly
detailed descriptions, but I do appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: your recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the future, maybe I will be able to
add more descriptions to my packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on and it says,
I bought your lemon Jeffrey after
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to that strain review episode
because it is cool to hear the breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: give tips and a little of what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you appreciated and trusted
my review and I'm glad you got some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: by being inspired off of that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I hope they went crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you grew the shit out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they made you completely happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I understand that you don't like
to toot your own horn on the show by doing
[SPEAKER_00]: strain reviews for every offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I would get sick of a month of
strain reviews, but how about an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: or two where you give a shorter
presentation on each strain, perhaps a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick story, a few phenos to look for a
tip or two, and then take a dab of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a wonderful idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does feel a little bit weird sitting
here and talking about my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, the strains that I've created,
the strains that I've made available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels egotistical and it feels kind of
weird doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so many people ask for it that I do
feel like it is time to put out a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: strain episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in this episode, we are going to
jump into some strain descriptions pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this email and it goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit a bunch of strains, dished out a
ton of info on the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was with Scotty taking up time
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a couple of episodes would be
enough to really push your seed sales
[SPEAKER_00]: through the roof and help all those
customers get what they are really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to hear advice and guidance
from consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on this end of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on that end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate this sort of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the email and it says,
you are the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all of the info and the
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he ends it by signing his name
and he asked me not to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep your name private.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the encouragement and thank
you for the constructive criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't know where they can improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they're making mistakes until
sometimes somebody points that out to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know now that by doing a little better
strain descriptions on my packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: having a little bit better of a strain
description on the vendor websites that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I may sell a few more seed packages,
which would always be nice for myself as a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed seller and always nice for the people
on the other end who are getting seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take that to heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we are going to use some of your
advice on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into the next email
because it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm in prohibition land, so please
don't say my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say that your podcast has
helped me immensely in my growing efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work nine hours a day as a janitor,
basically sweeping floors and being bored
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your podcast helps so much to pass the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I'm glad I'm making your day go
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has got to get tedious just sweeping
floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm there to entertain you at
least one or two days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels like we've got a great relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already, he goes on to say, I love the
show lessons or I love the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also love the episodes with white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, white Mike, you got a shout out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to come do another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I just finished my
first grow and I was honestly feeling a
[SPEAKER_00]: little discouraged and I had thoughts of
giving up growing because I did not get
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield I had wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I heard you talk on one of the
grow lessons about how to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: discouraged by your first grow and to
instead use it as a learning opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that advice has started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can't give up on the first try of
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the first time you played Mario
Kart?
[SPEAKER_00]: You sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was no fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't keep that damn car on the
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't go around the corners right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody threw a banana at you and you
fucking spun out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now everybody kicks ass at Mario Kart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't expect to be really good at
anything the first time you try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a terrible drummer the first time I
got sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted to beat me to death with my
drumsticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can hold a fat groove all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel discouraged if you are not a
pro at something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect to be a pro at growing the
very first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a successful crop that you can
smoke out of your first grow, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like this guy says, use it as a
learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a baseline to start from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your next grow is worse, you should
reconsider shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your next grow is better, you were on
the path you need to be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't ever get discouraged from
anything you fail at the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a learning lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to fail the first time because if
you're successful, if you're huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're hugely successful at anything
the first time, it gets to your ego and
[SPEAKER_00]: you start teaching yourself bad habits
because you already know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue with this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am now on my second grow and
I'm growing Michelangelo from iReGenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: in a five gallon pot with Fox Farms Ocean
Forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using a horticultural lighting
group, 100 grow light with a two by two
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I live in a one room cabin
without much space, but I am feeling more
[SPEAKER_00]: confident about this grow thanks to the
help of your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, if you have any tips
for that strain, it would be awesome to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for the rambling email,
but I wanted to let you know that your
[SPEAKER_00]: show is amazing and tell you to keep up
the good work, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this is a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy started off disappointed in
his first grow, but listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast encouraged him to give it a second
try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm proud of you for going in for a
second try, even though the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of disappointed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time he has got a great setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some Michelangelo seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a platinum tangy pollinated by a
reversed blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got some feminized seeds that are
very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what they are going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be great in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a five gallon fabric pot with Fox
Farms Ocean Forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be great for this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's using the appropriate light.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got an HLG 100 and his two by two
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably got one five gallon pot
under this light in a two by two tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should provide perfect medicine for
one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he says, if you have any tips for the
Michelangelo, it would be awesome to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the point in the episode where
that first email talking about strain
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions and strain review episodes is
going to collide with this email where our
[SPEAKER_00]: new friend is asking for advice and
guidance on the strain Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's shift podcast gears and do a few
strain reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to start with the
Michelangelo today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with the strain that I
call Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leonardo is a very important strain to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leonardo was made from a reversed
blueberry cookies plant, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum cookies crossed to the blueberry
Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can already imagine the smells and
aromas coming from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the blueberry cookies plant and I
reversed it, which means I treated it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That solution made that plant produce
pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pollen sacks produced pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only contain female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done complete episodes on reversing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done full episodes on selfed and
reversed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more information on that,
check out episode number 331 called
[SPEAKER_00]: selfing and reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into deep detail there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to focus on these few
strains because I can tell that this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode is going to get quite long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the blueberry cookies and I
selfed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a blueberry cookies S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leonardo is the blueberry cookies S1 being
selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it doesn't have a lot of
opportunity for phenotypical variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find very common
phenotypes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry cookies will grow tall and fast
in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from the Tahoe OG parents and the
Girl Scout cookies parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes to get kind of tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will make long branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also makes giant colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the crosses that came from the
blueberry cookies really take off in
[SPEAKER_00]: height, but they make up for it because
they make gigantic top colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for taller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe flower just a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect your plants to double in size from
the time you flip them to the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blueberry cookies will get tall and
it makes tall offspring, but they make
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get heavy harvests from almost
all of the blueberry cookies crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every phenotype will give you big
fat harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Leonardo is going to get kind of tall
and make gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give Leonardo about eight and a
half to 10 weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between eight and a half to 10
weeks will be perfect for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between 60 and 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that comes from the Leonardo
crosses can be fed very heavily and they
[SPEAKER_00]: also like to drink a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that most of them love to
suck up more water than the average plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to feed them heavily
and you're going to have to water them
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of the crosses that come from the
Leonardo, the reversed blueberry cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are all huge producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all make tremendous resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to take somewhere
between eight and a half to 10 weeks to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that is really going to make
these crosses stand out is all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: unique flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used very carefully selected females for
these crosses and my goal was to make
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous candy turps and I feel like I
nailed that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the flavors and aromas
from the blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dominant smell of course is the
blueberry, but it also has a funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost like blue nerds or some sort
of blue candy, maybe blue Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of when I was
younger and I used to buy those blue
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry lollipops and I would suck on
those and it would turn my whole face
[SPEAKER_00]: blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of those kind of
suckers with a wang to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got something sharper, something
funky to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like blue nerds and Skittles with
dirty feet in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really enjoyable and I really love
that funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that smells it really loves that
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of what inspired me to work
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very well-known grower and breeder
smoked some of the finished product and
[SPEAKER_00]: when he smoked it, he said, man,
this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any seeds available?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, there aren't any seeds
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, can somebody reverse this and
make some seeds so that I could take this
[SPEAKER_00]: back to where I live and grow it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody kind of looked at me and it
became my job to reverse the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies and make seeds of it for this
friend of ours who is a highly respected
[SPEAKER_00]: member of the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to accept that job,
but when I do something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just make one cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to think about it and I chose a few
of my favorite females to put in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the blueberry cookies to
pollinate them also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I made very wise choices
on the girls that I selected, but let's
[SPEAKER_00]: keep focusing on the blueberry cookies for
a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still talking about the flavors
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like blueberries and it is like blue
skittles and the flavor just hangs out in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mouth for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have tremendous cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, I really need a drink,
but you won't want to drink anything
[SPEAKER_00]: because that cotton mouth flavor from the
blueberry cookies is just so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the crosses are going to be
dominated by that blueberry cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue raspberry funky turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind as we talk about all
of the next crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next cross I want to talk about that
was made from that reversed blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies is a strain I call Donatello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donatello was made by the reversed
blueberry cookies pollinating my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon skunk female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about that lemon skunk female a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the mother of the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is also the mother of firefly that
lemon skunk has made a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with her for several
years because I love that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts off beautiful colors, beautiful,
bright, bright, light green colors with
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful orange pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a gorgeous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon candy and sort of a lemon sorbet
sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smelled anything like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from seed, so I'm the only one
that has got that phenotype as far as I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love working with that lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it because of the aromas,
the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything about it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crossed it to the blueberry
cookies, it put a lemon lime blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a wang to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like a key lime pie with
blueberries in the middle or a blue
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry key lime kind of a pie sort of a
thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the aromas and flavors of
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donatello does grow tall because of that
lemon skunk, but it's got big thick fat
[SPEAKER_00]: branches so it can get tall and it can
handle being cracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can handle being bent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can handle being worked into a net.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes that sort of a stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think it should go about eight to
10 weeks for best results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to vary depending on your
environment, based on your humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: your temperature and your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things will determine the factor
of how long it takes for these plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somewhere between 60 and 70 days
should be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should note about the
Donatello, most of these strains I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about get quite tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donatello is one of the more branchy
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will widen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants a little bit more space than the
rest of its sisters in this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to spread its arms just a little
bit more and it does get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: branchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need to be prepared with
steaks, tomato cages or some sort of scrog
[SPEAKER_00]: net because she may need some training.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to try to widen out on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, she will need some supports later in
flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all of these strains love it when
you put them in a scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it when you crack them,
when you super crop them, when you twist
[SPEAKER_00]: them, when you pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like being topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these plants can take pretty good
abuse because of the parents I selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the strain that
inspired this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo is made from a platinum tangy
female that was of course pollinated by
[SPEAKER_00]: that blueberry cookies male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum tangy has its own crazy
unique aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like dirty, greasy oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like candied oranges that you got at
the motor oil shop or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious and funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to like those really fruity flavors
with something nasty on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems to be one of my favorite
sort of varieties to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something with a real familiar
citrusy fruit thing and then just dirty it
[SPEAKER_00]: up with some funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've noticed in most of the
Michelangelo seeds is that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: dominantly oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out as just sweet, gross oranges,
almost orange rinds, almost overpowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overpowering orange cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oranges sometimes have a overpowering
astringent aroma when you get too close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the rind and I think sometimes the
Michelangelo can carry that in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is overpoweringly orange and it is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make concentrates that
taste like straight up tangerines and
[SPEAKER_00]: oranges, Michelangelo is the way to go for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Stabby McStaberson grew some
Michelangelo that the jar still smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like oranges and tangerines and it's been
empty for over a month now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flavors for Michelangelo is
dominantly oranges with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: that skittly funk on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That candy funk sweetness which I really
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo is another one that will
branch out a little bit for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from that Platinum Tangy,
that one doesn't get super tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a short squat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the Michelangelo do kind of the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She stays a little shorter than the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, she will get tall on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll make big plants, but she is a
little branchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: She widens out a little bit more,
but she makes really thick stalks so she
[SPEAKER_00]: can support herself a little better than
the Donatello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, like all of these crosses,
Michelangelo will love being scrogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll love being trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll love being topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants can all take quite a bit of
abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should note, Michelangelo
may be the earliest finisher out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that some of them should
take 60 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikey may finish as early as 56 or 55
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be in a rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it finish if it wants to go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it, but some of the phenotypes coming
from that Platinum Tangy cross do make it
[SPEAKER_00]: finish a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk next about Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure by now you have found the trend
and the theme in these strains that I
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where these names came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael is the strawberry fields from
Crockett Farms pollinated by the reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strawberry fields plant is great to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes giant colas and that definitely
came through in the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael likes to make giant, huge top
colas that are just coated in trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: and they smell ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like strawberries and tangerines and
there's a little bit of a grapefruit thing
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get that blueberry skittles
that kind of backs it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really hard to describe because it
is just so funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tropical, it's strawberries,
it's mangoes, it's pineapples,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of all that tropical
fruit plus that weird funk that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost tastes like, in my opinion,
and people think I'm crazy sometimes with
[SPEAKER_00]: my strain descriptions, but a lot of
people love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when I smoke a dab,
my mouth gets really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when I smoke the Raphael,
my mouth gets juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like I just ate juicy candy or
juicy fruit and my mouth is actually moist
[SPEAKER_00]: from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not thirsty when I smoke the
Raphael concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I should add to that is
Raphael makes great concentrates and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a lot of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that presses it, that washes it,
that extracts it in any way, they always
[SPEAKER_00]: report back that they got impressive
returns and then later on they always
[SPEAKER_00]: report that it tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Raphael is great for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also great for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need something with fat harvests
and good bag appeal and unique aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael is perfect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two more strains I want to talk
about here in this strain review episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I want to talk about is
called Bebop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bebop is my prized Arise number four
female pollinated by the reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two of my best tasting
favorite to grow, favorite to smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: best lab testing, easiest to work with
strains and I crossed them and the results
[SPEAKER_00]: were almost exactly what I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turbocharged the good traits from both
of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically made bigger batter blueberry
cookies with more potency and more
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes and it seems to grow with more
vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bebop does tend to get a little bit tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it has got the Josepho G,
the Chem D, the Tahoe and the cookies all
[SPEAKER_00]: in there that is going to result in taller
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this is one of the longer finishing
crosses in this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that most of these plants
are going to take about eight to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really recommend that you let this one
go closer to 10 weeks if you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and that last week it's going
to add potency and it is going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: itself just another week to just bulk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll get even bigger and fatter on you
and it'll be well worth that extra week if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can let it go that full 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bebop does get kind of tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does take a little bit longer to
finish but she is ridiculously potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I crossed those, I knew that the
potency would be off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichome development on these plants
will be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavors and aromas are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of the blueberry cookies really
dominates the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that blue skittles, blueberry
cookies, blue raspberry sort of a flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: but then it's got a wonderful,
disgusting, skunky, OG kush thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back end of it that you don't notice until
you try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You inhale and it's straight up candy and
deliciousness and then you blow it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, oh, that is dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two different flavors in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the Bebop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing about her is that she is
the longest flowering one out of the line
[SPEAKER_00]: and she's going to get tall but she makes
up for it with amazing potency and
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the space, the height and
the patience, Bebop is a great one for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one in this line that we're going
to talk about is what is left,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one called Rocksteel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocksteel is a Durban poison female
pollinated by the reversed blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also a huge crowd pleaser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocksteel grows ridiculously fast and
makes ridiculously giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocksteel is going to get tall like the
rest of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will finish in that eight to 10 week
time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to think about with Rocksteel is
it does not like as much water as the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of these crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from that Durban poison female,
it wants a little bit less water than the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it likes to widen out real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get a real big top cola,
but then you'll get some branches that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to kind of stretch out and make some
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is going to need cages or supports or
she works wonderfully in a screen of green
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: She kind of programs herself automatically
to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is beautiful in a screen of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really weave her in there super
nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the flavors that come off of Rocksteel
are hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's got that blueberry cookie
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that blue raspberry thing going
on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you put that Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Durban poison has a hint of mint
in the background of the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody describes that other
flavor as anise oil, which I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever smelled real anise, but it's got
that Durban poison sort of a peppery sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a thing, sort of a mint thing going on
with that blueberry cookies thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also creates sort of a raspberry
kind of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know where the raspberry
comes from, but many of the phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: have a raspberry aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of that flavor is blackberries
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that sort of a tart thing that a
fresh berries got, but it also has that
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, it's really complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to describe other than
that blue raspberry flavor with that
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect Durban poison combination to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is exactly what you thought it would
taste like if you cross those two
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is enough on the breakdown
of Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael, Bebop and Rocksteady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to wrap it up, all of them are going
to grow fairly tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are going to bush out a
little bit more for you are the
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo and the Bebop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rocksteady is going to grow a little
more sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to exactly bush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It branches out and those branches need
supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like most of the Durban
poison crosses want to stay lower to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and bush out a little bit and then
produce one big top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we train them, if we give them some
supports, they really work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lift themselves up and they work
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that flavor and aroma and the
potency can't be beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep working with the
Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an excellent strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocksteady may need a little extra
attention out of all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're running a screen of green,
that is the ideal strain for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these strains are going to produce
crazy, ridiculous candy, out of control
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need some sort of odor
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to wrap it all up, most of them are
going to finish in about eight to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that is phenotype dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is environment dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be nutrient, light,
humidity, dependent, but most of them will
[SPEAKER_00]: take about 56 to 70 days to be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I didn't go too deep into specific
phenotypes to look for within each strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, honestly, it is going to
be about a 50-50 mix of each parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find things that look a
lot like the blueberry cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're going to find things that
look a lot like the female I crossed it
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll find things that kind of
dominate or are 50-50 mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find very close
representations to both parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful combinations in every strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a quick breakdown on six of my
favorite feminized lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more feminized seeds coming out
in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about one of those strains on
the show in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like more information about
any of those strains or if you'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: see photos, there are highly detailed
descriptions on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the genetics tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information on all of the
strains will be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that the website isn't the most
advanced piece of technology on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is
currently there, and we are updating the
[SPEAKER_00]: website behind the scenes as we speak.

[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can find my stuff at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I release feminized seeds,
they sell out very quickly.

for, have no fear because I will make more
[SPEAKER_00]: of all of these lines in the very near
future.
