[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is time for episode number 123 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_04]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_04]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_04]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you once again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to dedicate this episode to my
friend Zach.
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost Zach to cystic fibrosis this
month.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck you, cystic fibrosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Zach, I miss you and I love you,
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dab is for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a little dab because
Zach had cystic fibrosis and it messed
[SPEAKER_04]: with his lungs really badly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he took too big of a dab, he would
sound just like the bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to take a little dab for
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to breathe in some love.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to blow out some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dab is for you, brother Zach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody dab with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a big, nice dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zach, I'm going to miss you, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Tim also if you're listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tim, I hope we get together sometime soon
and celebrate Zach.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank
you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This episode will come mostly from the
Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Canna Canyon is my favorite cannabis
social lounge in Colorado Springs where we
[SPEAKER_04]: are allowed to congregate and socialize
and smoke recreational cannabis like a
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible adult should be allowed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before I get to that, I want to talk
about something I've been seeing on
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cannabis Cup for Colorado has been
canceled for the year 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be no Cannabis Cup over the 420
weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: High Times intended to have the event in
Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adams County, I believe it was,
rejected all of the permits and would not
[SPEAKER_04]: let High Times have their event.
[SPEAKER_04]: High Times had to scramble to find a new
location for the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: They opted to try Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put in applications for permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: They decided through that process that
there would not be enough time to
[SPEAKER_04]: advertise and organize a Cannabis Cup
should the event be approved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I've seen a lot on Facebook is
people bitching out High Times and people
[SPEAKER_04]: bitching out the city of Pueblo and people
bitching out the city of Denver for a
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis Cup not happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, this was a huge event.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of risk involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't blame any city for an event not
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Denver, they did kick High Times
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not approve the permit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we can be mad at them,
but it is not High Times' fault,
[SPEAKER_04]: nor is it Pueblo's fault that this event
did not happen in the backup plan of
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: High Times submitted the permits and High
Times also pulled the permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: They decided, or the applications for
permits, they decided to stop the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there wasn't enough time to get an
event together even if Pueblo did approve
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So High Times just decided to pull the
plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't blame it on anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's quit pointing fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's all be friends again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's dab like we used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be a community.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I have to say about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will talk a little bit about this in
the episode when my friends join me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since there is no Cannabis Cup,
you guys, let me invite you to the Secret
[SPEAKER_04]: Sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Secret Sesh is hosted by Gatsby
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have a ton of great sponsors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friend Adam Ill is coming from
California to host the event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Grammy Gatsby will be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our friend Dude It's Damsel will be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a lot of people there
dabbing, vending, having a grand 420 time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you can join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow Secret Sesh Colorado on Instagram
for more information.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I have more info, I will get it
to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I talked about doing an episode
about what you could do if you came to
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo for the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously there's no point in doing that
because you're not going to come here
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's not a Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize for teasing you about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's something you'd like to know
about the city of Pueblo, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_04]: send me an email
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will answer the email and we'll talk
about Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are talking about moving
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some things that you should know
and things you probably didn't think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about those.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you guys, I think it is time
for us to time warp.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to travel back in time to just
a couple of days ago when I met with my
[SPEAKER_04]: friend Camille with Stephen DeFino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else was there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kabuki J Fox and my new friend Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all gathered at the Cannon Canyon on
1507 Colorado Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Boulevard 1507 Colorado in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to time warp.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put on some music and we are
going to journey back in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we get back, we will be at the
Cannon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here at the Cannon Canyon in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camille, will you remind me the address,
please, because I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So come down to 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the Cannon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_04]: The couches are comfy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tables are covered in rigs and they've
got an email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guys, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitting a little further to my left is our
good friend Camille.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got such a great smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look great today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitting to my immediate left over here is
our good friend Stephen DeFino.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are the president and founder of the
Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here to my kind of far to the right
is our buddy Kabuki J Fox.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are awesome as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag run CBD all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag turps for tots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitting to my right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is kind of a new friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind me your name, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matthew Cale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matthew Cale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with an outfit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Veterans for Natural Rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of the individuals that helps out
with the event the other night at the DAB
[SPEAKER_02]: lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk a lot about that
before we get to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for joining me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get to the end, let me put a
disclaimer out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camille is working at the Cannon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is the host.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are you the owner here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am co-owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she may have to stand up and take off
and go for a run any given moment here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So excuse her if that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to get some of her stuff covered
in the beginning of the show here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing I want to talk about with
everybody, the Cannabis Cup for Colorado
[SPEAKER_04]: has officially been canceled.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're all stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure everybody here had an idea of
something they wanted to do for 420 and
[SPEAKER_04]: for the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side, I will say I am fairly
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is going to be kind of
the turn of 420 being about private
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the Secret Sesh is happening up in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planning on doing something as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk too much about what we're
planning on doing, but I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is kind of a new wave of a
different 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way that you put that because
that kind of works me into part of what I
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to talk about, the importance of
consumption clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since they're not going to let us have
large events like that, we need to have
[SPEAKER_04]: places like the Canna Canyon to consume
our cannabis for people to come and
[SPEAKER_04]: socialize.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we're doing is hanging out and
consuming cannabis and being friends here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we definitely need something like
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before I get to that, let's talk about
the Veteran Farmers Alliance event that
[SPEAKER_04]: happened a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give you a huge shout out,
Stephen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a huge event.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people do you think showed up?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say, what do you think, Matt?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably a little over 200?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a little more than that,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: 250 and 300.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throughout the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy, 300.
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 to 7, and we were there from like,
we didn't leave until like 11 or 10 that
[SPEAKER_06]: night.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Stephen hosted an event at the Dab
Lounge in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another social smoke lounge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, Dan, for letting us host
that event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a super nice event.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to that, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Stephen hosted an event there called
the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that an official title, or was it just
the Veteran Farmers Alliance?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get Together, Party, Smoke Out,
Sesh, Four Point Time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
Veteran Farmers Alliance?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the Veteran Farmers Alliance
brings the community together,
[SPEAKER_05]: brings veterans together with civilians,
brings breeders together, growers
[SPEAKER_05]: together, nutrient manufacturers,
and just glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just takes everybody and brings them
all in one place and allows these guys to
[SPEAKER_05]: have free genetics, free information,
education, all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're able to get it in one
centralized location to where they can
[SPEAKER_05]: have good medicine, they can get the best
medicine that's out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not this watered down crap.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, these are fresh genetics, good
genetics, and these guys care.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had 300 people came through this
event inside of the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had breeders set up with their booths.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had seeds available.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had nutrient companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had glass companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of these companies threw down
stacks of merchandise for the veterans.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was tons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask you about what the value of the
prizes you gave away that day without
[SPEAKER_04]: being rude?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the total value was just a little
over $12,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: $12,000 with the products given to
veterans to help them grow better
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, to fight their PTSD,
their pain, their depression, their
[SPEAKER_04]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I want to give you a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hugely respectable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also thanks to these guys to the
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all showed up and dabbed with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to the Run CBD hoodie.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked sharp on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look good in purple, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look good in the picture, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check us out on Instagram, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in Colorado Springs tonight,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last night, there was a city council
meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's facial expressions all just
changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's body language just deflated a
little.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this city council meeting, a lot of
things went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in another city.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to keep up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I understand is they have put a
moratorium on more social clubs like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in eight years, are all clubs like
this forced to close?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the moratorium was actually set in
place back in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six months, the moratorium set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are re-approaching that six month
mark of the moratorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think they're just trying to
establish what they want to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they decided was they wanted to
ban them, originally supposed to be for
[SPEAKER_00]: five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they extended it to eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a blow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, this is what the
voters wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very passionate about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to fight for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like your faith in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that it's written, does that mean
that in eight years, you have to close?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In eight years, by March 2024,
we will have to close our doors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And isn't there a second vote coming to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another vote on March 22nd,
the second round of votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, a lot can happen in eight
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana can become federally legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could go the opposite direction as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the pendulum is swinging the
other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it at least gives us a little bit of
time to get a ballot referendum to allow
[SPEAKER_02]: these kind of clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gives us a little bit of time to
force legislation on the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Jonathan Singer himself and also
the representative Kit Roop from Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: Springs himself, he's backing a bill to
legalize these types of clubs statewide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are already we already know that
there is a lot of support here in Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, Kit Roop wouldn't be on board.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think another thing that really spoke
volumes about that as well was the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that showed up for that initial
meeting on like February 22nd,
[SPEAKER_00]: 24th.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a standing room only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I think there was only like
two people out of like one hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty plus that were against these clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the majority of those people there
were very much so for them, about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the community has spoken.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I saw the I watched part of the meeting
on the Internet the other day and the
[SPEAKER_04]: place was packed once again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got passionate this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to see our friend from the lazy
lion to the ears off the city council.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind me that guy's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some very well spoken words
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to put that one out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone had to face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad that he chose to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's a veteran also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to the veterans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool that he came and supported,
supported the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast majority of people there were
veterans.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the two city council members?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steven, grab the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went to resolve and I asked I asked
the city council members, I said,
[SPEAKER_05]: how many of you are veterans?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, just by a show of hands,
show me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not one of them raised their hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't acknowledge that they were
veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are veterans.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the other veterans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's disrespectful to their service.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that when they go other places,
they get a veteran's discount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I get a veteran's?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they raise their hand then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, they didn't raise their
hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I asked, I turned around and said,
how many veterans are behind me?
[SPEAKER_05]: And like three quarters of the room raised
their hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Veterans, medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these guys don't understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a cry for help.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all those guys that raise their hands,
all those guys and girls, we have to say
[SPEAKER_05]: that they raised their hands and it's like
they didn't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an emotional cry for help,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people breaking down on the
stand, talking about the importance of
[SPEAKER_02]: these clubs and the importance of these
gathering places because they can't go
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have lease agreements.
[SPEAKER_02]: That prevent them from smoking in their
own homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are people who serve their country
and they're not allowed to take part in
[SPEAKER_02]: the freedoms that they're guaranteed by
the constitution of the state they live
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a travesty.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could almost just end the show right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was that's yeah, that's exactly
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit about the
importance of these clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got something to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just going to say and not to
mention shout out to the Dab Lounge for
[SPEAKER_00]: providing an awesome space for those
veterans to have the Veterans Farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it wasn't for these social
clubs, that community wouldn't be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: be brought together as easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I gave veterans Dabs for their first
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a veterans event.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met four sets of parents that had
special needs children that were curious
[SPEAKER_06]: about cannabis and curious about CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny that places like this bring
all sorts of patients throughout the
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrum together in some way or another.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we help each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's just lending an ear and
understanding or being available and being
[SPEAKER_06]: introduced to someone and networking with
someone that can help us.
[SPEAKER_06]: These clubs are absolutely essential to
anyone who really is seeking a healthy
[SPEAKER_06]: social outlet in our community to not only
discuss cannabis, but why it works for
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really can't see anything healthier.
[SPEAKER_06]: It saddens me to see it go the way that it
has.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm happy to help fight it in any way
possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of any other word.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just makes me sad, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working here also, I mean, we see all
types of members as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that really kind of stands
out to me is the amount of questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: people have that they're scared to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's about CBD or THC or the
benefits or edibles or proper dosing or
[SPEAKER_06]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Information that they might not get.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dispensary, sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that was just adding on that
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were having a conversation as friends
at the front counter just a few minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: ago, just smoking dabs, talking about
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the folks behind us were learning
everything we were saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were absorbing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those people in that group was
learning from us on accident.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The education and support they get just
from showing up here is crucial.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can go to a bar and drink alcohol until
we die.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can physically drink enough alcohol at
the bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you drink that whole bottle of whatever
you choose, it will kill you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can come here and no one's going to
let you smoke enough cannabis to hurt
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think you can smoke enough
cannabis to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say you could probably get high and
do some dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to argue that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, no one's going to let
anybody that's that high leave here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have each other's backs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We look out for each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen anybody getting in our...
And that's what's different about bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these consumption clubs, I think that
that's one of the points that I brought up
[SPEAKER_02]: in the testimony the other day was,
you know, we may have had, what,
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 combat veterans packed into a club.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could not have done that in an
establishment serving alcohol and had a
[SPEAKER_02]: peaceful night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was packed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have I have a past with alcohol and we
don't get along very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it were at a place that served
alcohol, there's way less likely of a
[SPEAKER_04]: chance that I would have gone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of these guys, it's the same
way, you know, these these veterans,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially, you know, they they've
self-medicated with alcohol before in
[SPEAKER_02]: their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've self-medicated with pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things are harmful to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they they hurt them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hurt them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're their families.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hurt their their friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, they hurt their own bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but this it doesn't it brings them
back into society.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings them back into this community
that we can sit there and help each other
[SPEAKER_02]: and take care of one another like we
should.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way you put things,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad we got to become friends and hang
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy's real good with the words there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the first time I met everybody in
this group, the first time, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: Kabuki, I met you at a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave me some of that delicious banana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these two guys, the first time I met
them, Steven, I met here at the Canna
[SPEAKER_04]: Canyon and I've met you at the event last
weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without the social clubs, I wouldn't be
making all these friends that I've got.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_04]: This little educational support group that
we got.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what's so important, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in my event, there was guys that
haven't come out of isolation over a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: They came out and medicated and they were
stacked deep, you know, 50, almost 55
[SPEAKER_05]: people at times in that little club.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that little nobody freaked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody was under good medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: The PTSD guys, you could see they were
ready to leave.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some of them stayed the entire
night, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stayed the entire night.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that I know for a fact have severe
problems with crowds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were there the entire night and they
were dedicated to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They loved the fact that we were having
that event, that so many other people
[SPEAKER_02]: around them had their back.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were giving out free food all night,
which I thought was super awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like all day, all night, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Dab Docs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys really took care of our guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody told me it was free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was, I think it was a free
meatball sub or a free hot dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a free drink, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have gone for the drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had chips too, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I survived.
[SPEAKER_04]: My vegan homie.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were POWs there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were every type of military there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there were Dab kids there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there were normal civilians there
that you couldn't tell what walk of life
[SPEAKER_04]: they came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's funny is we we opened up the Dab
bar from five to six.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we kept it open until about six to
15.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the guys that came in were like,
we always, you know, we asked them first
[SPEAKER_05]: for the Dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever Dab before?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you take big Dabs, little Dabs?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we were trying to be polite and
make sure these guys weren't over
[SPEAKER_05]: medicating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was sending them over there all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these guys, nobody made it through
over two rounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a couple of guys show up pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watching them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're like, oh, yeah, we take big
Dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, are you sure?
[SPEAKER_04]: I told Ryan from the seed company,
remind me his seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pollination.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that was one of our biggest donators,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Ryan from Pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was giving out huge Dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He globbed me out a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to take a second and list off
the sponsors and the people that threw
[SPEAKER_04]: down stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: They deserve a nice shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if I can go down the list.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got we got Nectar for the Gods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pollination.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Nectar for the Gods.
[SPEAKER_05]: They donated like 55 cases and 25 bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Surrounded the pool table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely surrounded a full sized pool
table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was it was awesome to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Charlemagne Extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: They donated the Galaxy E-Nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pollination also donated the Mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Smoke and Iguana.
[SPEAKER_05]: They donated that that flow rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: That thing was really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Recycler.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Rocky Mountain Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Pistol Positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pistol Positive Creations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boneyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boneyard Seeds out of Cali.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Belushi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blues Brothers Genetics.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Covert Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Belushi listens to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scapegoat Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scapegoat Genetics.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, they donated a ton of packs too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Concentrated Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They donated.
[SPEAKER_05]: He donated a whole bunch of really
interesting crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cookies and Cream.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of really neat stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fox Genetics threw down a whole bunch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fox Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: The CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: He threw down like a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you might have won a pack, I might have
walked away with a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had D's Tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, D's Tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, that tea was incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had the CBD and the THC tea and was
giving it out all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who had the cake balls?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, those ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were made by the Strong Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are a spousal support group for
veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made those cake pops by hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the best cake balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally still have a dozen in my room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even going to walk in front.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sierra has a small problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's got an issue with those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're delicious though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kept leaving them on my table like
devil's advocate, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't eat one because I saw the way
everybody was acting over them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, if I eat one of those,
I'm going to eat like 30 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Tammy Dominguez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Tammy.
[SPEAKER_02]: She hooked it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had Nate Tuesday from CB1
Analytics.
[SPEAKER_05]: He came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was collecting stuff to get tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who threw down the light?
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody threw down a gorilla.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Indomax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad Higgins from Indomax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: He threw down the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice of Brad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who won the e-mail?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give that guy a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember his name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I sure don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: He won the mothership and the e-mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool because he came out of
nowhere and seemed kind of shy.
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was sort of a goofy dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also won the SIFS pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That dude killed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He walked away with a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was even better.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could tell he wanted to buddy up with
somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just didn't know who to buddy up with
at the event, and he bumped into Steven
[SPEAKER_04]: and made friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, it was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't take anybody in as a friend
because you're a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he might have been a veteran.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You two bonded right away and made
buddies, and then he won.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really great to see that guy win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Dry Sift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, got the screens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to see the screens myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually gave away some screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the guy next to your booth?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was D's Tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The covert was to the right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was pretty much done by the
time you got there, McVean.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was bugging him all day for CBD Tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a huge event.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of sponsors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got more?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we had 16, 20 unofficials.
[SPEAKER_05]: They donated 450 hash caps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they gave me a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably like an ounce and a half,
two ounces worth of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who grew all the weed that you were
donating to people?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now you're putting me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave away the chem dog and the Gorilla
Glue four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stephon Bennett, he gave me like an ounce
and a half of Harlequin, and then me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I left that Harlequin in your grinder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave you about an ounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I gave away about an ounce of my New
York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave away some Sherbert, gave away some
Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: We rolled up probably half an ounce in
joints, gave those out, and that was just
[SPEAKER_05]: a mix between all my strains that I
usually carry around with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got there and you walked up and didn't
have time to talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, hey man, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Want a joint?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was busy, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were so many people I wanted to talk
to that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wanted to get you on the show that
day, but I could see it in your eye that
[SPEAKER_04]: you were pretty much done by the time the
event was over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was spent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the first event I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it went down pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have a veteran that was upset the
way it was going down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had him come back and I talked to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He brought up a good point on some things,
so I hooked him up with a case of
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it, like five or seven packs of
genetics, some soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: He left happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he left very happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: My organization, I don't charge any
membership fees to these veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've already paid enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys shouldn't have to pay a penny
out of their pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if somebody's a veteran in the
Colorado Springs area, a cannabis user,
[SPEAKER_04]: and needs some help, how can they get in
touch with you?
[SPEAKER_05]: They can get in touch with me at the
Veteran Farmers Alliance at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear that, you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steven will help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Veteran Farmers Alliance will take
good care of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll invite you to our next event.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next event, I said hour, like I'm in
the chair now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll probably be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're always welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always.
Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Veteran Farmers Alliance just doesn't
stop there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes organizations that are out there
and brings them all together in one place
[SPEAKER_05]: so veterans have an access to care.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can reach out to each organization
that has these specialties and use that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever pertains to them, whatever
matches up with that organization in them,
[SPEAKER_05]: they use that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, once they're done, they can come see
the other organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they can use all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they have this central network hub of
actual ... They can go to outreach
[SPEAKER_05]: functions.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can go to different events.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can go high hiking.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can go fishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bringing these organizations.
[SPEAKER_05]: This alternate therapy is just another way
of helping these guys heal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being able to offer them that,
that's like nobody's ever been able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wants to make things a
competition, but yet we're trying to save
[SPEAKER_05]: lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need to all come together and stop
the BS and just say, hey, we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: take care of these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't take care of them, but you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take them.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're done with them, I'll take care
of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm done with them, you go to that
next organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to save lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's drop this piddly bullshit and let's
start doing what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Veterans Unite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: People need to see that the community and
veterans can come together and they can
[SPEAKER_05]: integrate together and they can socialize
and there's no drama.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do that in a bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody says the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody's drunk, move, folk PTSD or this
or that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, somebody's going to get something
in the face.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to a cannabis club and people are
able to sit back, relax, get some
[SPEAKER_05]: education.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, throw some knowledge to these
guys and maybe show these guys what's
[SPEAKER_05]: really up with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some people go in there,
they're scared.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the clubs in town offer
free entry for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lazy lion does the dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's veterans that are out there
that are maybe intimidated or nervous,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're very accepting, very welcoming to
definitely veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely appreciate all of your
service.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned PTSD and you know,
veterans are the public face of it right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, but they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that we are really a tiny portion
of the people in society that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast majority are actually women and
we may be fighting a fight for our rights
[SPEAKER_02]: right now with PTSD, but we know that
we're still fighting for the people who
[SPEAKER_02]: are way too hurt, too scared, too angry,
too ashamed, too afraid, locked up in
[SPEAKER_02]: their home somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fighting for them too in order for
their rights to be recognized as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: ours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are intimidated to come to a
social smoke lounge, the Canna Canyon has
[SPEAKER_04]: classy leather couches.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: The walls are clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So soft.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stylish hardwood floors.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kabuki and I met here for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kabuki and Steven met here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, community, building community here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the place is classy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super clean, handicap accessible restroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great place, so don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's well lit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The music's not too loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can conversate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can conversate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camille says it's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can conversate in here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it together, Wester.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a dictionary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashtag classy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like, if you're new at
smoking, if you're not a dab kid,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're not into the whole scene,
we'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you your first dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't make you choke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll teach you how to use the rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll educate you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are bottles of water on the shelf
over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be well taken care of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other than that, there's no legal
place for people to congregate and
[SPEAKER_04]: consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to go somewhere and smoke,
other than hanging out in the car behind
[SPEAKER_04]: some building or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or being out somewhere in public,
which we're technically legally not
[SPEAKER_06]: allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be respectful of others,
I don't feel the need for others to smell
[SPEAKER_06]: my medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just me being considerate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also, as a patient and as someone
who's over the age of 21 recreationally,
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have a lot of safe places to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not everyone works in the industry or
has made their lifestyle around everything
[SPEAKER_06]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in those moments where a patient or a
occasional recreational user might want a
[SPEAKER_06]: safe place to enjoy cannabis, what are we
going to do if these places aren't around?
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to go do something shady.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact is, is that if they pass laws
banning these types of establishments,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to push people out into
their public spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who wants to smell weed wherever they
go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to smell weed wherever they
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want a safe place to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a large majority of people out
there who probably aren't going to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: smell weed in the public parks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you give people bars so they won't
sit on a public park bench drinking
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere?
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about the cannabis life,
but I do have a daughter that I don't hide
[SPEAKER_04]: her from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't hide cannabis from her.
[SPEAKER_04]: She knows what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is not attracted to the smell of it at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think that anybody should have
to be at the park with their child and
[SPEAKER_04]: explain what those guys over there are
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, no, that's not to be your fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to talk with my daughter about
that today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be anybody's fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should decide when that conversation
happens.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep that in mind, you guys don't go
dabbing at the park.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone just looks at me like,
no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a daughter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I very much feel the same way,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in city council meeting and I looked
up, I was like, how many liquor stores are
[SPEAKER_05]: there in Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, hmm, 104.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, how many bars are there in
Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_05]: 188.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: But 15 cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, everybody loses their shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like when they did the whole
caregiver act.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's not even 1% of the people
that grow in Colorado are caregivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they sneak something in at that city
council meeting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and they didn't even talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That pissed me off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they wanted to restrict the residential
plan count to 12 plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: 12.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So huge problem with that in the fact that
I have a large concentration of pediatric
[SPEAKER_06]: patients here that they're not even
epilepsy for the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: They rely on a heavy supply of T-rex.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a heavy material and 12 plants
sometimes doesn't even cut 60 days of
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine for them, depending on what
they're working with.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, most of these guys are,
you know, they're not commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not, you know, they're modestly
growing organically and getting,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, decent yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these parents can do a lot better with
some, you know, with more decent numbers,
[SPEAKER_06]: but restricting it to 12, I feel is just,
it's going to cause caregivers a lot more
[SPEAKER_06]: headaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to cause parents who are trying
to grow themselves because they can't go
[SPEAKER_06]: to dispensaries to get what they need
because they might not have it or whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: the case is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel that it's unfair and very
unjust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about to say, it seems like
time and time again, it kind of feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not getting what we voted for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's upsetting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like they're pushing the medical
market away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And forcing everybody to go shop at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to get rid of the caregivers and
they want all of the tax money.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actively pushing for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are senators who are trying to
take away homegrown as we speak this this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I saw some language off of I'm
going to go ahead and call her out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senator Conti, her desk that wanted to
limit all caregivers and patients in the
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: To six plants maximum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this would not only affect
individuals, but it would affect
[SPEAKER_02]: structures so that an apartment complex
complex would have a maximum of six plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in that apartment complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I lived in the same apartment
building.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be screwed over plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're then committing a felony.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's and both of us are committing a
felony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, thankfully we managed to get
that that language removed from that bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of issues like this
that are coming up that are coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: from the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're being actively lobbied for
by recreational and and some medical
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities to ones that are joint medical
rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're trying to eliminate medical
rights and push everybody into the
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of those dispensary owners have
issues with clubs like this because they
[SPEAKER_04]: think that it's going to ruin their
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has it yet?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that we've noticed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our shop is still open.
[SPEAKER_04]: This place is still open.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every one of the business owners that
I know, they are all happy for wanting
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all for licensing.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of these people that I know that run
these clubs have an altar motive to take
[SPEAKER_06]: money from any establishment, but to
provide a service for people that is
[SPEAKER_06]: genuinely needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's my honest two cents.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't work for any of these clubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, visit them from time to time
and that's just honestly how I feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're here every time I'm here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: The time I show up, I don't mention I'm
coming and you're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, man, what can I say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Great minds think alike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camille, you look like you got something
you want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did and I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Camille.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some Black Cherry Kim live resin
on the table, which, by the way,
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bred it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grew it over at the Green and Healthy
Garden and then our friends at TURPEX
[SPEAKER_04]: blasted that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to the whole crew there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's called synergy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Synergy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a lot to say about the 12 plant
limit, don't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very upset over this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm basically allergic to every single
prescription pill out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one I'm not allergic to.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of listeners might not be familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tell us a little bit briefly about your
injury.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so on April 11th of 2008, I was doing
route clearance as a combat engineer in
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadr City, and I was hit by... Be more
specific with Sadr City.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in Iraq.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, a lot of our listeners will know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's specify that right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were ambushed and the fifth IED that
went off blew a 13 inch hole into my
[SPEAKER_05]: vehicle and blew a five inch hole into my
back, causing my hip to be shattered.
[SPEAKER_05]: My pelvis to be broken and my spine to be
shifted forward, causing me to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit of spinal injury.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had over 200 pieces of shrapnel in me
and it took about three and a half months
[SPEAKER_05]: for the wound to close up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very lucky to be alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for pulling through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Steve.
[SPEAKER_05]: For real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Steve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the listeners, it looks like if
you took a normal dude's back and excuse
[SPEAKER_04]: me if I'm... No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could put my fist in the hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly how I describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: To fill the hole with putty would take
your fist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife, she jokes, she's like,
all we need to do is slap a little Bondo
[SPEAKER_05]: on it and let it stick and paint that shit
and it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some spackle.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Continuing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But the whole 12 plant count thing,
I consume so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ingest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use topicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: For them to cut me down to 12 when I have
a 65 plant count is asinine.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way for them to judge who needs
what.
[SPEAKER_05]: The standard, whatever, they're not
medical doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent three hours with my medical doctor
going over my plant program, failure
[SPEAKER_05]: rates, pesticide rates, clone failure
rates, successful harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fan failures, light failures.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go over that and then we're like,
okay, we have finished product.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what's usable.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't usable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then for city council to have no training
in the medical field, to not even
[SPEAKER_05]: understand what a plant count means to
somebody, to not even understand what
[SPEAKER_05]: level of a grower they're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unforgivable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an insult.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to abide by it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I paid for that extended plant
count.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have proven every right why I need that
plant count.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are not going to take that away
from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should stand up in court.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will be filing a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to file a lawsuit against the
city of Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will your lawyer come to court with you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or your doctor?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have over 6,000 pages of medical
documents that can prove to them that in
[SPEAKER_05]: every single manner they are wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got better SOPs than some
dispensaries I've gone to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your notation and note taking and your
planning is better than some major grows
[SPEAKER_04]: in this state, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I take this seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what keeps me alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can people follow you on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to give out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: My Instagram name is triceratops.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got some great pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: A grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Triceratops on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a hell of a great grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely one of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do a great job with that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would not have met these guys if
it weren't for a club, so I'm very
[SPEAKER_04]: grateful right now for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's nothing crazy going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's slamming into walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's arguing or fighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no drama.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a question for Camille,
but she just took a big old dab,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I'm going to give her half a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: You good?
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever had anybody act up or try to
fight in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fight?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: She looked at me all like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: A fight in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the craziest thing that happened was we
like to keep a certain atmosphere for our
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So occasionally we'll have a member come
in who is intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that moment, we try and scooch him
out as fast as possible, but occasionally
[SPEAKER_00]: they will get into the main lounge just by
people exiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been one instance where we had
to escort someone off the premises,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went kind of willingly, so that
helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were drunk too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, we just had to deal with a couple
of drunk people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That completely proved my point.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only problems at the cannabis social
lounge were the drunk people that showed
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I can really appreciate too
is more than once we've had members kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of bring something that someone has left
up to the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kabuki is notorious for leaving stuff
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left my wallet on the counter here
earlier and it was promptly returned to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you call it members?
[SPEAKER_00]: Members, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another member shouted, who's wallet?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a place where people look out for
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a safe location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of the problems that they
had with the city council meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that it wasn't safe,
but these are safe places.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sounded so uneducated at the meeting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing going to happen here
unless city council comes and causes a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really frustrating is... All of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt was talking... Is it okay if I call
you Matt or do you prefer Matt doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt was talking about Kit Ruppey and...
Is that how you pronounce it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Ruppey?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Senator Kit Ruppey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm messing his name all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, man, Kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been working on this license
for the clubs and they came out and said
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing's made in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's frustrating is it feels like
city council does not have that mentality
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't seem to grasp or understand a
few different sides, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans, people who consume on a
recreational level, or even just business
[SPEAKER_00]: owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't seem to want to listen to
what we have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Kit Ruppey and Jonathan Singer
are doing some really awesome progressive
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff with the licensing and trying to
make these clubs appear to stay,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I can appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Colorado Springs, whole another story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the same issues in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like our city council hears us
and we're like, we want social clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they turn around and they talk to each
other and they turn around and they go,
[SPEAKER_04]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: No social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy how that happens too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just like, yeah, have these
conversations right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's insane.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And aren't they there to represent us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't we supposed to be telling them what
they want?
[SPEAKER_04]: They provide it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then 200 people show up and they say,
we want this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two people say no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole city council can say,
oh yeah, no.
You brought that up, Kit Ruppey.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you were saying it's a stack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredibly upsetting to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sorry if I'm for a lack of words at the
moment, but yeah, that is infuriating to
[SPEAKER_06]: see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like four people come up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weight is bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're spitting out facts that you
could go on the internet and it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, that's been disproven.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're reading shit off a piece of paper,
not looking anyone in the eye,
[SPEAKER_06]: then walking out of the room right
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's stacked because they had the
people that were for against all go up
[SPEAKER_05]: first.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like, you know, normal sessions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's allowed to voice their
opinion, whether for or against,
[SPEAKER_05]: equally at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That way you can hear both sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's they said their thing and they
got to leave because they're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, we're not going to make these old
people stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's who it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that were complaining were over
60.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you made a very bad point,
Matt, about a lot of these complaints for
[SPEAKER_05]: madness propaganda.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people that were making these
complaints are more about the opposition
[SPEAKER_06]: of what happened after we've voted in
amendment 64 than about the clubs
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like that distinction was
completely lost in translation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most of them like they would say
things like my I live next door to an
[SPEAKER_02]: apartment complex and the people there,
they smoke, they smoke marijuana's and
[SPEAKER_02]: they they they grow the marijuana's and
they vent it right out into the open and
[SPEAKER_02]: it stinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like it had nothing to do with the
actual consumption clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just they were complaining about
the ancillary effects of Amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just stuck in the mud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they have a problem with it,
then they should take it up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: voters who actually voted Amendment 64
into our state constitution as a
[SPEAKER_04]: constitution right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of stepping up now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love when people call it marijuana's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, marijuana's the marijuana's.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're highly pluralized it
because we know so much about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Them marijuana's.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it when people pluralize CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: The CBD's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you say THC's?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a glass of waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sometimes have some shit on my chest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just need to get off on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't even get on the left lane drivers
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these clubs are important, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do everything we can to get
city council to Well, what can we do for
[SPEAKER_04]: the next eight years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything we can do to sway them
on that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that a permanent thing here in
Springs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, what I can say is that there
are petitions at a lot of the clubs here
[SPEAKER_00]: in town to kind of what's the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: Recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recall the the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put your name on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your city know that this is not
something you're down for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we can do initially.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an online petition as well,
Steven says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steven and Camille are politely sharing a
mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes Steven gets cut off here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking for the petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's searching in his phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since I am not a Colorado Springs
resident, am I able to sign that petition?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's a Colorado state thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will sign that for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a Pueblo resident.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kabuki, you're going to be a Pueblo guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I have said that on the show?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come find me in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited, dude.

[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Want everybody in Colorado to sign it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a computer nerd, figure out some
way to set up your computer and proxy in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Change your IP address every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do it a billion times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say that on the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hire some kid in Malaysia to do it on
Fiverr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to argue with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also in the cannabis community,
after that whole city council thing went
[SPEAKER_05]: down, a lot of people are talking about
running for office now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone needs to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kabuki.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with that is a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's happening in the Springs right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we obviously need a voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a voice on that council.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it also starts with maybe
removing if these people who are supposed
[SPEAKER_06]: to represent us won't listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then maybe they shouldn't be representing
us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's their job is to listen to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe getting that rotten apple out of
the bunch and trying to progressively put
[SPEAKER_06]: someone who will voice all of our
concerns.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, yeah, we do need to find
someone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish I had the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know there are much more people out
there, much more qualified to do something
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would willingly back them 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox tracks, run CBD genetics, and just me
as a person, as an advocate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's got to teach them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There needs to be education.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys have no education.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're basing all of their decisions on
their emotions and, you know, the 50 year
[SPEAKER_05]: old argument to them, the most outdated
medical information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's happening is when you have
maybe seven people come up and say no,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have over 200 people willing to
testify that they want something,
[SPEAKER_05]: you should be supporting the people that
want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's what the people want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not it's fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it's it's insane to me that you
can not even just hear or try to shove it
[SPEAKER_06]: to make 200 people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, was it less than 12 people that
came up against it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it didn't seem 11.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So less than a dozen people to like 200
people in a room, mostly veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was about 30 minutes of testimony
in five hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five hours of testimony.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even after all that, you know,
you disrespect other veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even acknowledge that you're a
veteran.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you sit there and you have these
smart ass looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't one of them nodding off?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looked like one of them was
falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrew called them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad someone did, because that would
have made me furious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have thrown a shoe at that dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you got guys, girls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your only job is to cry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your only job is to stay awake.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're all over 60.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, most of them are over 65.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're going to be passing
these little gems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's pass it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're over 50, it's time to leave
office.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there the right to redo the entire
meeting since somebody fell asleep?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a member not present for the
ADA.
[SPEAKER_05]: They they didn't even represent deaf
people there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, have a person that does sign
language there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's good with the legal shit in Springs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that meeting can be totally redone
since a city council member took a nap
[SPEAKER_04]: during the meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need a redo on that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe since there wasn't something there
for deaf people so that they could hear
[SPEAKER_04]: and participate as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need a redo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need to try that one over.
[SPEAKER_04]: We absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us out if you can, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see how this second vote
will go on.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the one's the date?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: March 22nd.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can the public come to that one again?
That's a private vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're not going to actually allow
public comment on that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I stand outside and look like we
can protest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, protest actually is our best bet
right now is to call like a massive amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of people and show people how unhappy we
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still don't think that that will
actually sway their vote, but it would at
[SPEAKER_02]: least show them what they're doing is
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are starting to assemble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we are active and that we can we can
actually change the face of politics in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Springs and we can get them out
of office.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen it done in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've I've hiked up to the
Capitol plenty of times to stop this shit,
[SPEAKER_06]: for lack of better words.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've so many of those that they've
tried to pass with children not being able
[SPEAKER_06]: to Medicaid on school grounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Them trying to CPS trying to say that any
parent with a red card was, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: basically, you know, endangering,
endangering their child.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if they had just a whole bunch
of shit that we've had to go through.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like in the Springs,
first of all, educating people about
[SPEAKER_06]: what's going on, just like we did in
Denver and bringing making people aware of
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like like Matt said, getting
people together to actually show that we
[SPEAKER_06]: can be the face of change.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do need that down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: These clubs are essential.
[SPEAKER_06]: Limiting that plant count is absolute
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been getting phone calls nonstop from
these parents that are freaking out about
[SPEAKER_06]: that and patients that are freaking out
because they're actively growing anywhere
[SPEAKER_06]: from, you know, whatever, you know,
24 to 36 to 60 plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever the case is, depending on their
needs, without a problem, without there
[SPEAKER_06]: ever being overages or stacks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they still come short up for
their medicine when it comes time to be
[SPEAKER_06]: processed, even with that many plants,
depending on what they grow and how they
[SPEAKER_06]: grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just think it's insane for an Olympic
city to talk about limiting what patients
[SPEAKER_06]: can't and cannot grow and how they can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just upsets me so much that that also
wasn't talked about enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't, you know, yeah, the focus on
the club is equally important,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I feel like there's sliding one in
with the other and that's horseshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that needs to be addressed more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like within the group of
everyone that's for the clubs and and I
[SPEAKER_06]: don't think enough people are aware about
these plant counts.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I if we bring both these groups of
people together, that have this the same
[SPEAKER_06]: invested interest, I think we'd have a
greater showing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just, you know, my personal
opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm more than happy to reach out to the
people that I know that are really coming
[SPEAKER_06]: at me and are distraught about them,
you know, cutting down the residential
[SPEAKER_06]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, you know, we know all the
veterans and all our friends and all our
[SPEAKER_06]: colleagues that are in this business and
are for these clubs that are doing amazing
[SPEAKER_06]: things in the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get together.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the only way we're going to make a
change is to put any little thing aside
[SPEAKER_06]: and come together so we can actually show
them the real numbers and the real faces
[SPEAKER_06]: of the people that they're affecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we'd be so bold to to show
them, give them maybe a preview of what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to happen if they ban these clubs on
the 22nd?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say we get a thousand people out
there by city council and just smoke it
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's show them what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, massive civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that might be what it takes to
show them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we want our clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to do this, but maybe this
is an example we need to set.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does that lead us and how?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so and that was something I don't know
if it was you or somebody else brought a
[SPEAKER_06]: point of about Manitou and then being in
the same El Paso County and them allowing
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have clubs in Manitou or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so I just don't understand how you're
going to allow these different assets,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, these even with medical medical
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a time down here in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a ton of places where medical and
recreational patients can go and be taken
[SPEAKER_06]: care of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then where do they go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just the truth of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's why are you setting up your.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the police chief.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just to not to jump on my note,
but he came in the room and basically
[SPEAKER_06]: said, this is this is not enforceable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then that being said, that's coming
from the words of the police chief of our
[SPEAKER_06]: city, basically telling us that there's
really no way for them to be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: enforce this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you say he put in nine hundred
hours of man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine thousand hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Investigating these clubs and still unable
to bring a single that could have sent off
[SPEAKER_06]: a kid to college and whatever it was in
our tax money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm just saying, like, that's
stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine thousand hours divided by 40 hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other cops probably work week.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many cops was that for?
[SPEAKER_04]: How much time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For one club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Citizens of Colorado Springs, you paid for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was your money, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our money.
[SPEAKER_04]: No charges brought nine thousand hours at
a cop's wage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what you guys paid for them to
come and hang out at one of these clubs
[SPEAKER_04]: with us and try to mingle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they still don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably came here and got stoned and
hung out and had a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch cartoons and eat pizza.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's also it creates a little
confusion because you have the council
[SPEAKER_06]: saying one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Police chief is telling you another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the citizens saying a completely
different thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's being heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a couple.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pushing their own agendas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the police isn't going to
enforce it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the citizens obviously want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only a matter of time when that wall
breaks and we just keep pushing forward.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have a question for Camille.
[SPEAKER_05]: If now that they've done this,
they've given you eight years to recoup
[SPEAKER_05]: your funds and there's no regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't that reopen the black market?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourages the Craigslist seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It encourages deals going on behind in
parks, behind schools and parking lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that encourages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have tourists, like I said,
jumping on Craigslist, looking for four
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty weed, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that were brought up at
the meeting for the licensing with Katie
[SPEAKER_00]: Payne, Jonathan Singer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just not thinking it through
like at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the outside image,
even though you can see through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about what it brings to other
cities or other businesses that may want
[SPEAKER_04]: to come to this city.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very military town.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of military influence here
and and church and church.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, our weird kind of area.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to keep that image.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to look like Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to have that clean military
churchy feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unfortunately, the data goes the
other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: After they legalized marijuana,
soldiers pissing hot actually went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it went in the opposite direction now
that it's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they know it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're just going to wait until they
get out and then they're going to use it
[SPEAKER_05]: without having to use it and get in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they'll do their you know,
and that's how most veterans that I know
[SPEAKER_06]: even felt being out of state, out of
medical states is, you know, they do their
[SPEAKER_06]: time or, you know, they serve their tour,
whatever the case was, and come back and
[SPEAKER_06]: medicate and be done with the whole thing,
grow in their beard and be happy,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow in the beard.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when you come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, why fuck it up while
you're working, you know, if those if your
[SPEAKER_06]: employer says you can't, then obviously
that's the rule of the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's how you're getting your money,
you know, if that's what's paying for your
[SPEAKER_06]: school, why jeopardize it, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know more people that think about it
that way than the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, that's also asking
someone not to medicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a very hard choice that people
have to make to make all those decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it's a double edged sword on
that thought, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to that thought of this place being a
church heavy military town, dude,
[SPEAKER_06]: I know more housewives than girls I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That consumed cannabis, you know,
that's such a closeted thing in this
[SPEAKER_06]: community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that show weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the biggest growing demographic of
weed smokers is above 55.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are retired relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elderly people are flocking to Colorado in
order to retire because they want to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: weed when they retire.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they can get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a ton of tourists who become
members who are definitely older,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of want the experience,
ask questions like, well, what does a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: What what are people saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing called the Salvia or sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just educating these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really just want to experience it for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to have people like you here to
invite those people into the community and
[SPEAKER_04]: welcome and show them how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With welcoming arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, totally.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and you're here half the time,
Kabuki, to share in the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of those people are profoundly
grateful that these places exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they I mean, and it showed that
the other night, I mean, a lot of them
[SPEAKER_02]: broke down into tears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, you got people that just bought
their first medicine or their first
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, their first dab there in their
car.
[SPEAKER_04]: First marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: First marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: First marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to have you guys seen that there's
a documentary where the dudes light in the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom of the pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you go home and try that because
you don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's your brand new.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the glass hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And somebody here will definitely show you
how to tell between going into a
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary and talking to some chick that
has big tits and has no education on what
[SPEAKER_05]: strain does what or this or that.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's just there because she's like,
oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, that falls up to
management, you know, and they're right to
[SPEAKER_06]: that regard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say I love the springs that there
are a lot of places here that have good,
[SPEAKER_06]: educated bartenders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't you go into a club like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different way more education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also another issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you get you get a 21 year old
kid, you know, would you rather him go to
[SPEAKER_02]: a bar where a bartender can sit there and
monitor him and then cut him off when he's
[SPEAKER_02]: had enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you rather him go to a liquor
store and go home with a bottle of vodka
[SPEAKER_02]: and get himself stupid drunk and end up
destroying something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or getting behind the wheel and destroying
somebody?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather him be at a cannabis club,
not drinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he were my son sitting on the couch,
intellectual conversation, listening to
[SPEAKER_04]: laid back music.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst thing that's going to happen is
they might fall asleep on the couch and
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that does happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see people do that at these clubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Members might not offer whatever the case
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of these club owners wake them up
rudely to leave or, you know, it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: about a turnkey spot thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they rest there comfortably till
they're comfortable enough to wake up and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they make sure they're OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're hydrated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every club I've been to has literally had
that mentality.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I point that out to people because
people don't know and they assume that it
[SPEAKER_06]: runs like something that's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to take huge dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes when I take a giant dab here
before I can blow it all the way out,
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody's got a bottle of water in my
face like you're going to need this,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: People look out for each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never have to cough more than once or
twice before someone's got water for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're free.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, if you're thirsty and need a
couch and a dab, it's a great spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mixture of people is always great
here, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got dreadlocks down to my butt and I'm
sitting next to a veteran.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The community here is unmatched.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two dreads, some veterans, a guy from
Miami, our new friend over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is honestly, I've done several
podcasts away from my home studio and this
[SPEAKER_04]: is my favorite that I've done on another
couch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The podcast here was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my favorite folks, some of my new
favorite friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the listeners, when it comes time,
let's be proactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time, if you're in Colorado and you
do not have rules on social clubs,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's time for you or your nerdy friend
that's involved in the politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in every group.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always that one guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, that's you in Pueblo, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get you guys together and start making
rules for social smoke clubs in your city
[SPEAKER_04]: before they get banned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be proactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly the steps on how to
do that, but one of your friends does,
[SPEAKER_04]: knows how to create an initiative,
knows how to get a petition started.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know how to get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably you in your group,
right, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Veterans for Natural Rights basically
exists to push policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We defend all kinds of natural individual
rights such as the right to medicate
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself the way you please, also veterans
rights, any other individual right that
[SPEAKER_02]: has to do with freedom and liberty.
[SPEAKER_06]: The right to safe access medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Safe access of medicine is the primary one
that we lobby on here in Colorado because
[SPEAKER_02]: it is such a big issue here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's forming and it's the Wild West.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being crafted right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're setting policy in everyone's eyes
are on us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for standing up for it with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud to do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now also, if you are in a state that has
not gone legal with cannabis yet,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're writing the rules to create
medical and or recreational cannabis in
[SPEAKER_04]: your state, be sure to include these
social clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure they can be open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure that they exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure they're regulated in a fair way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend that you make it to where
these places have a grow, to where these
[SPEAKER_04]: social clubs have a grow attached to them
that can provide the product to this place
[SPEAKER_04]: would be ideal in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least a private grower that has like
an overabundance and they want to offload
[SPEAKER_05]: their extra.
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we should be able to stimulate and
stabilize the economy in every shape and
[SPEAKER_05]: way and manner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it only makes sense to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by blocking that, we're just blocking
really good medical medicine that
[SPEAKER_05]: otherwise could be shared all over the
city.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many potholes did you guys hit on the
way over here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a new one every six months in
Colorado Springs because of the potholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could kind of do proper things with
the tax money, generate proper tax revenue
[SPEAKER_04]: through places like this, we could fix
some of the damn potholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every last pothole could be filled with
pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill those potholes with pot money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a shout out to Rhode
Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was told that in Rhode Island,
the dispensaries are going to open without
[SPEAKER_04]: grows attached and the grows will be done
by guys like you and I that know how to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can take it to the dispensaries and
legally sell it to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look out for Fox Jackson, Rhode Island
next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how they do it in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got in the game here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, somewhat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get it tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do three sheets of paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get it tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you can go and just sell it at any
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's only fair.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little known fact that every last grower,
the top-notch growers in Colorado they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're independent guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're independent guys who are running
their own grows and they're growing the
[SPEAKER_02]: best medicine in the entire state,
in the entire country, in the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the best growers I know are
independent growers or breeders or not
[SPEAKER_06]: working for... Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that are in for the love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's very rare.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff, you're the first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run a small grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a very small grow that I breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I breed a lot and mostly I'm trying to
bring that quality to this large facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running the Green and Healthy Wellness
Grow now.
[SPEAKER_04]: 85 flowering lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see why the quality falls off a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of stuff to manage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole new environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just throw up a 14,000 BTU air
conditioner, a couple of blowers,
[SPEAKER_04]: a fan and then go and pull off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to put in tons of air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have ducting for days.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are miles of PVC tubing in that
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use one room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses a thousand gallons of water a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I mix one of those tanks off of it,
imagine the amounts of nutrients I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: mixing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's 1,750 milliliters of one nutrient
that goes in there and I'm using five or
[SPEAKER_04]: six different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I mess one of those up, imagine the
catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're trying to bring that level of
quality to that playing field.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a true challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people don't take any of
those things into account.
[SPEAKER_06]: We brought that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's definitely the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see why the small boutique grows are
preferred and beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to get this stuff going on in a
big facility like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're doing most of it solo,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take probably 78% credit for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the first run at the new grow,
the ladies helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Damsel and Haley.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did give me a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_04]: John Hunt is in there as often as he can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have a crew of a few dudes that
come occasionally and do if I need things
[SPEAKER_04]: that I just can't handle by myself,
they do de-leafing.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can take like 75%, 80% credit for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Hunt runs a lot of the bedroom for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to have an owner that's
involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to have Hunt there and involved
in helping me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I touch every single plant every
single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are my ladies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta love your babies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the first one in, last one out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I open and close the gate every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love what you do there, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep supporting.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get to dab the Black Cherry Kim
live resin?
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably going to take another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of my favorite podcasts I've
ever done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank everybody for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to get everybody back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fox, you and I want to do a show here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get a live audience maybe
so we can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need to get with Camille and your
co-owner and set a date and we'll get that
[SPEAKER_04]: show going.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be super fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to get, what's the maximum
capacity here?
[SPEAKER_00]: 49.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to try to get 49 people in
this bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll invite people on Facebook and we'll
do Instagram invites and we'll tell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could do that.
That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll sit here in these couches and we'll
talk about CBD for a little bit and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll let anybody in the audience that has
a question grab a microphone and ask
[SPEAKER_04]: questions and you and I can answer grow
questions and CBD questions live on the
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd appreciate the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a bunch of stuff to give away
that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, everybody for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camille, thanks for letting us do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to do it again sometime.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get you on another show with
Maddie and possibly Carly and we're going

industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we're talking about badass ladies in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Jessica.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's one of the best cannabis ladies
ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many cannabis ladies we could
hire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I say bitches?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the badass bitches out
there that are just doing their thing of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and that are educated on what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just out there shaking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to girls who make cash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brittany Wagner, I think he's talking to
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anybody got any final words while you
got a microphone in your hand and people
[SPEAKER_04]: are listening?

Yes, it was.
