[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everyone, it's Three Tokes and you're
tuned in to the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for a fresh episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find
them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, roll up a fat spliff
[SPEAKER_00]: and bust out a pen and paper because it's
time for a fresh episode of the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick intro today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot planned for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the episodes off
by letting you know what I'm smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of memberberry nectar from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Memberberry is from our friends at the
Ethos Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Memberberry is skunkberry crossed to the
mandarin sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The description on the package says it
will taste like cheese, smarties,
[SPEAKER_00]: candies, orange peel and overwhelming
fruit punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would have to agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you open the concentrate
container, a smell of cheese hits you
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a sharp cheddar comes
right out of the package right into your
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the sharp cheddar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you lean in and you smell more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when the candy flavor kind of
comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that smarties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a fruit punch flavor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you dab it, that's when the
smarties, candies, the overwhelming fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: punch takes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the exhale, that orange
peel kind of kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really complex flavored
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gram is not going to last long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to smoke this shit out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, ladies and gentlemen, I'm smoking on
the memberberry nectar from Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of information to pack into
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move right into the Grow Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of my listeners are ready
for a deep dive into some grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it and let's talk
about enzymes in growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into this, I do need to give
some credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always shout out to GreenCultureMagazine
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give my brain a refresher in
enzymes before I recorded a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typed in growing with enzymes on my
Google browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first article that came up was
GreenCultureMagazine.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly went through several articles
and this article explained it the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most thorough, accurate, simplest,
understandable description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I borrowed a lot of the information
from this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't accuse me of stealing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GreenCultureMagazine.com is where the
bulk of this information was updated from
[SPEAKER_00]: in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is my footnote to start the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is an enzyme?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't worry if I lose you here in the
beginning because eventually this will all
[SPEAKER_00]: click and I promise it will make sense by
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is an enzyme?
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are proteins made of complex
chains of amino acids folded into shapes
[SPEAKER_00]: that resemble a Pac-Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that doesn't mean a lot to a lot of
us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complex chain of amino acids and
it's shaped like Pac-Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that Pac-Man idea triggers ideas in
my head really quickly on how to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are in your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the soil eating the bad shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Pac-Maning up all the dead roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Pac-Maning up all the things we
don't want in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes are eating that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically just in there eating the
ghosts and the dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what these Pac-Man shaped proteins
are in there doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk a little bit more about
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes help break things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also speed up the breakdown process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes can also modify and create other
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes occur naturally and are necessary
to all life forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without enzymes, life as we know it
probably could not exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, bacteria, microbes and fungus
excrete enzymes that live in symbiosis
[SPEAKER_00]: with other living things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until recently, scientists could not
create enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could only harvest them from living
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about some actual uses
of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common commercial uses of enzymes
other than alcohol production,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need enzymes to create alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are heavily used in the alcohol
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other common uses, enzymes were
heavily used for making laundry and dish
[SPEAKER_00]: detergents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes would get in there and help
break down the old food or the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter or whatever is stained on your
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes will wipe that food right off
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got some dirty clothes,
the enzymes will get in there and break
[SPEAKER_00]: down that dirt and that funk and get that
shit right out of your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enzymes were used in making laundry and
dish detergents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are also used in septic tanks to
help break down the waste even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you live in the mountains,
and you don't have plumbing, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet hooked up to some piping that goes
to a big tank that's buried underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically when you flush the toilet,
all your poop goes into this big tank and
[SPEAKER_00]: it sits in this tank underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does decompose over time,
but they fill it with very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes and those enzymes eat your poop
and it dissolves that poop right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't get an overflow from your
septic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the sort of stuff that enzymes
are good for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen enzymes sold as supplements in
health food stores to aid in digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer, the most common that I've seen
is a papaya enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in a tube, or not a tube,
but a roll that looks similar to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Tums or an antacid of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got that foil thing around it and
you unwrap it and you break one out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there and you chew on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't taste too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of chalky, kind of powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were mango and papaya were
the flavor that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You chew on those and the enzymes that are
in there are supposed to aid in food
[SPEAKER_00]: digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you digest your food more
smoothly, more quickly, and it also is
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to help you uptake your nutrients
more thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't notice anything when I ate it,
but I worked at the health food store and
[SPEAKER_00]: there were samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is another use for enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like now we are becoming
more familiar with an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the enzyme actually is and we
understand a few practical applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shouldn't sound so foreign to us at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more about
enzymes in cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are very limited on function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is a cellulose enzyme
can only break down cellulose and nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need specific enzymes to do certain
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now an enzyme can repeat its function
millions of times, but it can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: deactivated or destroyed by other enzymes,
by pH swings, by temperature, or by a
[SPEAKER_00]: myriad of other options that could happen
in a grow enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are fairly stable, but they are
also slightly delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about why we use enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we buying enzymatic products to
add to our feeding solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes aid in simple tasks like getting
rid of dead roots or more complex tasks
[SPEAKER_00]: like accelerating plant growth and
assisting in hormone biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common reason for adding enzymes
to a high-performance garden is to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the medium clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I talked earlier about using enzymes
in our septic tank, and I talked earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: about using enzymes in laundry detergent,
and then I also talked about using enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: as a dietary supplement to help people
digest food and absorb nutrients better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you think about all those uses,
we can kind of see how that would transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: to our cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the enzymes are helping people digest
food and absorb nutrients better,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably going to happen to our
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's think about that septic tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes are in there breaking up the
poop, breaking up the dead stuff that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when your plants are growing,
some of the roots are going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have decomposing matter in
your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those enzymes are going to get in there
and eat that stuff up and turn it into
[SPEAKER_00]: usable fuel before it's able to become a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a vector for problems,
pathogens and disease, when you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something decaying in your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these enzymes will get in there and
they'll go, hey, look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, and they'll chew
it up and they'll turn it into plant
[SPEAKER_00]: energy for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the same thing with the laundry
detergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting in there and breaking things
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cleaning it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get in there and break
things down and clean up your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in short terms, these enzymes are
getting in there and acting like those
[SPEAKER_00]: scrubbing bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the old commercials with the
scrubbing bubbles?
[SPEAKER_00]: That scrubbing bubbles in Pac-Man,
getting in there and eating the ghosts,
[SPEAKER_00]: eating the dots, scrubbing the bubbles,
getting the dead poop out, getting those
[SPEAKER_00]: dead roots out, and keeping your roots in
your root zone healthy and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enzymes kind of act as a protectant,
maybe a security guard of sorts against
[SPEAKER_00]: disease and pathogens within the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're acting like those scrubbing
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in there scrubbing the problems
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe those dead roots are ghosts and
little pathogens and disease are the
[SPEAKER_00]: little dots and they're just Pac-Man and
the shit out of those little things in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just miss Pac-Man and Pac-Man just in
there living their Pac-Man midway life,
[SPEAKER_00]: just chasing those ghosts around.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get back on track,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned that specific enzymes
can only perform specific functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some enzyme products break down dead
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some enzyme products break down bad
bacterias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some enzyme products help improve soil
health by breaking down dead material into
[SPEAKER_00]: useful sugars and minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do I know which enzymes I need and
which enzymes I'm getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Each company has their own proprietary
blend of enzymes that they put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about a test in a few
minutes on ways we can tell if there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of enzymes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, unless you can do these
tests, we've just got to trust these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll talk more about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, enzymes act as an
accelerator for chemical reactions that
[SPEAKER_00]: are produced in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that by breaking down or
speeding up the breakdown process of dead
[SPEAKER_00]: root matter, of bad bacteria, of things
that are unwelcome and unwanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they turn that into usable sugars and
minerals for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in there turning funk into food
for you is basically what your enzymes are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most of your commercially available
bottle nutrients are going to be made
[SPEAKER_00]: through fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ferment vegetables, which creates a
trichoderma, which allows the enzymes to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep that production happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they collect the enzymes into a
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sell it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then they sell it to a distributor
who sells it to a grow store who then
[SPEAKER_00]: sells it to us after it's been shipped
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to know if the enzymes in
that bottle are even alive by the time it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to know what's even in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make your own enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make enzymes with a Bokashi
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about the Bokashi bucket
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that leachate stuff that comes
out, that juice, that terrible smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: vomit poop-smelled juice that comes out,
that is loaded with enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good portion of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a clogged drain, the enzymes
in that Bokashi bucket will dissolve a
[SPEAKER_00]: funky clog in your drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells you about the enzymes that
are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use that in your
plants, use it very sparingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very little bit per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put maybe an ounce in a 25 gallon
container of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can make your own enzymes through
the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just as effective and they're
basically free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually, I think you're
making money doing that because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting food scraps that would have gone
into the trash, into the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're making money because you're
not putting something into the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reusing a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're turning it into something that
you're going to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you and your plants are eating the
same diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you think a little more
about it and it's going to make you take
[SPEAKER_00]: better care of yourself and your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will encourage your dietary
decisions when you're shopping because
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll go to buy something and you'll say,
oh, I can't put that in the Bokashi
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll start eating more raw,
healthy foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start loving the plants and
realizing what goes into these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you say, why do I spend all the money on
the best nutrients but then I stop at
[SPEAKER_00]: McDonald's and feed myself shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start feeding yourself the
top shelf nutrients also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me figure out where I was in this
rant and we will get back on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own enzymes with the
Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with the Bokashi
bucket, it's really easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some simple research on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will change your growing life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another very good use of bottled
enzymes is if you are going to recycle
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa or if you're going to recycle your
soil, I highly recommend you mix up some
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that cocoa or that dirt is still
in the pots, let's say you've harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, you've got that little nub of
a stick sticking out, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry those pots off to wherever and then
that soil is going to get recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a container to dump all
of that soil into, while it's still in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room, run a strong feed of water and
just enzymes through those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up, if it says two mils per gallon,
do four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put four mils in there and just water
those plants till you get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a pot with dirt in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those enzymes are going to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on recycling that soil or
recycling that cocoa, that's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and break down all the dead shit,
all the leftover shit that you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to clean that stuff right out
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to combine it all together
into a giant container, if you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, stir it up, get it all combined,
then run the enzyme water through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that, but that's going to be a much
larger container of water to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a much larger mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably used to watering nine or
10 three or five gallon pots already,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's probably easier for you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to recycle your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned that we were going to
talk about a test to determine which
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes are actually contained within the
bottles that we are purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about any branding
because that is up to you to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping, do your research, just buy
quality enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who to recommend right now
because I'm making mine with the Bokashi
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several brands out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're getting anything
extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy those really expensive
brands, they may be selling you the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing as the lesser costing brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's in there, but we're
going to talk about a test to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: what is in our enzyme bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This test will tell us if the enzymes we
purchased are able to break down cellulose
[SPEAKER_00]: and hemicellulose, which are two
components of root material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first test, pour some of your enzymes
into a small dish and simply drop a small
[SPEAKER_00]: square of paper into that dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes have to cover and coat this
little piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that happens, if the paper is
destroyed and eaten up by the enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is proof positive that there are
enzymes in there that are able to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second test will be done to determine
the presence of hemicellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be saying that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm saying hemicellulose wrong,
please do correct me so that I can sound
[SPEAKER_00]: smart in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some applesauce and pour some of that
enzyme product right into the applesauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pour it into the whole jar,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little dish, just a little container
of applesauce and pour some of your enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: product into the applesauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if the applesauce becomes liquidy,
if it eats up the chunks of apple and just
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it a liquid, you can see that there
are enzymes in there that are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: break up hemicellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can visually assess that those enzymes
are there and working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this may not work with all products
and if it doesn't work, it does not mean
[SPEAKER_00]: there are not enzymes in your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that cellulose and
hemicellulose are not present or active in
[SPEAKER_00]: the product which you purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we talked about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many different kinds of enzymes
and each has its own specific function or
[SPEAKER_00]: a specific target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also know that plants create their
own enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if the brand of enzymes you're
purchasing doesn't contain a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme, don't be afraid to get another
product, an enzymatic product,
[SPEAKER_00]: and back it up with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can overdose these
plants with enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll all balance each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll all be used for something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one isn't needed, another enzyme will
probably destroy it and turn it into
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is needed for the plants at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, some products that are sold as enzymes
are not even enzymes, but they're blends
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbes and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they work properly, they will
populate and secrete the enzymes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's only possible if the microbes
are still alive and they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough to be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's it for this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got a problem or if you'd
like to make some improvements,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at your garden through a
FaceTime conversation, through a Skype
[SPEAKER_00]: call, through a Google Hangout call,
some way where I can see what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can show me your plants and we
can talk about how to improve your setup
[SPEAKER_00]: and or situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what else to offer as my
Patreon rewards or my gifts or my returns,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you'd like to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's something you'd like to
request, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: simply go to Patreon and send me a message
through that service and I will get back
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need your outgoing voicemail
greeting recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's Rasta Jeff and you just reached
Bobby and he can't come to the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe somebody you really love or care
for has a birthday coming up and they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of the podcast or a fan of
iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could get them like a video
birthday card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could record them a message,
be like, yo, what's up, Billy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it's your birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me and take a dab and blow some smoke at
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could do something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to accommodate your needs and
put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I think that's
all I've got for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was a short episode,
but I think it was packed with enough
[SPEAKER_00]: information to make it worth putting out
this short episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get started on a whole new
topic right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain and mouth are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a few days with a fresh
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge thank you shout out
to my friend Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
