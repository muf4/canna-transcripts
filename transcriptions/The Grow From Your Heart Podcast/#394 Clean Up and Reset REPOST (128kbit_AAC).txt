[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 394 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by Oregon
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need fresh seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at OregonEliteSeeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a tradition that we start the
podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of vanilla cookies
batter from Apothecary Farms, and it
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let the nail cool nice and cool,
you get the real nice vanilla cream kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a savage and you hit it while
the nail's a little bit hot, you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: spicy Durban poison part of the Girl Scout
Cookies flavor, and I really love both
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors, and it really gives me a great
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really enjoy the vanilla cookies from
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all three locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a Pueblo location,
they've got a Colorado Springs location,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the time this comes out,
they will have opened a Denver location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up and congratulations to all of my
friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
another repost episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the timeline of those grow lessons,
it has become time to clean up and reset
[SPEAKER_00]: our garden for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I originally did this episode as number
327.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reposting it now as 392.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's clean up and reset our garden
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by my friends at the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 328 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm smoking Stardog Ambrosia Batter
from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me, you know I love the
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the aroma, I love the flavor,
I love the high, I love the way it grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, I love taking pictures of
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a very photogenic strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia
Batter from our friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've been following the show
lately, you've probably caught the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes about determining ripeness of
your cannabis plants, then we did an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode about flushing your plants,
then we did an episode about harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we did an episode about drying and
curing your cannabis plants, then we did
[SPEAKER_00]: an episode about trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it is time to clean up the grow room
and get restarted for the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about after
harvest cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds pretty basic, but there are a
few things you may overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you had bugs or powdery mildew,
you may want to step up your cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to step up your cleaning
regimen, but if you didn't have any bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: or any issues, I think a light bleach and
water solution should work, or maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to get yourself some Fizan and
use 15 to 20 mils of Fizan per gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that to clean up your whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, whatever product you use,
let's clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wipe down every inch of every wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at one section at the top and just
work your way down and to the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just keep going until you've
covered every inch of that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you can reach, scrub the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't reach, find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can probably reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, get a ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrub the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean it with either bleach and hot
water or Fizan and hot water and just get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything off of there that may be hiding
that we don't want in that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a spider mite up there
chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a little bit of powdery
mildew spore that you don't know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a piece of pollen up there
that you don't know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean everything just to be sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your light reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of the lights, they're probably
dusty up on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflectors, they're dusty on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this opportunity while the room's
empty and clean everything, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take the light reflectors down if you
think they need some cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang them back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the fans off of the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the little grate off the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unscrew the little thing that holds the
blades on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the blades off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans get disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grate on the back is filled with muck
and hair and just weird random gunk that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't even tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that shit out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to be disgusted that
you've been blowing that shit around in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're cleaning the fans,
look at anything that moves air or blows
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the air return on your
dehumidifier that things pulling in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of water and a bunch of air and then
it's blowing air back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that filter need to be changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that dehumidifier need to be cleaned
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the water line that's draining water
out of your dehumidifier, is it gunky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it need to be cleaned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the reservoir that you're draining your
dehumidifier water into starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop slime and algae?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you need to clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay on top of those sort of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dust everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of everything is dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of everything is funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been spraying pesticides in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you sprayed some sticky pesticide
like Asimax in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it got dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sticking to the Asimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wipe it and dust the tops of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your hydro tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got tables in the room,
clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got trays and you can take them
outside, take them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them down with the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a power washer, hit them
with the power washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those tables are real dirty,
scrub them down with some Fizan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrub them down with some bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you rinse them out real good and
just get them real clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the Fizan is going to foam up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make foam with Fizan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure you clean everything out
when you're done using cleaning products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean out your tables and reservoirs
really well if you use a cleaning product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse the shit out of those hydro tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse the shit out of all your tubing and
all of your lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that stuff so that it's not clogged
and so there's no algae in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something people don't pay enough
attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just walk on the floor all day,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some sort of poly film or
panda film on the floor, some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: subfloor, does it need to be replaced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there holes in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has your poly or your panda film started
stretching and getting holes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: staples?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to duct tape some spots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that kind of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything lands on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floor is gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got light reflectors with glass
on them so that they're air-cooled,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that glass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wipe that shit down with some Windex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry and put it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the reflector glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, clean all of your air conditioner
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got ducting anywhere,
check your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the ducting isn't bent in any
weird places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there are no clogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure all of your duct is secured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's duct taped or clamped
somewhere so that the air you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: move away from the grow doesn't
accidentally end up being blown right
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a leak, that air is just
going to come flying out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just be moving the heat from the
light right back into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your air conditioner has to work
harder and you can't figure out why the
[SPEAKER_00]: room isn't cooling down and it gets
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check all of your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that carbon filter still filtering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you smell the herb outside when you
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did anybody mention that your harvest
stunk really badly?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you had that carbon filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you write it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should know when that carbon filter
needs to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the brands say they will last two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never believe in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a carbon filter last two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that carbon filter cover,
maybe you're going to leave that filter
[SPEAKER_00]: there for two years and it's got that
little dust cover on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that ugly thing off, throw it in the
washer with some OxyClean and clean that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to see your pictures of your
black and gray carbon filter dust cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys, get in there and clean out
the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a reservoir that you mix
your nutrients in or that you use as part
[SPEAKER_00]: of your hydro system that you're pumping
your nutrients from right to your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you want to clean fresh
start?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want biofilm and funk in there
because that's going directly to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, clean all of the tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already said that once, but clean it
all because all that gunk will end up into
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we should remember to clean
is the emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a hydro system with some
sprayers or emitters or sprinklers at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of a line, make sure you pop those
emitters off and clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to get filled with some gunky
funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the perfect opportunity to take all
those off and clean them up real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another really important thing we can do
while we've got the room taken down,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can decide if we need to replace any
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have your bulbs been in the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what type of lighting you're
using, it may be time to swap out some
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When bulbs get old, they still draw the
same amount of electricity, but they do
[SPEAKER_00]: not put out the same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're paying for that electricity and
it is not making it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check your bulbs and see if they need
to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good way to find out if they need to be
replaced is to get a lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lumen meter will measure how much light
is coming from your bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your bulb is putting out less than 75
or 80% of its maximum output, it is time
[SPEAKER_00]: to replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you know what the maximum
output of that bulb is?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to find that out is to buy a brand
new bulb, put the bulb in your reflector,
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to wait a few minutes and
let that bulb get to its maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: brightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little while for the bulbs to
heat up and get to the right spectrum and
[SPEAKER_00]: get all the way bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's bright and all the way heated
up, go about 12 to 18 inches from that
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb and measure what the lumens are right
there and write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the date and the amount of
lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then check it now when you're cleaning the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go the same distance away with that lumen
meter and see how many lumens are popping
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not satisfied with the amount of
power you're getting out of that bulb,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is time to replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're paying for
electricity that is not making it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, it is time to replace your bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lumen meters may be expensive,
but a lot of times the grow shop will let
[SPEAKER_00]: you borrow one because they know that if
your bulbs are bad, you're probably just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come buy more bulbs when you
return the lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask them at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have one available that you can
borrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, most of the cleaning
stuff should be fairly obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the shit out of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrub everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put plants in anything
that had a cleaner in it, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: get that cleaner out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replace the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replace the filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other things we may not remember to
think about are check and reset your
[SPEAKER_00]: timers and all of your programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your lights on a certain
schedule, fix that schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your CO2 or your auto
watering on a schedule, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: correct that schedule before you put new
plants in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did daylight savings time happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the timer on the right time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your timer on the right day?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the controllers have a day that
you can set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the proper day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have AM and PM set properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out all of your
controllers before you put plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and you accidentally flower them way too
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, check out all of your CO2 controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I like to do at this point
in time is calibrate all of my pens and
[SPEAKER_00]: meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to calibrate my pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make sure that my EC meter is
working properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things that you should check
on between harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to calibrate my meters about once
every two weeks, to tell you the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably every 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to check on them and make sure
that those things are accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, you should have a fire
extinguisher near your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the little gauge on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's in the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your fire extinguisher gauge is not in
the green, either buy a new one or take it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the fire department and have it
refilled correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you don't have to use that
fire extinguisher, but if you need it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want it to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, check the batteries in your smoke
alarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I said smoke alarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow should have a smoke alarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to burn down the house
because something went wrong in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room and you did not have a smoke detector
and a fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be a responsible grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that the safety precautions are
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we're checking on the fire
extinguisher and the smoke alarm,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a good time to check on your
respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using a respirator to apply
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope you're using something to
keep yourself safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a respirator, now is the
time to check those cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have they been on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time to replace them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that respirator clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's time to watch a Google video
and learn how to properly clean and take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of your respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is going to save your life over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's a good time to replace your
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need more nitrile gloves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need more Tyvek suits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a really good time to make a list
and go to the grow store and stock up on
[SPEAKER_00]: those types of items.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got the grow room nice
and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've checked all of our safety
precautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've refilled all of the necessary
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to do a quick inventory
of your pesticides and nutrients and any
[SPEAKER_00]: accessories you think you may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to need pesticides or
nutrients, start ordering that stuff now
[SPEAKER_00]: so that when you move your plants back
into the room, you have got all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and all of the supplies you need
so that you don't miss a day of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got everything cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've checked out all of our safety
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've restocked all of our personal
protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reordered all of our nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we didn't have any problems with
pests or powder emildue, it is time to
[SPEAKER_00]: start running that room and get it
prepared for the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you did have pests or problems,
there are a couple of more steps that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to clean this room thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to spray it with some products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might want to go a little harder with
the bleach water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might want to go a little harder with
some Fizan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to get a product called
Procure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had powder emildue, you're going to
want to spray something to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spores in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had bugs, I would recommend
spraying some sort of pesticide through
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mix up your pesticide sprayer,
your pump sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have one, go get one from
Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a deck sprayer that can handle bleach
because you're going to be putting some
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need one that holds about a
gallon, maybe two gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it up with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your cleaning product in there,
whether it's Fizan, whether it's Procure,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a bunch of bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to use granulated sulfur if
you had a PM issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray the shit out of the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your best opportunity to spray
everything and eliminate your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no plants in there, so you can
use products that you wouldn't spray when
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and clean the shit out of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start with the normal cleaning I
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take everything down and clean it,
then put it back up, then set up the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you put the plants in there,
go in there with this extra hard commando
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go really hard, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get all of the bugs out of
there or you're just going to bring plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and they're going to get bugs or
they're going to get PM and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have another struggling harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody likes to struggle through a
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've taken everything apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've cleaned the shit out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've replaced the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've replaced all of our filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have calibrated all of our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got new protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tested our safety equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put the room back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone in there and done another final
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we hit it with Fizan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we sprayed Procure on everything to
try to get rid of our problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we just sprayed bleach water,
real hot bleach water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we went in there with some H2O2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would work really well also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you use any type of products like
that, you guys make sure you wear personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment, some goggles,
and a respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray H2O2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray Fizan without some
sort of protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit will be terrible for your eyes,
terrible for your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're using a sprayer to spray
anything, please use some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory protection, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once the room is put back together,
here is something I suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would turn on the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would turn on your blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would turn on the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would turn on the air conditioner,
and I would let everything run for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, and I would stand in the room and
pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you could dial in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you could adjust?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it while you're in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, go outside and walk around your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your grow is at your house,
just go walk around the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go pick up trash around the house or
whatever and see if you can identify any
[SPEAKER_00]: light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see light coming out of your grow
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see light coming out, there is
light going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want and cannot have light leaks
in our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, walk around the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk around the perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify any possible light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear the blowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear the fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hear your air conditioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anything outside making it obvious that
you're running a grow in that house?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good time to discover that we've
got light leaks or that we've got noisy
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment so that we don't get ourselves
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to attract law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be legal where you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is legal where I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still stealth because you know who's
worse than law enforcement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want people to know you've got
to grow in your house because somebody may
[SPEAKER_00]: come and take your crop from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be careful even in a legal
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your grow stealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, walk around outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, listen, smell, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if anything is going wrong outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're sure that everything is fine
outside, that's when you can go back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow room, turn off the lights in the
grow room, and stand in there for about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your eyes adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to find out if any light
is leaking into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to find out if the
sunshine from outside is coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: your ducts for your vented hoods right
into your light reflectors into your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room and shining light on your plants
during a dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to find that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the catch to these last two things,
you're only going to be able to tell if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a light leak outside if you go
walk around the house and it's dark
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you can tell if you have a
light leak inside is if it's light outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and you go in the grow room and you turn
off the lights on the inside of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're going to have to find the time
of day to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do some
investigating and some inspecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are very important details to
not overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your grow room is lightproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there's not a lot of noise
coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, find out if you've got too much
aroma and correct it if you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to attract attention that
you don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've been growing for a while or if
you're somebody who is looking for grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: so say myself, I've been growing for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I used to go walk my dog in my
neighborhood, I would always discover a
[SPEAKER_00]: new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go a different route.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go two blocks that way, three blocks
that way, a block that way, and then I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and then the next day I'd just
do a different pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always find a new grow about once
a week because I know what I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: or listening for and smelling for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the clues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I hear your weird blower at three in
the morning going, from your basement
[SPEAKER_00]: window, chances are you got to grow in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an air conditioner in your
basement window in the middle of winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: chances are there's a grow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one window by the basement
that has no snow and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard is snowy, there's a grow in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one spot on your roof above one
bedroom that there's no snow on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a grow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are really easy signs that give it
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention, you guys, because if I
can see it, law enforcement can see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so can the thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to stay stealth, even in, leave it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to set bait.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is a pretty good clean
and reset episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I mentioned some details that
you would have overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I rescued you through a couple
of pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't have to make those mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully everything was well in your grow
and you don't have any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you don't have anything funky to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, now that the grow is nice and clean,
let's fucking keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get in there with a mop and a broom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day if we need to, and mop and sweep
that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get in there with a shop vac and
suck out, you know that shit in the corner
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the fucking shop vac and back that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna shop vac itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great place for a spider mite
to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great place for some aphids to
hang out and breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great place for some powdery
mildew to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a vector for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that you've got it nice and clean,
don't be lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and clean it as often as you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that cleanliness is godliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that most applies in kitchens
and grow rooms, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean up that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself a nice, clean environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your plants a nice, healthy start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your plants will be more
comfortable and I think you will also
[SPEAKER_00]: notice working in a cleaner, more
organized environment will make you
[SPEAKER_00]: happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you faster and more productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shit, now that you're done cleaning up
the grow room, why don't you clean up all
[SPEAKER_00]: your supplies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go organize your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go organize the pesticides, the measuring
devices, your cleaning supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go write down a list of anything that you
can need, anything that you're low on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get yourself organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, get a notebook and start making
detailed notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start documenting when you changed your
bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start documenting when you changed your
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start documenting the last time you
changed your air conditioner filters and
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated your meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start writing that stuff down so that when
something comes up, you can look in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and go, oh, that's why my pH meter isn't
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't calibrated the fucking thing in
two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find some things you were slipping
on if you start taking more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast ruled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that pretty much wraps up my
clean and reset the grow room episode.
