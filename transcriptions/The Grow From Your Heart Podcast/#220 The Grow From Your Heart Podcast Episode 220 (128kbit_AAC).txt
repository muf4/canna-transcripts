[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks a lot for the sweet comment,
Fat Ankle Foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that Soma inspired you and
started a lot of your teachings because
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned a lot from Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of use some of Soma's methods,
but mostly his ideals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He almost treats plants as like a
religion, sort of.
[SPEAKER_01]: His religion is growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took that spiritual aspect of
growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that before I ever knew about Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of, I multiplied on it or
expanded on it once I found Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you knew Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're a Soma fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, thanks for using worms in your
garden and thanks for trying to go organic
[SPEAKER_01]: and thanks for listening and super thanks
for the comment and the five stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're part of the crew now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to the crew, Fat Ankle Foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I read this comment on the last
episode, but this one is from Buzzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thanks for making this for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, dude, you're super welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want to send us a comment,
I'd love to read your comments on a future

[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can let me know if you want your name
said or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't always tell everybody that you
grow cannabis if you don't live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feels like enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a solo episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk a little bit about the
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company was kind
enough to give me a tour of the worm farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to talk a little bit about
my company, iRegenetics, and I'll also
[SPEAKER_01]: talk a little bit about Feminize Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a lot of emails about Feminize
Seeds, so I'll explain my method of making
[SPEAKER_01]: those a little later in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's start with the Rocky Mountain
Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, I was invited to go visit the
Rocky Mountain Worm Company and they gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me a little tour of the building and I got
to see where the worm castings are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a giant facility,
but what they do have is super clean and
[SPEAKER_01]: super organized and I was pretty
impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to hang out with Jay and Sean and
Alan for a few minutes and they taught me
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot about worms and worm castings and
why they use specific worms that they use
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some worms you guys only eat the top layer
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put them in a big thing of dirt,
like if it's a field of dirt or if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a bucket full of dirt, they will only
eat the top layer and they don't dig down.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys actually know which worms eat
the top, which worms eat the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that some worms will eat every
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some worms will travel through all of the
dirt or whatever you're putting them in
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will eat and digest all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys knew a lot about their worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed me worms in every single stage
of growth, every single stage of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of keep the worms in five gallon
buckets and they let me open the buckets
[SPEAKER_01]: with the worm farms in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to feel the texture of the medium in
which the worms live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of airy, it's kind of fluffy,
it feels a lot like the soil that I mix
[SPEAKER_01]: for my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I thought was really cool
is what they're feeding the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really cool in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parts of the worm diet is dried and ground
herb from a company called Openvape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Openvape makes vapor pen cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're extracting the CBD or THC from a
plant and making oil out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they send all the leftover material
to the worm company to feed the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worm company is using ground up plant
stalks and leaves and whatever else was
[SPEAKER_01]: left of the plants after harvest,
after the making oil part happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're feeding the ground up plant matter
back to the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the worms are making castings out of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those castings are being used to grow my
cannabis and probably those worm castings
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully make it back to Openvape and go
back into their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of doing an in-house recycling
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes full circle without us creating
more stuff, without something being tossed
[SPEAKER_01]: into a dumpster for the trash guy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine when you harvest, you have every
plant has a stalk and stems and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you let that dry, grind it up
and had some worms to feed that to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't have to throw all that away
and you wouldn't have to make so many
[SPEAKER_01]: trips to the dump or wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just super efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was completely impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to Jay and
Sean and Alan and Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like hanging out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worm factory is a cool place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely be back there soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys threw a handful of products my
way and I'm kind of starting to implement
[SPEAKER_01]: them in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to slowly adjust from the
non-organic bottled stuff to the organics
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't want to ruin the organic
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning what I can switch out and
what I can use together.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are definitely moving me along
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been feeding my plants worm castings
for about a month now and I can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: see an improvement in my crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I noticed, I would say
that after introducing worm castings,
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow kashi, is that my plants are just
simply more active.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're greener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see more growth and they also seem to
want more water, which tells me they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and taking nutrients more than
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely encourage the use of grow
kashi and worm castings as a nice way to
[SPEAKER_01]: just start leaning toward the organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've been talking about them
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to learn more about the worm
company, I definitely recommend you check
[SPEAKER_01]: out their online presence is www
.rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also on Instagram at Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you will learn a lot from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can stop by their store,
check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them I sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that at the beginning, but go
there, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, big, huge shout out to the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't get enough of that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I want to talk about is
irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a couple of emails every week about
irie genetics with questions about irie
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody just asked me why I don't
talk about irie genetics on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show isn't really about irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show is about cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I try not to focus too much on my own
company, but it seems like you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess it seems fair that I talk
about it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to toot my own horn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a sip here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's talk about irie genetics,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irie genetics is of course my seed
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed regular and feminized cannabis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, irie genetics is pretty much
sold out of seeds for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature's Green Remedies is my main
distributor and they got most of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: had leftover after I hooked up most of my
local friends with my latest harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to get the locals,
all my friends, all my Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my company is called irie genetics
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is what allowed me to become this
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the local people should get
the irie genetics products first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way I get to see what they grow
and I get to take pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm not trying to be rude about it,
but the locals always get served up first.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I feel like everybody's gotten their
seeds, I make sure Nature's Green Remedies
[SPEAKER_01]: gets what they can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I really can't make enough seeds to
meet the demand lately, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make more golden goat and
lemon Jeffrey seeds here really soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boys for that project are actually in
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make fem seeds or seeds in
general, you got to start the boys off a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit ahead of the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the males are in flower now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The girls will go on flower in a couple of
few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those should be ready in about 90 days
from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this episode will come out March
1st or 2nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 90 days from then, I should have lemon
Jeffrey and golden goat seeds available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually wrote down the wrong strain and
I almost said the wrong strain and teased
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I'm making more lemon Jeffrey and
I'm making more golden goat right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be ready in about 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The locals will get them first.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no waiting list.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a way to get on a waiting list
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: After my locals get served up,
they will be dished out to Nature's Green
[SPEAKER_01]: Remedies and Nature'sGreenRemedies.com
will sell out quickly, I promise you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll make an announcement on this show
before they go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when I make those lemon Jeffrey and
the golden goats, I'm also going to put a
[SPEAKER_01]: new cut called Kalonji Kush in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kalonji Kush is the grateful dog,
pollinated the Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I call it Kalonji Kush after a reggae
artist named Sizzla Kalonji.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wondering where my weird names
come from, Kalonji is a reggae artist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sizzla Kalonji.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to cross the golden goat to
the Sizzla Kalonji and I want to call that
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunshine Girl, which is actually a Sizzla
song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think that's going to be pretty
cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple more ideas that I'm going
to put in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two more females that are going in
there for sure, but I don't want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: too much about them until I've got some
seeds in my hands from those because,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, let me tell you a weird side story.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I reversed a golden goat plant,
a female golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I treated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned it into a male and I'll talk more
about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the show, how I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I turned this female plant into a male
and it created pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put that pollen on a room full of
plants and that's how I created the lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I made golden goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another cross in the room that's
never been released or shown to anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: because it only made a few seeds and those
are mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also sprinkled that pollen on
another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strain was headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a headband cut that I got from my
good buddy, Hanky B.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me that headband cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprinkled pollen on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that plant took the pollen,
the pollen plant died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within 24 hours, that plant was dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other plant in the room was healthy
and happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It showed signs of being pollinated just
like it should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what went wrong, but that
headband plant died within 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: taking feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of that from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has an explanation for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant was healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the hell happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put another headband in
there and I'm going to hit it with golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat pollen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a name for it, but I'm
hesitant to say it on the show because
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going to rip me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I say it, then no one can steal it
from me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm saying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat is going to pollinate the
headband plant and I will call it the
[SPEAKER_01]: halo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, you got a headband and now it's
gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's above your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the halo, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call the headband to the
golden goat, the halo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Kalanji Kush to the golden goat
will be the sunshine girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are coming up, you guys,
about 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll need some testers, but I didn't say
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, more about irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently started my work on making black
cherry chem F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: F2 is finial generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made the F1s, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's plush berry was pollinated by a
daybreaker plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seeds that came out of there were
called F1, the first finial generation of
[SPEAKER_01]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I grew a bunch of them out and I
found the male that I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've recently found three females that
are good candidates for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm waiting for these plants to finish
before I commit to which females I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to use to continue the line into F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I choose one, I'm going to,
I'm going to choose two of them actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to hit both of them with the
male pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will keep all of the seeds
separate so that it's phenotype number
[SPEAKER_01]: seven and eight are the two that I'm
really eyeballing for my females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll keep black cherry chem seven and
black cherry chem eight separate and pull
[SPEAKER_01]: all the seeds out and I'll grow a hundred
of each one of those and see which one
[SPEAKER_01]: shows me what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will keep that one to continue
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm waiting for these plants to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to dry them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to turn some of it into dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smoke some of it as flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see which one I really liked the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that will be used to make the F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really trying to stabilize the
purple tree in that strain is what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really want right now I'm getting
about a little more than 50% purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I run a pack of 50, I'll have 25
purple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make it up to closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get like 75%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple plants out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time I'm done,
I'd like to see that purple plant come out
[SPEAKER_01]: almost every time is what I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan to take it to F5 over the next few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll breed the F2s this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've seen out of it that's
really cool is some of the phenotypes look
[SPEAKER_01]: done and they're only 55 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've made a purple strain with a chem
flavor that finishes in about 55 to 65
[SPEAKER_01]: days, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my black cherry chem project
that's going right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out pictures of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them on Instagram and I also put
them on my forum on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to ireageneticscolorado.com,
go to the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be really cool if you join the
forum, sign up and join the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't cost anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing weird is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just a member now and you can
communicate with us and participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every week I go and post a weekly grow
journal of my own gardens up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the black cherry chem has been
highlighted quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see a lot of great pictures of
black cherry chem on my website right now
[SPEAKER_01]: in the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go there and check it out if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ask me questions there and you
talk to me, I really, that's my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: place to go and communicate with people
because they can't censor me because I own
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook can't shut that down or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do what you want to do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I think you're a dick, I might tell you
to quit being a dick, but then grow weed
[SPEAKER_01]: and post your weed pictures there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I can talk about is I'm looking
for an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise is a golden goat that was pollinated
by Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really love that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a great smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes great flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants put on super resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow in a good amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're real stout plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of staking on it if
you find the right phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking for an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to use Arise in a long-term
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will be my long-term breeding male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some beautiful things from the
strain and I'm sure that a good male will
[SPEAKER_01]: make some more amazing crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin production from that plant is so
impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll be a few months before I select
an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the feminized golden goat lemon
Jeffrey project ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the black cherry Kim ahead of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that will be the Arise male
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to find a good Arise male for my
permanent breeding stud, but I plan to
[SPEAKER_01]: make like 15 to 20 F1 hybrids with Arise
to see what works when I do find that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I want to see what can be improved on
or what I need to abandon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you breed, if you take a male
plant and you hit six or seven female
[SPEAKER_01]: plants with it, don't be afraid to throw
away a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to grow those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take a male plant in a room with
like however many females you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: put in there, five, six, maybe 20 females.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to make that many new
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to grow some of each batch of
seeds yourself before you can do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you give them to like your friend
and you say, these are untested,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, because you don't want to put out
seeds that you don't know what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the seeds and grow at least 10,
I would say 100 if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're limited on space and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a phenol hunt of a hundred plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really shows you what's going to
happen, but grow some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they totally suck, throw them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds crazy, but there are
enough strains on the planet to where if
[SPEAKER_01]: you just made some bullshit that doesn't
improve the genetic line, throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we need that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be so attached to your new creation
that, oh, it's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have thrown away more strains than I
have kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all talk about the lemon kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had high hopes for the lemon
kush that I worked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That strain sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted amazing and it grew big fat
donkey dicks for buds, but you couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get high off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not make resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the phenotypes on that plant made
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just that cross did not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the seeds are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the clones are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That project has been abandoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that's a failed project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasted some time, but I don't want to
waste more time or more people's time with
[SPEAKER_01]: the same project by sending out shitty
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a rant on not being too
attachment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lesson in attachment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're too attached to that strain,
then you're wasting your time growing
[SPEAKER_01]: something that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could have been growing something
way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have been breeding something
that was way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you got to learn to let things
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that lesson I talked about my rig
that I dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to sweep it up and move on
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I do get all these new strains
made, I will need help testing these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I like to run a hundred
myself, but I will also send out a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds to reliable testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I know you're a reliable
tester is you've joined my web forum and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have posted pictures of your previous
grows on my forum and you stay in contact
[SPEAKER_01]: with me and you show that you're serious
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of how I find my testers is
off of my own website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the future, if you're interested in
testing, I read genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would help you a lot to join the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do play favorites that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what else to say about I read
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the head breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make 99% of the decisions with help from
my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do let the people around me kind of give
their input because they're cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers, growers, smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot to say, but that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics is all Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have trim friends that helped me shout
out to everybody that's ever came and
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me trim some I read genetic stuff
or shout out to all the people that have
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me package seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the future, I am going to get away
from the feminized seed market as much
[SPEAKER_01]: because feminized seeds are a pain in the
ass to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we should all eventually
step up our game and learn to just grow
[SPEAKER_01]: regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we didn't have male plants,
we wouldn't have more plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's my responsibility to put out more
regular seeds, I think, than I do
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see better shit come from the
regular crosses than I do the fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, feminized seeds are stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't improve on them too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cross that you make, that's what you
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's feminized, if I cross plant A and
plant B, they come out a little bit better
[SPEAKER_01]: than A and B were, but you can't make them
super better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I take a regular male plant and a
female plant and cross that, I see much
[SPEAKER_01]: better stuff come out of that,
much more improved plants, transgressive
[SPEAKER_01]: segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: My offspring will outperform each parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that only happens when I'm using
regular pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't make that happen with my feminized
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a couple of reasons why I
will eventually abandon the feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's eventually, I'm not saying soon,
but one of these days I will stop making
[SPEAKER_01]: fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else to say about
iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much I could say, but I feel
like I'm just stroking my own ego over
[SPEAKER_01]: here talking about iRe a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support iRegenetics, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Rastafarian seed company by
Rastaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of having mass produced
commercial seeds, you've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every seed was touched by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every plant was touched by me,
by my Rastafarian hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a little bit of Rasta love in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that means something to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather buy products from a small
company that cares about their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than the Walmart of whatever industry
you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get onto another topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that I wanted to talk about
feminized seeds a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people seem to have
misconceptions on what feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: are, on how they're made, on where they
come from, and on what they will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that feminized seeds are
straight up hermaphrodite seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I've got a pretty popular seed
company that only sold feminized seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we came up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how iRegenetics would be
popular and or reliable if we just sold a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of damn herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with some basics here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it mean to have feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a few random notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminized seeds mean that the seeds will
produce all female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only say 99% female plants because
this is science and nature and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'll be 99% females.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is helpful because new growers don't
know how to identify male plants in their
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing feminized seeds,
you don't have to watch for the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also makes things easier for growers
with limited space because the grower
[SPEAKER_01]: knows that every seed planted will be a
usable female and none of their space,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, nutrients, water, electricity,
none of that's going to be wasted on
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a male plant that had to be
chopped down 10 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feminized seeds mean that all of the
seeds will produce female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here is where some people are
confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are feminized seeds made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay close attention because honestly you
guys, I'm amazed with myself that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: giving out this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my biggest secrets that I
don't usually share with anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab and a drink before
I share this, but I'm going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: quick dab and a quick drink and then I
will teach you guys how I make reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds on a semi-large scale for
Nature's Green Remedies and patients
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a quick second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab and a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right guys, I am back and heavily
medicated after that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to tell you how I make my
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I got to warn you that the
chemicals that I will describe here are a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit dangerous and you need to
follow the safety rules for these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not responsible for you hurting
yourself or making yourself sick with
[SPEAKER_01]: these chemicals, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm simply telling you how I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do this, follow the instructions,
wear gloves, wear goggles, do everything
[SPEAKER_01]: safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I start is I order silver
nitrate and sodium thiosulfate from a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific supply company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get powdered versions of silver nitrate
and sodium thiosulfate and I mix
[SPEAKER_01]: those two in another container into
another container and now I've got 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: silver thiosulfate in that third container
and I will dilute that to a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: dilution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some plants will need stronger
dilutions of the silver thiosulfate and
some plants will need stronger dilutions
of the sodium thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants will need lighter dilutions of
the silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've learned is some plants I can
treat some plants one time with the silver
[SPEAKER_01]: thiosulfate at a high dilution just before
flower, the day before flower and that
[SPEAKER_01]: will work for that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them I have to make the dilution
much weaker and spray it multiple times
[SPEAKER_01]: and some plants I have to make it stronger
and only spray it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way you'll learn this is
through experimentation by trying plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: by trying different dilutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the silver nitrate into one
container of water, I put the thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_01]: into another container of water,
I shake them up to where it dissolves,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mix equal amounts into another container
and then I take that container and dilute
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the proper dilution for the plant
that I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will, I'm going to use Golden Goat
because I just did this to Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_01]: about seven days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took three Golden Goat plants and I put
them in a small space where there aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: any other plants around, there's no wind
to where my spray is not going to randomly
[SPEAKER_01]: land on other plants because I don't want
to reverse other plants on accident in
[SPEAKER_01]: this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took my three Golden Goat plants,
I put them in a small confined space and I
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed them with my silver thiosulfate
mix at the proper dilution and I sprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants to the point where they are
dripping from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants were covered in the silver
thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful because if you use the silver
thiosulfate at a strong dilution it may
[SPEAKER_01]: turn things purple like the floor or the
spray lands on the wall behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may turn, it may leave little purple
marks so be careful or a little shiny
[SPEAKER_01]: purple mark like shiny iridescent looking
marks I think is the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of neat the way it looks but
it'll screw some stuff up if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want your things purple be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spray the plants then I let them sit
and dry because I want them dry before
[SPEAKER_01]: they go in a flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I let the plants dry then I carry those
plants to the flower room where they will
[SPEAKER_01]: go into flower and I try to spray them
right before the lights off for the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get sprayed they dry and then they
go into the flower room and the lights go
[SPEAKER_01]: off and they have now just gone into
flower and with the Golden Goat I can
[SPEAKER_01]: spray it one time the day of flower and in
about 10 days that plant will show me male
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people are saying how does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to explain this to you kind of
slowly so pay attention because I'm trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to explain it to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any notes on this I'm just
freestyling right now so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is when we spray a female
plant with silver thiosulfate solution the
[SPEAKER_01]: thiosulfate acts as a carrier for the
silver the silver isn't really absorbed by
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves easily but the thiosulfate
makes it get in there a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're tricking the plants into taking
the silver by absorbing the thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when the silver reaches the plants the
silver disrupts the copper movement in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant system there is copper in your
plants yes the silver will disrupt that
[SPEAKER_01]: when that copper movement is disrupted in
the plant system it responds by triggering
[SPEAKER_01]: an ethylene production or I'm sorry an
ethylene it triggers an ethylene response
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not an ethylene production it's an
ethylene response and that ethylene
[SPEAKER_01]: response tells the plant that something is
seriously wrong and it's time to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: survival mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant survival method is to create
male flowers that will create pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: because now all that plant wants to do is
shoot pollen and reproduce to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: species alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've disrupted the copper the plant's
freaking out it panics the panic causes
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene to move through the plant in a
weird way that ethylene triggers the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to throw out flowers that are male flowers
that produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now since those plants that female plant
is all female it does not have any male
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes the only reason it is showing
male sex parts is because I've stressed it
[SPEAKER_01]: and manipulated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will now throw out male parts that
contain pollen and though that pollen will
[SPEAKER_01]: be all female excuse me my throat's
clogging up here from the dabs let me take
[SPEAKER_01]: another drink of water all right that
should help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got female plants that are
spitting out all female pollen and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: taking that pollen and of course putting
it on female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've never introduced any male pollen
here so like I said before 99% of those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants should come out female and the only
reason I can say 99% is because like I
[SPEAKER_01]: said it's science and nature and shit does
happen and also your grow room can cause
[SPEAKER_01]: issues as well your grow style can I'm not
blaming you I'm just saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental factors and all that stuff
plus science and nature will lead to some
[SPEAKER_01]: screw-ups and I'll take credit for part of
those screw-ups because I'm the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: made the seeds but when this is done right
we get quality reliable feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that makes a little bit of sense
I make the psilothiol sulfate and I spray
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants with it and magically that
makes the plants turn into transsexuals
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not male plants they're reversed
females is what we call them and that
[SPEAKER_01]: basically is how I am making feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are not hermaphrodite seeds I'm
not taking hermaphroditic plants and using
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodite pollen I'm not doing
anything crazy ridiculous this is reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that a lot of people are afraid
of feminized seeds is because when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: started there were other less reliable
practices used to make femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: SOMA does another method since we talked
about SOMA earlier in the show SOMA does
[SPEAKER_01]: not use the silver thiosulfate method as
often as I do what SOMA does is he lets
[SPEAKER_01]: his plants grow too long so if he's got a
10-week flowering plant he'll let it grow
[SPEAKER_01]: about 12 weeks and when a plant goes that
long it kind of stresses itself and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it herms out and creates pollen that way
and that's what SOMA is using.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard of SOMA taking a mature
plant and this sounds completely crazy to
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of growers but it'll make sense he
takes a completely mature plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: he will light a small fire and he will put
his plant too close to the fire where the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant panics and the plant feels like it's
a forest fire coming so that plant starts
[SPEAKER_01]: to create male flowers and it's a female
plant it's freaking out it's triggering
[SPEAKER_01]: that survival instinct so it makes those
male flowers which make pollen and then
[SPEAKER_01]: SOMA collects that pollen and sprinkles it
onto other plants and maybe this explains
[SPEAKER_01]: why feminized seeds are so damn expensive
because there are more steps into making
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds than there are to making
regular true breeding male female seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why it's hard for me to keep up
because I have to reverse plants and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get as much pollen from reversing
these plants as I do from a normal male
[SPEAKER_01]: and it takes a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right I feel like I told you enough
about reversing plants I think you should
[SPEAKER_01]: have caught on by now like I said you're
gonna have to experiment with the
[SPEAKER_01]: dilutions and the application rates in Ed
Rosenthal's book I don't have it next to
[SPEAKER_01]: me the Oakster Dam course guide the most
like not even sure that it's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: current but Ed Rosenthal wrote an Oakster
Dam course guide and in that book there is
[SPEAKER_01]: a recipe to make your own silver
thiosulfate that recipe does work although
[SPEAKER_01]: for some plants it will need some
adjusting that's just my advice all right
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to take a fat dab and take a
drink and try to get this frog out of my
[SPEAKER_01]: throat so that I can sound like an actual
podcaster give me one second I'll be right
[SPEAKER_01]: back guys and we will give some shout outs
and wrap up the show all right guys I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: back I want to apologize for taking so
many breaks on you this episode usually I
[SPEAKER_01]: have some guests that can cover me while
I'm coughing and taking a drink or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever but today was just me so you had
to bear with me I apologize hope you
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyed the show I just took a big old fat
dab of some Jack the Ripper shatter made
[SPEAKER_01]: by my good friends at turpex I picked that
up at the green and healthy wellness in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs I don't shop at a lot of
dispensaries because I'm self-sufficient
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was low on shatter I'm just between
harvest right now so I had to pick up a
[SPEAKER_01]: few grams of shatter dude green and
healthy wellness on 212 South 21st Street
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado Springs has the hookups on
turpex shatter if you have to be a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: patient so if you have a medical card and
you were in the Colorado Springs area
[SPEAKER_01]: should if you're in Pueblo or Denver it's
worth the hour drive to head to green and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy cannabis and pick up your turpex
shatter it's a great price I can't tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you how much it is because it's they have
member pricing they have non-member
[SPEAKER_01]: pricing and they have quite a few tiers of
pricing I don't want to get you pumped up
[SPEAKER_01]: because sometimes they run out of the low
pricing stuff but do go to green and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy wellness in Colorado Springs and
get some turpex big shout out to John and
[SPEAKER_01]: John and Jordan and Jordan nothing like a
dispensary with two Johns and two Jordans
[SPEAKER_01]: in it all right also I want to give a big
shout out to my friend Claude the candy
[SPEAKER_01]: man Claude if you're listening to this
show bro big thanks much respect guys
[SPEAKER_01]: support sweet stone candy if you are in
California you can get your sweet stone
[SPEAKER_01]: candy I don't think it's available here in
Colorado anymore but much love much
[SPEAKER_01]: respect to Claude the candy man big shout
out to sweet snow candy also a big hug to
[SPEAKER_01]: Melissa and a little scratch on the head
to sticky the dog shout out also big huge
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to my buddy hunt I always owe
you a big shout out bro you need to come
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show grimy Gatsby on the podcast
that's what I'm saying we are having a
[SPEAKER_01]: growers meeting you guys we do these
growers meetings in the back of hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor growing supplies Jesse gets a topic
started and then I will jump in and help
[SPEAKER_01]: him give a little grow lesson I think
we're gonna talk about um oh no that's all
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the topic is this
week I should text him and find out but
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have a meeting the meeting
is on March 6th at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: at hydro indoor growing supplies grabbing
the paper with the address right now
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't remember the address I do
remember but I don't want to say it wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: it is 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo
Colorado you were invited that's right you
[SPEAKER_01]: were invited if you're listening to this
podcast I think you have to be 21 and over
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a 21 and over event if you're
listening to the show and you're 21 and up
[SPEAKER_01]: you can come to this event it's at hydro
indoor growing supplies March 6th at 6 p
[SPEAKER_01]: .m.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there Jesse will be there
there's a good chance Sean King Cola will
[SPEAKER_01]: be there sometimes Smith shows up Garden
of Weedon comes there will be a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cool people there sometimes we give away
prizes they give away prizes it's not my
[SPEAKER_01]: event I just help out but big shout out to
hydro indoor growing supplies for that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not like I'm gonna start coughing
again I feel like I have a big coughing
[SPEAKER_01]: fit coming so I'm gonna try to wrap up the
show pretty quickly just a short episode
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys seem to pay more attention when
the episodes are shorter I honestly get
[SPEAKER_01]: more listens more completed listens to
episodes under 45 minutes so we might
[SPEAKER_01]: start doing that if you have a show idea
message me I'd love to hear your show
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas this show came all out of emails
that I received from listeners I made this
[SPEAKER_01]: show just for you because of your
questions so if you want to hear listen
[SPEAKER_01]: because it sounds like shit so unless I
can get a really quality recording out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it I won't do it to tell you the truth
I'll wait for them to come to Colorado and
[SPEAKER_01]: I will interview them in person so I hyped
you guys up that the dragonfly earth
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine people are coming there was a
miscommunication they are currently in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington I am in Colorado yeah you heard
me if I can make it happen through a good
[SPEAKER_01]: phone interview I will if it's not quality
I will never play it because I hate when I
[SPEAKER_01]: hear a crappy phone interview on a podcast
but I'm gonna try to get Sean and Jesse
[SPEAKER_01]: back for a soil recycling episode really
soon I've got a lot of cool stuff lined up
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis cup is coming up here pretty
soon actually it's my birthday right now
[SPEAKER_01]: so I got a lot of fun shit happening this
week if you're interested in sponsoring

time for episode number 56 of the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: from your heart podcast your source for
cannabis news education and conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a new grower if you're a pro
grower if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[SPEAKER_01]: dabber if you're a cannabis activist or if
you're just someone who's curious about
[SPEAKER_01]: the current state of cannabis this my
friends is the podcast for you I'm your
[SPEAKER_01]: host Rasta Jeff thanks again for joining
me as always before we get started I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to send a big huge thank you shout out to
Coot and Kat from the Mystic Roots band
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks a lot for letting me use your music
joining me today again is one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: heroes welcome back dude we got King Cola
to the left how are you bro good man
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks for having me oh dude thanks for
coming we're excited about this Sean is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to drop some knowledge on you guys
today that is going to fuck up your whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thought process on growing yeah so I'm
here to to give out some information you
[SPEAKER_03]: can take it or leave it that mic has
impotency problems it likes to droop it
[SPEAKER_03]: after a while yeah I'm not like my word is
not law by any means but this is just my
[SPEAKER_03]: how I grow this is what I have discovered
through my personal studies but I just
[SPEAKER_03]: want to say stop using molasses in your
teas and yeah I mean completely and the
[SPEAKER_03]: main reason is is a lot of people are
using molasses on a regular basis
[SPEAKER_03]: typically when you ask somebody what
they're using in your compost tea and the
[SPEAKER_03]: same for me I think probably on the first
episode I probably even recommended
[SPEAKER_03]: certain rates to use molasses at I think
so you know so I mean you just this is an
[SPEAKER_03]: evolving industry everything changes we
learn as we go but uh so I cut my I heard
[SPEAKER_03]: a while ago basically you need to quit
using somebody told me you need to quit
[SPEAKER_03]: using molasses I said why and they were
you know I'll get back to you and I never
[SPEAKER_03]: heard from them again but it stuck in my
head so I quit using molasses just cut it
[SPEAKER_03]: out and uh I didn't see a difference you
know what I mean it's not like things quit
[SPEAKER_01]: working so it's not acting like the bud
hardener and the sweetener like we think
[SPEAKER_03]: it is maybe yeah you know I didn't I
didn't see it so uh I'm doing my thing and
[SPEAKER_03]: then I get back in touch with this person
and we kind of discuss a little more and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know a lot of people like I was saying
for a basic compost tea what I used to
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend and a lot of people are using
our earthworm castings or Alaskan humus or
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of humic acid they're using
molasses and then they're using like a
[SPEAKER_03]: kelp meal or something well the reason
that you use that molasses in the tea is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually not for the reason that you had
mentioned early when you use excuse me
[SPEAKER_03]: when you use the molasses in a tea it's
not for not so much as a bud hardener for
[SPEAKER_03]: the you know plant it's not so much a
carbohydrate for the plant as it is a food
[SPEAKER_03]: source for the microbes in the tea right
in our teas okay and the thing with
[SPEAKER_03]: molasses is it's a simple carbohydrate and
simple carbohydrates feed simple organisms
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's the simplest way to say it so
molasses is an extremely strong bacteria
[SPEAKER_03]: food uh you've probably heard before that
marijuana is a fungal dominant plant they
[SPEAKER_03]: like fungal dominant teas especially in
flower so by using molasses you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be encouraging bacterial growth well
the molasses not only feeds the bacteria
[SPEAKER_03]: but it feeds it in an enormous rate
bacteria is naturally occurring it's
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere it's already in the soil it's
on our skin it's everywhere and in between
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's already going to be there in your
tea it's going to be in your water it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be in your soil you know probably
some of it's already going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: molasses so there's plenty of bacteria out
there as you add this molasses you start
[SPEAKER_03]: to feed this bacteria and the bacteria
starts to eat the food and they start to
[SPEAKER_03]: digest and what happens is the growth of
the bacteria happens too fast and the
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms uh will actually use up all of
the available food and oxygen resources so
[SPEAKER_03]: you actually drop the dissolved oxygen
levels in your tea so putting molasses in
[SPEAKER_03]: your aact will take out one of those a's
it will make it go anaerobic and you will
[SPEAKER_03]: no longer be having an aerated compost tea
despite you having bubblers running um
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll still you're still going to take
out the oxygen you'll lower the dissolved
[SPEAKER_03]: oxygen levels then you're just harvesting
anaerobic bacteria basically killing off
[SPEAKER_01]: everything we're working to create exactly
by adding the thing that we thought was
[SPEAKER_03]: fueling our fire exactly okay by adding
molasses you're just taking out everything
[SPEAKER_03]: that you just put all of your money and
time into you're just growing the bacteria
[SPEAKER_03]: at a phenomenal rate they're out competing
everything else and that's eventually what
[SPEAKER_01]: you put on your plant i just googled
fungal dominance um we can do an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: episode on that just by what i'm reading
yes you guys are gonna have to go if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to catch up google fungal dominance i
can't even begin to explain it there is so
[SPEAKER_01]: much going on in fungal dominance wow
that'll change your thinking but right
[SPEAKER_03]: there yeah yeah definitely so uh with the
teas like i was saying it so when you add
[SPEAKER_03]: the molasses it can drop the dissolved
oxygen levels for anybody who's listening
[SPEAKER_03]: who wants to know specifically above eight
parts per million of dissolved oxygen is
[SPEAKER_03]: where you want your teas that's when
you're brewing aerobic organisms between
[SPEAKER_03]: six parts per million and eight parts per
million you are facilitating anaerobic
[SPEAKER_03]: zones these organisms out compete the
aerobic organisms at a rate of two to one
[SPEAKER_03]: these facilitate anaerobic zones this is
where some really nasty things live these
[SPEAKER_03]: things are in your compost you are like
these bad organisms are in your compost
[SPEAKER_03]: such as you know really anaerobic or e
coli or these other things just nasties
[SPEAKER_03]: they're gonna multiply at an alarming rate
once you start creating this anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and if you use that as a
foliar spray you just sprayed e coli under
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants right yeah and that's the
thing is they actually like when you your
[SPEAKER_03]: tea starts to do that the organisms that
produce acids that kill anaerobic
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms and high enough qualities these
acids can stress and kill your plant you
[SPEAKER_03]: know in no growing environment anywhere is
there a shortage of bacteria so uh there's
[SPEAKER_03]: no need to just feed more of them and
stress your plants out and uh there's
[SPEAKER_03]: other options instead of molasses so right
off the bat just cut it out so if you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to do a tea what i would recommend would
be uh actually here one second but yeah so
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're gonna start a tea uh i would
just go with worm castings i would go with
[SPEAKER_03]: uh kelp meal and that's just about it
castings and kelp meal yeah i'm sorry i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to i've got everything written up
so yeah there you go he's got his he's got
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole computer in front of them you guys
so i tried to come prepared he came well
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared i kind of peeked at his notes a
minute ago he's got a lot of info yeah so
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got a so basically for for a really
basic compost tea i'm gonna roll with dr
[SPEAKER_03]: elaine ingram's compost tea so her teas
are basically compost or you know worm
[SPEAKER_03]: castings or whatever you can source uh
kelp meal and then you can add in uh
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of molasses you can add in a humic
source so you can add in like a humic acid
[SPEAKER_03]: derived from p like a dragonfly earth
medicine's brilliant black uh there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot i would recommend actually yeah
there's a lot of different options out
[SPEAKER_03]: there but you can add in a humic acid or
in that place you could add in a fish
[SPEAKER_03]: hydrosolate so for your base teas every
time i would just go with worm castings
[SPEAKER_03]: and water outside of that you can add in
kelp meal or alfalfa meal or anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that specific to your stage uh your plant
stage in life and then if you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: start adding foods for the fungal guy
basically if you're in veg fish
[SPEAKER_03]: hydrosolate so for vegetative growth
instead of using molasses replace it with
[SPEAKER_03]: fish hydrosolate now fish hydrosolate it
can it can go the same way as molasses it
[SPEAKER_03]: can turn your tea anaerobic really fast
and i know you're probably thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: anaerobic well you know you i personally
talk about anaerobic teas and bukkashi and
[SPEAKER_03]: all of these things which is you know
they're actually anaerobic fermentations
[SPEAKER_03]: and anaerobic anaerobic compost that's
completely different that's because we
[SPEAKER_03]: want anaerobic environments we don't want
anaerobic bacteria in our aerobic teas
[SPEAKER_03]: okay you know so they're separate but
equal yeah we're making a tea and then
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding that to our exactly you don't yeah
you know so when you're fermenting don't
[SPEAKER_03]: let oxygen get into it and when you're
aerating don't let it go stagnant you know
[SPEAKER_03]: write that down you guys aerobic so as far
as uh food for your teas uh like i was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying if you need to improve your fungal
count uh which everybody wants everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: wants fungal dominant teas you can add a
steel cut oat brand or steel cut oats uh
[SPEAKER_03]: brand powder shrimp shells i mean there's
any sort of uh really any sort of like
[SPEAKER_03]: high protein we can just pick that up at
the health food store right you can pick
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that all right actually there's a
lot of like uh i've seen a lot of stuff on
[SPEAKER_03]: people or people are starting to consume
like fish hydrosolates and stuff which i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know if i'm there yet but uh i mean
i wouldn't be surprised if you can pick
[SPEAKER_03]: that up at the health food store soon
eventually right but uh yeah so you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just molasses i mean take it how you want
it you know take it or leave it i
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend cutting it out i think uh i've
learned from very reputable sources and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know they're these aren't people who
just you know talking you know shit these
[SPEAKER_03]: are real scientists these guys are sitting
there in front of their microscopes and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're straining their minds and their
eyes so we don't have to no i don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to uh try to give yourself any
sort of credit or your sources you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: on here enough and i think people have
realized that you are definitely not full
[SPEAKER_01]: of shit i think you've earned your credit
here i'm gonna give it to you well thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you we respect your opinion i respect your
opinion well thank you i've been at this
[SPEAKER_01]: for years and you teach me stuff every
time you come i really appreciate it and
[SPEAKER_03]: uh but yes i mean just cut the cut the
molasses out of your teas i used to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: every fucking day i mean like every time
my last batch of tea and you know what i
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't see much of a difference i used i
used to use your recommendation or the
[SPEAKER_01]: revs recommendation of molasses in my tea
and i made a tea just a few days ago with
[SPEAKER_01]: some uh bokashi bucket leachate in there
and i actually got way more foam without
[SPEAKER_01]: the molasses on that bucket than i've ever
made that's the best tea i've ever made
[SPEAKER_01]: was my most recent without the molasses
yeah i mean and the plants love yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna get way better results using
uh beneficial microorganisms using things
[SPEAKER_03]: like uh cold process fish hydroslate like
the browns fish hydroslate you grab from
[SPEAKER_03]: rocky mount worm company uh or you can
make your own fish hydroslate but uh those
[SPEAKER_03]: food sources work way better they're way
more natural um it's just like us if we
[SPEAKER_01]: eat natural food our body absorbs it much
more naturally instead of trying to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: mcdonald's or whatever exactly pull out
the nutrients and poop out the crap
[SPEAKER_01]: instead you're able to absorb what you're
eating it's like it should be it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: eating a pop tart or an apple yeah i mean
it's you know how does your body run off
[SPEAKER_03]: of it but uh yeah the so for teas just
keep it simpler the better you know just
[SPEAKER_03]: run your castings run you know your kelp
if you want to add a food source you can i
[SPEAKER_03]: like i really like fish hydroslate during
veg you see tremendous vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_03]: and then that's how you really step away
from bottled nutrients you know that way
[SPEAKER_03]: if you are using bottled nutrients the
only one you're using is the fish product
[SPEAKER_01]: uh what are we using sorry to cut you off
what are we using to feed the tea uh in
[SPEAKER_03]: bloom you keep saying fish hydroslate okay
so for if you're gonna feed your tea in
[SPEAKER_03]: bloom uh uh soft rock phosphate there we
go yeah uh that's a lot in your ogt so
[SPEAKER_03]: soft rock phosphate but that goes right
back into you need to know what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: using how much you're using where you're
sourcing it from you go and you dump
[SPEAKER_03]: astronomical amount of soft rock phosphate
on your plant you're gonna you know like i
[SPEAKER_03]: said that goes right back to you can be
organic and you can be worse than all your
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic buddies out there right i
actually uh i think i overused some ogt
[SPEAKER_01]: because i wasn't i was thinking oh it's
ogt let's fuck it up so i fed it instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of every two weeks i was doing it every
week because i wasn't paying attention and
[SPEAKER_01]: i think the plant sped up too much like
you said because they were burned they
[SPEAKER_01]: were showing nitrogen deficiencies in like
week five yeah and i think they're just
[SPEAKER_03]: going too fast that's more from like the
the trichoderma like screens that they
[SPEAKER_03]: have in there but he has soft rock
phosphate also in there which works as a
[SPEAKER_03]: food for the microbes and it's a fungal
food but you can also get your phosphates
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously from introducing that into the
tea so it's a great that's a great source
[SPEAKER_03]: of uh if you need a bloom tea for say
theoretically you should have all of that
[SPEAKER_03]: admitted in your soil um and it'll just
kind of take up what it wants um which
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of rolls into what we were yeah yeah
that was our um our original idea today
[SPEAKER_01]: was to talk about building a little bit of
soil so i believe you i like your guys the
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses is unnecessary those are old
school farmer tricks we were taught that
[SPEAKER_01]: uh try it yourself make a do a test run
set one set of plants on one side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: room one set on the other add molasses to
one set of tea or however you're feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: and don't add molasses to the other see
the difference for yourself it's uh you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to see enough difference to like
break the bank or anything so give it a
[SPEAKER_03]: try yeah and i mean keep your molasses
around i use it for plenty of stuff uh
[SPEAKER_03]: fpj's a lot of the fermented plant juice
yeah yeah a lot of the korean farming
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques that i do a lot of the homemade
fertilizers i use molasses and like i said
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're going to use it for uh your
sweetener purposes or your hardener
[SPEAKER_03]: purposes or your foliar sprays or if you
use it for stuff but don't use it for the
[SPEAKER_03]: tea's food source and don't use it every
time don't use it for your tea's food
[SPEAKER_01]: source guys we're over we're like over
amping the tea basically we're making
[SPEAKER_01]: hyper little tea yes all that kids just
like sugar yeah they're out competing
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody yeah all right so yeah for soil
mixes uh i really didn't even know where
[SPEAKER_03]: to start for this one i know that
everybody has their own mix everybody has
[SPEAKER_03]: their way of doing things they're super
soils and there's layers and there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: till there's a million ways to do
everything so i just i figured maybe the
[SPEAKER_03]: best way to go about it would be to kind
of just discuss uh you know what what they
[SPEAKER_03]: are so uh okay that sounds great yeah so
um a super soil uh super soils are a term
[SPEAKER_03]: for a nutrient charged soil uh subcool is
the father of super soils yeah subcool
[SPEAKER_03]: made it really famous and basically the
idea is you're going to create this
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient rich mixture of soil and you're
going to layer the bottom of your pot with
[SPEAKER_03]: it and then you're gonna plant your plant
actually into a uh less hot medium like so
[SPEAKER_03]: you would use a bagged soil and so you
would take your five gallon container and
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd fill the bottom so many inches up
with your super soil mix and then add in
[SPEAKER_03]: your bagged soil and then actually
transplant your plant into it
[SPEAKER_03]: theoretically you water your plant the
roots grow through the bagged soil medium
[SPEAKER_03]: into the super soil okay and then you
never have to fertilize your plant you can
[SPEAKER_03]: just always feed a water you know every
time because everything's already
[SPEAKER_03]: everything's already mixed in a bowl of
food at the bottom um so that's one method
[SPEAKER_03]: of uh mixing uh another method for a lot
of people is uh just like a complete
[SPEAKER_03]: through and through mix so like a dragon
fly earth medicine just does a really
[SPEAKER_03]: really awesome mix where they do it's
similar to the super soil but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually incorporated throughout the
entire mix okay so you don't like stir the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing exactly so there is no like
layering and you don't pad it with you
[SPEAKER_03]: know other soil what they'll do is they
they make their soil and then they do
[SPEAKER_03]: what's a term called cooking which is just
composting so they let their soil sit for
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple of weeks or a month you know the
longer the better and by doing that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can really encourage natural processes and
if you go to dragon fly earth medicines
[SPEAKER_03]: feed they've got some really cool things
about how they'll you know if you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil that's cooking they'll treat with uh
bukkashi and lactic acid bacteria and they
[SPEAKER_03]: pour all their excess compost teas on it
and you can do these things too while your
[SPEAKER_03]: soil cooks but uh they do like really it's
more of a botanical mixture uh they use
[SPEAKER_03]: like a kelp meal alfalfa nettle um you can
go to their website to their feeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of find out i don't want to give away
out there yeah go check them out
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely but they've got some check out
dragon fly earth medicine we'll get them
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show one day uh they're in canada
they said they were gonna come here and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they had to go back to canada or
washington they're right by canada yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: they had to skip out on the pacific
northwest they're just holding it down up
[SPEAKER_03]: there actually they're in uh europe right
now or if they went to like prog or they
[SPEAKER_01]: went all over this istanbul they're going
everywhere because when they come back
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna do an interview with me and
they're gonna tell me about all the things
[SPEAKER_01]: they've seen around the world so that'll
be great yeah but they've been protecting
[SPEAKER_03]: uh perfecting the soil mix for a while and
you know i mentioned them because they do
[SPEAKER_03]: like a completely botanical base you know
everything's plant-based with their mixes
[SPEAKER_03]: i know a lot of other people are
traditionally doing especially like with
[SPEAKER_03]: uh the rev and some other people uh
moonshine man and there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_03]: mixes out there which are all uh bone meal
blood meal phosphates it's real similar to
[SPEAKER_03]: subcool's mix but it's the same idea that
you mix it throughout the whole batch and
[SPEAKER_03]: you let it cook for a period of time and
then you grow into it and we got to get
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the blood meal and the bone meal
yeah the feather meal yeah there's uh
[SPEAKER_03]: alternatives i mean you know bone meal a
soft rock phosphate calm free metal yarrow
[SPEAKER_03]: fish bone meal there's other options blood
meal uh which is your nitrogen source uh
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah there's i don't even need to like get
into there's so many other nitrogens
[SPEAKER_03]: alfalfa that's been the most popular
lately yeah there's there's so many other
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen sources i don't even need to
cover that but uh i mean you definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: source where your product are coming from
uh me personally uh i go with a very
[SPEAKER_03]: simple mix uh i use typically i like to
mix my own soil base uh the best mixture
[SPEAKER_03]: i've ever used personally was um it's a
product called malibu compost it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: biodynamic compost blend uh it's fucking
awesome it's only available in california
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really hard to get here i was
fortunate enough to come across a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of bags and uh it was probably some of the
best product they use but it's a compost
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a soil mix who's in california
that can send us a couple of bags of that
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody hook me up please yeah we need
that malibu compost i'll give you my p.o
[SPEAKER_03]: box number just hook me up yeah but it's a
biodynamic blend so they have like yarrow
[SPEAKER_03]: and nettle and dandelions and all sorts of
cool stuff mixed in there but uh so i used
[SPEAKER_03]: uh so i'll use a compost and then cut it
in with pearlite i'm not sorry not
[SPEAKER_03]: pearlite i use a compost and then i cut it
in with uh worm castings uh so i make my
[SPEAKER_03]: own like vermicompost so i'll use the yeah
the malibu compost rocky mount worm
[SPEAKER_03]: castings and then i'll add in an aerator
which is typically a lot of people use
[SPEAKER_03]: pearlite i don't like pearlite so much so
i use uh diatomite because i've got a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: bag of it i've had for like years i'm
still working through it but you can use
[SPEAKER_03]: like pumice or lava rock i'd like to
recommend people use things that don't go
[SPEAKER_03]: away as fast you know uh pearlite floats
to the top and it grinds up really fine
[SPEAKER_03]: and it just kind of goes away to nothing
but i always recommend people to do like a
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 like lava rock or pumice or diatomite
something that doesn't break down as quick
[SPEAKER_03]: and then do another 50 like the other half
do like a rice hole or buckwheat hole okay
[SPEAKER_03]: or some you know more of a carbon-based
aerator all right uh so yeah we put in our
[SPEAKER_03]: aerator and then after your compost and
your aerator then you make the decision of
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not you're going to want to use
coco core or peat moss i like peat moss
[SPEAKER_03]: but i like the environment too and uh so
you kind of got it all comes from like one
[SPEAKER_03]: swamp in canada or something yeah you know
so you got it like i said organics it
[SPEAKER_03]: seems like it's always awesome but it's
not always the best you just kind of got
[SPEAKER_03]: to pick what you want i've actually found
best result i like a mixture of coco and
[SPEAKER_01]: peat moss there's something about the oils
that come from the coco fiber that the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant really likes yeah i really like a
mix of uh i've been playing around gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: take a dab so you better keep talking no
you're good yeah i've been playing around
[SPEAKER_03]: with different ratios uh 50 50 75 25 uh of
coco to peat moss but i kind of like a
[SPEAKER_03]: half and half mixture with it and then uh
outside of that we'll go in and then add a
[SPEAKER_03]: kelp meal crustacean knee moisture shell
powder glacial rock dust jimson uh if we
[SPEAKER_03]: really want to get into it we'll add you
know biochar and bukkashi and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: other natural farming inputs but that's
personally for like my home grow i can
[SPEAKER_01]: give uh into it with that stuff but you
guys can too uh listen to this episode hit
[SPEAKER_01]: pause and rewind all that stuff and listen
back and make a list and if you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: afford to buy a bunch of shit buy the
first two yeah and the next time buy the
[SPEAKER_01]: buy three of them and then you'll make a
better soil every every time and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: start you'll start seeing good you should
get great results right off the bat
[SPEAKER_03]: actually if you if you think if you if you
play it back and you think it's too
[SPEAKER_03]: overwhelming i tell you what i i do work
with the dispensaries a lot you know i i
[SPEAKER_03]: run a consultation company so if any of
you guys out there know anybody who i hate
[SPEAKER_03]: the word come i hate saying i'm gonna do
consultations but uh if anybody out there
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to switch you know any facilities
that want to switch we're all licensed to
[SPEAKER_03]: be here natural farming and you know we've
got our cards we can go in and help your
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite growers convert to organics but i
work with a couple of different shops and
[SPEAKER_03]: they always seem a little overwhelmed when
i come in there and i start running my
[SPEAKER_03]: mouth about mixing soils and you're gonna
get this and this and this and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna mix it together and it's
overwhelming they like the when you can
[SPEAKER_03]: walk in there and you can be like yep buy
a pallet of this and i want a pallet of
[SPEAKER_03]: that so uh i've actually got a mixture for
everybody out there who wants to go and
[SPEAKER_03]: just buy a pallet of soil or you want to
go buy a bail of pro mix or some sunshine
[SPEAKER_03]: for so just go and grab your uh sunshine
for your pro mix i recommend cutting in
[SPEAKER_03]: worm castings 10 for your microbial source
uh then i would just add and depending on
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're going with so if you go with
like a sunshine for advanced they've got
[SPEAKER_03]: like a nutrient starter pack which is i
think uh there's some like minerals in
[SPEAKER_03]: there other things like that yeah and uh
that one's a really good one to go with
[SPEAKER_03]: and then just add in your worm castings
kelp meal neem uh neem cake and crustacean
[SPEAKER_03]: milk or oyster shell powder just kind of
depending on how you want to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: personally but that's it that's that's a
good start right there and uh i've i've
[SPEAKER_03]: tried them out like right now if you go to
the king underscore cola feed on instagram
[SPEAKER_03]: you can look at the uh there's pictures of
worms just all over the containers you
[SPEAKER_03]: know top soils move in and that's actually
all done in sunshine for with kelp neem
[SPEAKER_03]: crustacean and oyster shell powder nice uh
really simple i mean i feel like i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: getting some of the best results that i've
ever had with this super the between this
[SPEAKER_03]: mix and then the mix i had mentioned
earlier with malibu compost are probably
[SPEAKER_03]: the two best results i've gotten since
i've started okay um you know it's so hard
[SPEAKER_03]: to source a solid like place to get
compost so if you can't do that and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't make your own compost i mean nothing
there's no shame in going and buying a bag
[SPEAKER_01]: of soil oh no you know what i mean like
everybody i don't know i can always start
[SPEAKER_01]: a bokashi bucket that's a great way to
make some over the past three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks i don't know how long i've been
talking about the bokashi bucket but i see
[SPEAKER_01]: it turning into funk inside that bucket
and i will have uh that's a five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket essentially i'll have five gallons
of compost to add to a whole bunch of dirt
[SPEAKER_01]: and then in a month or two i will have my
own amazing compost bottle started from
[SPEAKER_03]: that exactly and i mean even like even
buying soil from the store using the
[SPEAKER_03]: nicest castings that money can buy like a
rocky mile worm castings and uh it's still
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy and then after amending the soil
soil it's amazing how cheap this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out i'm not going to say the name of
this like shop that i'm working for but i
[SPEAKER_03]: will say that they're running 480 20
gallons and we priced them out at a dollar
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 per gallon of soil wow that's amazing
so suck on that one synthetics there you
[SPEAKER_01]: go guys and that's for a dispensary so
they have to rely on quality products
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly i'm gonna do a quick commercial i
hate to sneak in a commercial but i have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do them and this is a great time uh
because a lot of what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic portions portions i'm gonna
try this commercial again the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: portions of this episode were sponsored by
my friends at the rocky mountain worm
[SPEAKER_01]: company visit the rocky mountain worm
company in colorado springs for fresh worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings african night crawlers red
wigglers and all of your soil amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: the rocky mountain worm company has
dragonfly earth medicine products in stock
[SPEAKER_01]: right now we've been talking about that a
lot they have the fish hydrosolates there
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got brilliant black humic from
dragonfly earth medicine uh they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the stuff we talked about you can
grab right there at the rocky mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: worm company so go in there that you can
actually get their products if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: listening far away you can get their
products shipped to your door you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: the same worm casting shun and i use in
our gardens many of the same amendments

[SPEAKER_01]: right i didn't want to interrupt the show
but those guys paid me money for that so
[SPEAKER_01]: um what else you got on making your own
soil or do you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: something different um no i think that
that's a this is a good point to go back
[SPEAKER_03]: to high grow uh oh i do want to mention
because i feel like we've been talking i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to snub your other people oh no
they got so we're talking about uh no i
[SPEAKER_03]: mean because i was telling people to go
and grab soil mix you know go yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah i want to we'll work with jesse a
little bit and we'll try to get uh we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: call it a rocky mountain natural farming
mix up there for you at the store because
[SPEAKER_03]: i mean they already carrying the soil
they've already got the castings up there
[SPEAKER_03]: they've got krakashi up there yeah um yeah
you talk to jesse we can get you fixed
[SPEAKER_03]: with the rocky mountain natural farming
mix which is like i said it's i mean pro
[SPEAKER_03]: mix sunshine four kelp crustacean neem get
to rocking we'll try to get hey guys at
[SPEAKER_01]: high grow here's my idea i want you to set
up one little section just a shelf that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can just walk right there and get this
stuff like it'll be the grow from your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart uh rocky mountain worm castings high
grow indoor growing supplies little bonus
[SPEAKER_01]: section and just go right there there'll
be some grokashi there we'll do the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing up at the shop for you too that'd be
so awesome let's do this guys that's my
[SPEAKER_03]: proposal to you guys yeah i'd appreciate
it so go if you can't if you can't source
[SPEAKER_03]: compost and all of that jazz then go to
your local hydro store high grow and uh
[SPEAKER_03]: grab your bagged soil get you some basic
amendments and the the trick is is to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out what works for you um i don't
like this like one size fits all idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: growing um because it doesn't you know i
mean you probably water completely
[SPEAKER_03]: differently i bet i bet completely
differently if i used your soil mixing
[SPEAKER_03]: methods i would probably slaughter those
plants i guarantee i'd kill every single
[SPEAKER_03]: one of them um and then you do the same
thing in my style does that mean that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a better grower than me or vice
versa no it doesn't exactly it's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: matter of you've got to dial it in you
know i would recommend starting out with a
[SPEAKER_03]: pro mix or a sunshine four uh once you get
a grower two down with that and your
[SPEAKER_03]: really basic soil amendments then all
sunshine four and pro mix is is peat moss
[SPEAKER_03]: and an aerator and you know so you source
those products it's actually what my last
[SPEAKER_03]: run was done in was sunshine four promix
yeah and uh you know so i mean i think
[SPEAKER_03]: people get overwhelmed when you start
talking about the conversion to organics
[SPEAKER_03]: but if they only knew how close they
already were you know so many synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: growers are using sunshine four and
they're using promix it's like well next
[SPEAKER_03]: time you do that just add in a microbial
source like earthworm castings add in some
[SPEAKER_03]: kelp meal you know to help prevent against
you know fungus gnats and white flies and
[SPEAKER_03]: spider mites add in some neem cake or
crustacean meal uh yeah i mean easy stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that ready you're mixing soil anyway
you should be yeah you shouldn't i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think you should open the bag and just
start pulling out of the bag you should
[SPEAKER_03]: dump it into something kind of spread it
out like i was surprised to learn that
[SPEAKER_03]: like i said i've always grown organically
so i was i see a lot of the commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: synthetic growers and kind of how they're
doing stuff and i was really surprised to
[SPEAKER_03]: see even they've been the shit out of
their soil i mean they're growing you know
[SPEAKER_03]: in promix and that they go and pour in the
end they're still running nutrients over
[SPEAKER_01]: and kill it all and uh yeah i mean that
was something we were trying to talk to a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend about last night is finding that
balance between the worm castings and the
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced nutrients he's like can i do this
and we're trying to tell him gently that
[SPEAKER_01]: your advanced is just going to kill all
that stuff bro throw away those advanced
[SPEAKER_03]: bottles yeah you know i if you're want to
make the if you want to make the switch
[SPEAKER_03]: then you need to not get advanced
nutrients go get something like a general
[SPEAKER_03]: organics or roots organics or bio biz and
even botanic air is not as organic as they
[SPEAKER_03]: try to advertise it's far from it yeah i
mean even if you were to go age old is uh
[SPEAKER_03]: really old school product it really is so
cheap and i know so many people who crush
[SPEAKER_01]: it with age old i've got a friend who
grows nothing but i read genetics with
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing but age old and it's so cheap i
mean you want to talk about low cost of
[SPEAKER_03]: production who cares if i mean you know
you'll yield good but even if you didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so fucking cheap you're only paying
for power right yeah that's the truth and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the beauty of organics organics i'm
making the switch and i love it i've
[SPEAKER_01]: really seen a difference in my plants uh
they perform better they don't seem and i
[SPEAKER_01]: do i haven't grown cannabis for a long
time and the plants always seem like they
[SPEAKER_01]: were thriving to me and now that i'm using
the organics i can see that i was missing
[SPEAKER_01]: something they look they just look they're
waxier they don't have they have more uh
[SPEAKER_01]: the cuticles on the leaves are thicker uh
the stems are more robust and i was
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding i've fed all the commercial brands
of nutrients before and i'm definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: noticing a difference with just basic and
just small jumps to organics it's not even
[SPEAKER_03]: anything major well and then you tell me
you since you come from uh the synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: growth is it easier i hear a lot of people
tell me it's more complicated but i am not
[SPEAKER_03]: the most i mean i do a lot of other stuff
i'm not in my growth like i used to be and
[SPEAKER_01]: my my plants are fine the way i think this
seems to make more sense to me than mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: up bottles like a scientist yeah and i've
read all of my bottles anyway so i know
[SPEAKER_01]: what that's coming from like i know that
that's chicken shit and seabird guano why
[SPEAKER_01]: don't i just use chicken shit and seabird
guano yeah like and i think i didn't trust
[SPEAKER_01]: myself to make those mixtures i thought
i'd burn something or whatever but there
[SPEAKER_01]: are so many guides between you the rev and
every forum on the internet i can find the
[SPEAKER_01]: correct mixture for everything and this
podcast now this is a good reference your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants are going to be way more forgiving
to you putting the guano on it than to you
[SPEAKER_03]: putting a bottled nutrient that's got
guano in it on it true very true that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more concentrated and i can definitely add
too much of that way easily exactly yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah i don't even like using guano i'm
gonna stay away from any kind of shit in
[SPEAKER_03]: my plants guano is actually extremely
unsustainable to harvest um and then it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really bad for you to breathe in but i
know a lot of people are diehard about it
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah and uh personally i think it like
produces some really awesome outdoor um
[SPEAKER_01]: jesse will swear by it for the outdoor
yeah for outdoor growers jesse would come
[SPEAKER_01]: chop us down right now for saying bad
things about us drinking guano yeah the
[SPEAKER_03]: guano is pretty banging for outdoor um not
you know there's other options but hey
[SPEAKER_01]: right to each his own and if we're dissing
your growing methods i'm sorry we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: dissing it we're just uh trying to
encourage you to do more sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: healthier things yeah do what you want do
what you want you're gonna get if you if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're okay with it go for it yeah i just
don't want to i don't eat meat you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what i mean i don't i don't eat gmo foods
i live i have a certain lifestyle that i
[SPEAKER_03]: try to live by and i incorporate that all
the way into the medicine and the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that i grow so you know i don't force i
hang out with people who eat meat hang out
[SPEAKER_03]: with people who grow synthetics like it's
no big like to each his own you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: to i really i get attacked a lot on
instagram and a lot of these like other
[SPEAKER_03]: places when i feel like when i try to put
information out there i feel like i get
[SPEAKER_03]: met with a lot of resistance um but i'm
not telling i'm not trying to tell people
[SPEAKER_03]: how to do things i'm just trying to give
it put information out there um so please
[SPEAKER_03]: don't argue with me if you like it take it
in you know if you don't unfollow me yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: follow someone else there's plenty of
other instagram pages to troll you know
[SPEAKER_03]: you can hit those yeah you know but uh
that being said if you if you ever have
[SPEAKER_03]: questions and you're serious and you want
to know something just uh direct message
[SPEAKER_03]: me email me email jeff yeah i got your
back you will get the you know we'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: you the knowledge you need yeah we know
we've got resources for all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge it was funny because we were at
a growers meeting last night and shauna
[SPEAKER_01]: and i were both stumped on something and
people looked at us like well what the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck if you guys don't know then what is
the answer you're like sorry guys there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some shit we're not gonna know i've never
seen that so i don't know give me three
[SPEAKER_01]: days to research it we'll find out but
right now you might have to call jim
[SPEAKER_01]: ferrer yeah but i feel like people have
this like i don't know they've got this
[SPEAKER_03]: idea that we can just like look at one
picture on your phone or you're gonna send
[SPEAKER_03]: me a one direct message and i'm gonna know
what you fed him for the past three weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah we'll try yeah we'll try but
sometimes yeah that one last night was a
[SPEAKER_01]: weird challenge i don't know what it was
it was powdery something mildewish looking
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff unfortunately that was a case of uh
all too it's all too familiar i like i
[SPEAKER_03]: knew him personally i was actually working
with him on that before the meeting he was
[SPEAKER_03]: introduced to me through a friend of mine
but uh yeah i thought it was powdery
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew originally and then we thought it
was a ph problem and they thought it was
[SPEAKER_03]: new lock and it's all too familiar of a
problem he actually you know wasn't too
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar with growing uh went to the local
hydro store not high grow because if you
[SPEAKER_03]: you know jesse would have helped him the
guy would have been killing it but he goes
[SPEAKER_03]: to these horrible competitors here in town
and they set him up on what he thinks is
[SPEAKER_03]: cocoa uh they give him a cocoa nutrient uh
he's running it turns out it's peat moss
[SPEAKER_03]: oh man and he you know so it happens and
he's embarrassed and it's not his fault no
[SPEAKER_03]: don't be embarrassed you guys awesome and
he's learned so much and he's his plants
[SPEAKER_03]: are still alive even after all of that you
know like i mean his we saw fucked up
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures of him but hey they're still
kicking yeah if he makes it to harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what counts you know but uh
perseverance you know you just got to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: stay committed to it don't if you think
that i grow beautiful plants every time
[SPEAKER_01]: you're out of your mind oh man i just
don't picture i just don't put pictures of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ugly ones on instagram there's plenty
of ugly shit that i've done i'll admit it
[SPEAKER_01]: one time i had and this was years ago the
first time it was the first time i said i
[SPEAKER_01]: was in a new house growing in a brand new
basement in the middle of winter and i'd
[SPEAKER_01]: never grown in there before and you got to
dial in a room but i had a white rhino
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in a seven gallon pot that probably
weighed between five and six ounces and i
[SPEAKER_01]: went to cut it down and i noticed powdery
mildew all up the one side that was near
[SPEAKER_01]: the exterior wall corner so that wall was
colder than the whole rest of the room and
[SPEAKER_01]: it got powdery mildew uh it was ugly as
shit my buddy mike was there helping me
[SPEAKER_01]: trim and i said hey mike watch this and i
chopped the plant and usually he's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: hand on it when i cut it so that it
doesn't timber you know and i just cut
[SPEAKER_01]: that son of a bitch right to the ground

[SPEAKER_01]: difference and i like it honestly guys i

cupboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, shout out to Soyl Grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are on Instagram, check out at
Soyl Grown on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude is killing it with some new
things called rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are going to try making rosin
tech, don't burn yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I've got to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start seeing, we've seen
rosin tech happen and then we've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: people follow suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm waiting for the rosin tech
burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to be next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you're on Instagram, check out
Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I want to talk about more in the
future is the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I'm experimenting with
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot believe I didn't do this earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot to Rocky Mountain Worm
Company and Sean for hooking me up with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Game changer, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added the liquid that came out of there
to my worm tea and it's the best worm tea
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw results within 24 hours on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody out there check out the
Bokashi bucket on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have their own page.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a super awesome group of guys down
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had the pleasure of meeting them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I gave one of the guys,
one of their first dabs here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually at the Emerald Cup,
but I was dabbing them out on some full
[SPEAKER_03]: melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the Bokashi bucket guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can pick up the buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're Hydro Shop or if the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company does have them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you're not near us, you can get
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bokashi bucket guys have a website or
also Whole Foods sells them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a Whole Foods in your area,
go check out the chicks in the yoga pants
[SPEAKER_01]: and Ugg boots and pick yourself up a
Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, let's wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's much left to say
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a lot of work.

notes because I took a page and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.

[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hippy Nurse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you write down a bunch of notes.

conversation.

activist or someone who's just curious
[SPEAKER_01]: about the current state of cannabis,
this my friends is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to send a big huge thank
you shout out to the Mystic Roots band for
[SPEAKER_01]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big huge thanks to Kat and Coot and the

[SPEAKER_01]: How are you guys doing today, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hanging out by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just me getting down to some reggae
music, taking some dabs, dabbing on some
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem Dog Nectar that I picked up at Nugs
with Green and Healthy Cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some delicious shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had me a little Twitter paid it all day
from this shatter, digging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just me hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to turn down the music and
we're going to read some news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an iTunes comment to read,
but before we get that, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a quick break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.

[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the information that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn it on the music here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little loud in my ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn that down and let's go to iTunes
and let's read an iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comment is from White Trike.
[SPEAKER_01]: The comment is, this show is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks a lot for the comment White
Trike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like hearing that the show is great and
I like the encouragement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely, definitely will keep it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to everybody that's left to comment
in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually got a couple of Twitter
comments I want to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm doing a Doug Benson
standup comedy show because Doug Benson
[SPEAKER_01]: just stands there and reads tweets the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what I'm doing to you
guys, but I like supporting the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wouldn't be a podcast if there
weren't listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd just be me talking into a mic for no
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you guys a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scrolling through, looking for this
notification here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Omnio, he says, sitting in the garden
in the sun while listening to Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Grow From Your Heart podcast
explain worm castings, benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: and seed genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag good life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Omnio, dude, thanks for listening to
me while you're gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm hoping for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are in the garden learning
stuff while you're playing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're on the drive to or from work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I'm in your ear entertaining you
and teaching you something about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, let's see, Adrian Gee, the amazing
Adrian.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, at Grow... It could be he or she.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check on your stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to call you he if you're a
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adrian is kind of a unisex name.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that is a dude in that picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, Adrian says, I got to go back to
your comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just started listening to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good info.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I replied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, thanks for listening on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to teach you guys, trying to
educate a little bit, trying to move
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we talk more positively about
this plant, people will be less afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all we got to do is open the door to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, big thanks and big shout out to
White Trike for the iTunes comment there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you leave a comment on iTunes or
Stitcher, I will read it on the show you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't want to leave a comment
on iTunes or Stitcher, send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at GFYH podcast or find me on
Facebook and I'll respond to you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to say something anonymously,
you can send me a personal or private
[SPEAKER_01]: message and I will keep your name private.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a lot of contact
information, but if you want to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: touch, I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said at the beginning of the show
that I had a bunch of news and stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's click on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clicking away, click, click, click.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm finding the first news article.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first news article is, it kind of hits
home here because I actually am a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you become a caregiver,
all you really have to do is have... So
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we call the person that smokes
the medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That person goes to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get their medical marijuana
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you send that into the state
of Colorado, you can assign a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where my name goes onto that
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name and my address and a copy of my ID
gets sent to the state and I become a
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver, which means I am now
responsible for growing medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for my friend who signed me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a limit of five people that
you're allowed to be a caregiver for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have yourself plus five other
people and you can grow cannabis for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you were allowed to have six
plants per person, but then there are
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors that are willing to write you an
extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you say, my back hurts a lot or I've
got fibromyalgia and I don't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, I actually make oils out of all
of this and I need a lot more plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctors will be a little compassionate
and they will write you what's called an
[SPEAKER_01]: extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that costs you more money,
but in the long run, that's worth it
[SPEAKER_01]: because you need your medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just allows you to grow more
plants and possess more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the state has kind of caught on that
some people are going to the doctor and
[SPEAKER_01]: there are some doctors in Colorado that it
just costs money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want the original six plants,
it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go in there and pay a cheap like $45,
$50 visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want 12 plants, they double it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want 25 plants, they pretty much
quadruple your price.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wanting 50 plants, you're paying
five times what you did before.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some doctors that will write a
99 plant recommendation for $500 flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can grow 99 plants in your house
for $500 for one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it was, but now they're making
all kinds of rules because they have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is a lot of people sign up
for 99 plants and if you grow 99 seven
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pots, hopefully you're pulling a
whole bunch of weight and then that's
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting the black market and they're kind
of aware of that and they don't want that
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in the state of Colorado
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really trying to crack down and
tax every gram of pot that's produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a sip here and then I'll
read you this news article I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some yerba mate here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this news article comes from a website
called The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pull a lot of news articles from this
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was actually published February 26th,
so I'm a little bit behind, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: still relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article was by Joey Bunch of the
Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline is, Colorado MMJ caregiver
bill clears Senate committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article says, A state Senate committee
on Thursday unanimously approved a bill
[SPEAKER_01]: that would require medical marijuana
caregivers to register and allow state
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies to share enough information to
ensure pot grown for medicine isn't sold
[SPEAKER_01]: illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: While pot sold for recreational use has
been subject to a battery of tests and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations since it became legal last
year, medical marijuana has gone
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively unregulated requiring only that
caregivers be at least 18 years old and
[SPEAKER_01]: have some significant responsibility for
the care of a licensed medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: user.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a spot on the application
that asks what services you provide for
[SPEAKER_01]: your patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write spiritual counseling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write that I drive them to and from
their doctor's appointments because a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prepare meals for some of my patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ask for what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to fill that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually they denied one of my
caregiver requests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to refill out the paper and put
better reasoning because they did not like
[SPEAKER_01]: my reasons why I was part of their
significant responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are paying a little bit of
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get back to the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, The regulatory bill was
characterized by the state agency and law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement officials as a benefit to
caregivers because those registered would
[SPEAKER_01]: not have to face arrest or a costly legal
proceedings if they're registered with the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bill is supported by the Colorado
Cannabis Chamber of Commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical marijuana supporters testified
they were concerned about costs from
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, patient privacy and the risks
of untested medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bill is really about assessing law
enforcement, but it's doing so at the
[SPEAKER_01]: expense of the rights of patients and
caregivers, said Colorado marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: activist, Robert Chase, who opposed the
legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legislation, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2009, when the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attorney General's office advised federal
agents not to intervene in cases that are
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant with state laws, medical
marijuana license have exploded in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2008, there were 4,819 licensed medical
marijuana patients in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: said Senator Irene Aguilar.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of last December, there were 115,400
167 licensed users, said Aguilar,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bill's Senate sponsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to keep federal regulators out of
Colorado's pot business, the state must
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate it adequately, she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal expectation is that states
that have allowed marijuana to be legal
[SPEAKER_01]: and local governments will be implementing
strong and effective regulatory and
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement systems that will protect
public safety, public health and law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement interests, she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the average age of Colorado medical
marijuana user is 42 years old,
[SPEAKER_01]: the number of children has increased in
the past two years on indications pot
[SPEAKER_01]: helps children with seizures and other
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In March 2013, Colorado had 35 patients
younger than 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: By last December, the number of minors had
grown to 462, Aguilar said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sierra Riddle of Colorado Springs said she
moved from Utah in 2013 because her son
[SPEAKER_01]: has cancer and needs medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Team Landon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know Sierra was going to be
mentioned in this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are people that we support in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So support Team Landon and Sierra Riddle
if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this article kind of hits home
because I'm a caregiver myself and the
[SPEAKER_01]: local rules are changing here to where we
are being reduced on the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients we are allowed to have,
which will also reduce the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants we are allowed to have,
and they have also reduced the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: space we are allowed to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means the five people that I am
responsible for providing medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana to, somebody is going to have to
find somebody else to grow their medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state doesn't give a shit that I
have been responsible for them for the
[SPEAKER_01]: past seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been my responsibility and my duty
to take care of these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have established a relationship with
them and I have a significant role in
[SPEAKER_01]: caring for these people, but the state
does not care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to end that and find a new
caregiver to grow their medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's bullshit because I know
these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what strains they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have bred strains for my patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people that smoke medical cannabis
and I will breed strains for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The night nurse was inspired by my friend
Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an older cat and his body hurts and
he has a hard time sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he smoked the Tora he said,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he smoked the grateful dog,
he said, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were two of his favorite strains
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I felt like it was my job to make a
hybrid of the two and then find the right
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype that worked for Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I grew those, he loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Doug, I don't get to be your
caregiver anymore because the state
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't give a shit about our bona fide
relationship that we've developed over
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really Doug, I'm keeping it,
but that's my example.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Team Landon, there are little kids out
there with brain tumors, cancers,
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures, lymphoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids have all kinds of bad things that
adults have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we need to let these kids have
their caregivers have plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I'm fired up because this is
what medical, this is what started the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis movement in Colorado was medical
cannabis and caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caregivers are what started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients and the caregivers are ground
zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now guess who's being screwed right
out of this deal?
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients and the caregivers because
they want us to be forced to shop at
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational dispensaries where taxes are
fucking ridiculous and we cannot afford
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to medicate ourselves
that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we're medicating ourselves with
cannabis is so that we don't have to jump
[SPEAKER_01]: through somebody else's hoops so that we
don't have to go stand in line to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous prices for medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucking us over guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, end of rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm passionate about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pisses me off because the patients that
started medical cannabis are now the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that nobody, I can't say nobody,
the people that most of this industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: looking over right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've forgotten them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the patients, there would have
been no medical marijuana movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would not have been caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would have not been home grows and
we would not have gotten as far as we've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be years behind if we did not start
this with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about the patients, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to register my grows
with my city and with my state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to come do my private grow
and they're going to look through my grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure that I'm following all of
the laws and that everything is done up to
[SPEAKER_01]: code.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sign up to do that because
I'm well known around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't do it, I know they will
come here and they will try to press some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of legal charges on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are paperwork, papers that I can
fill out to have an excuse or an exception
[SPEAKER_01]: to have more patients, but I don't see,
I'm going to really have to pull a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons out of the air because their
paperwork, they don't have any compassion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have check marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this, this, and this happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like talking to a computer
instead of a person with compassion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough on that article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I calmed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so pissed off about that last
article anymore, but we have a whole new
[SPEAKER_01]: article coming up and this could,
this could do a lot of things to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sub headline is another lawsuit has
been filed in federal court over
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's marijuana legalization
amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline is new lawsuit, sheriffs from
Colorado and elsewhere challenge amendment
[SPEAKER_01]: 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes the new suit unique is that it
is also asking for a federal judge to
[SPEAKER_01]: overturn amendment 64 protections for
marijuana use and possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article is written by Kirk Mitchell
and John Engel of the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six Colorado sheriffs sued their own
governor in federal court on Thursday,
[SPEAKER_01]: arguing that state laws legalizing
marijuana require them to violate federal
[SPEAKER_01]: law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining the sheriffs in the lawsuit,
the fourth to be filed against Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: over marijuana legalization are the
sheriffs and prosecutors from Nebraska and
[SPEAKER_01]: Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The suit argues that federal law supremacy
means Colorado cannot allow people to
[SPEAKER_01]: possess or use marijuana for recreational
purposes, and it cannot license stores to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law does not challenge Colorado's
medical marijuana laws or stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: The suit is about one thing, the rule of
the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said
in a news release, release, I said
[SPEAKER_01]: released, geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colorado constitution mandates that
all elected officials, including sheriffs,
[SPEAKER_01]: swear an oath of office to uphold both the
United States as well as the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: constitutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The suit names government governor John
Hickenlooper as the lone defendant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's attorney general, Cynthia
Kaufman, will defend the state against the
[SPEAKER_01]: lawsuit, a spokesman for her said.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lawsuit has the backing of national
anti-legalization groups and its
[SPEAKER_01]: nationwide ambitions were apparent in the
choice of where to announce the suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a news conference Thursday morning at
the National Press Club in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: DC, Smith told reporters that Colorado's
passage of amendment 64 created a
[SPEAKER_01]: constitutional shutdown in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amendment, which voters approved in
2012, made it legal for people over 21 in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado to possess limited amounts of
marijuana and for licensed stores to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that what Colorado has done is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott's Bluff County, Nebraska,
Sheriff Mark Overman, who was also a
[SPEAKER_01]: plaintiff in the suit, said at the news
conference, I believe my fellow plaintiffs
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that this case is going to have
national ramifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we win, then we can reverse what
looks like a surrender to a pro-marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lawsuit follows another legal
challenge filed in December by Nebraska
[SPEAKER_01]: and Oklahoma, which asked the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supreme Court to strike down the
history-making law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two lawsuits filed earlier this year by
the anti-legalization group Safe Streets
[SPEAKER_01]: Alliance on behalf of several Colorado
residents are also pending against the
[SPEAKER_01]: state over amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to the previous lawsuits,
the new suit seeks to close all of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's recreational marijuana stores,
but it also asks a federal judge to
[SPEAKER_01]: overturn amendment 64's protections for
marijuana use and possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law enforcement official's suit
claimed that local officers are breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: federal law and international treaties
when they find marijuana, but they do not
[SPEAKER_01]: seize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Thursday's news conference,
Yuma County Sheriff Chad Day said
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado's marijuana laws now prohibit
officers from seizing marijuana in certain
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances, putting officers,
he said, in an inevitable position.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: By supporting and upholding one,
we're violating the other, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to, at very least,
get an answer from the courts.
[SPEAKER_01]: These cops are not robots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are people and they know what they're
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are acting like we've got
droids out there acting as police officers
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're going to flip their switch and
make their computers crash.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is ridiculous, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam Cayman, I'm probably saying that
wrong, Sam Kay, a law professor at the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Denver was skeptical of the
sheriff's argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said no law requires local officers to
act as de facto federal drug agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the four lawsuits, this is the one with
the least merit, Cayman said.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have targeted not just the marijuana
store regulation piece, but they're also
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially saying Colorado can't legalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has ever gone that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado plaintiffs in the latest lawsuit
include Smith, Day, Elbert County Sheriff
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane Heap, Ennsdale County Sheriff Ronald
Bruce, Kiowa County Sheriff Casey
[SPEAKER_01]: Sheridan, and Delta County Sheriff
Frederick McKee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the six Colorado sheriffs involved in
the lawsuit, only Smith is from a county
[SPEAKER_01]: that approved Amendment 64, with 55% of
86,410 voters approving the measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The measure was approved in 33 of 64
Colorado counties by a 55% margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also named as plaintiffs are three
Nebraska sheriffs, Adam Hayward of Duell
[SPEAKER_01]: County, Mark Overman of Scotts Bluff
County, and John Jensen of Cheyenne
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheyenne County Attorney Paul Schaub of
Nebraska and Sheriff Charles Moser of
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherman, Wallace and Greeley counties in
Kansas also signed the document.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I kind of stumbled on that last
part there, but that was a lot of names is
[SPEAKER_01]: really all.
[SPEAKER_01]: As in the lawsuit filed in Nebraska and
Oklahoma, the law enforcement officials
[SPEAKER_01]: from Nebraska and Kansas are arguing in
the new lawsuit that marijuana flowing out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Colorado post-legalization has led to
more arrests and strain their budgets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to jump in here and say,
so legalize pot in your states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just legalize weed in Nebraska and
Oklahoma and Kansas, and you won't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about arresting more people and
straining your budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to sell cannabis like we do
here in Colorado, and you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: fill up your cash registers at the stores,
and you'll be able to fix your stupid ass
[SPEAKER_01]: roads that you guys have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, let's use our fucking brains,
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, it's actually taking money out
of Sherman County taxpayers' pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burton Pia Nalto, the sheriff in Sherman
County, Kansas said at Thursday's news
[SPEAKER_01]: conference, in January, nine out of the 46
people booked into Sherman County jail
[SPEAKER_01]: were suspected of possessing or
distributing hallucinogenic drugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the category under which marijuana is
classified in Kansas criminal law,
[SPEAKER_01]: according to an online booking log.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two out of the 15 inmates listed on
Thursday as being currently housed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: county jail face charges related to
hallucinogenic drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call cannabis a hallucinogenic drug,
which is right in the same category as
[SPEAKER_01]: probably LSD, mushrooms, ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some cannabis, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny to think that over an invisible
line that this is now a hallucinogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: drug, and you cross this invisible line,
and now it's recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can cross another line,
and it's medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the time and place that we live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado officials have not yet responded
to any of the pending lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previously, state attorneys have argued
that Colorado's more permissive marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: laws, both for medical and recreational
use and sales, do not amount to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, they contend that marijuana
remains illegal in Colorado, aside from
[SPEAKER_01]: the specific exemptions allowed under the
medical and recreational marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Nebraska and Oklahoma filed their
lawsuit against Colorado last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: then Colorado Attorney General John
Suthers said in a statement that it
[SPEAKER_01]: appears the plaintiff's primary grievance
stems from a non-enforcement of federal
[SPEAKER_01]: laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to
choices made by the voters of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mason Tavert, one of the lead proponents
of amendment 64, said if the lawsuits are
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in striking down the measure,
it would lead to a system of marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: chaos, which I would love to see what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to happen, but it'd be
really neat to see how it's dealt with
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are dispensaries on every
other corner in Denver, every other corner
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo West has 12 or 15 dispensaries now
in that small community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be hard to come clean, and they'd
have to go to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have to go to every state that's
got medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't just come here because then
they'd be singling us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Says, this is just another case of the
arrest and prosecution industry teaming up
[SPEAKER_01]: with marijuana prohibition groups to roll
back the progress that has been made in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, he said in a statement Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: US Rep Jared Polin said in a statement
that the US Department of Justice and
[SPEAKER_01]: President Obama have made clear that they
will not interfere with the states whose
[SPEAKER_01]: citizens voted for recreational marijuana
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: This lawsuit is a silly attempt to
circumvent the will of Colorado voters and
[SPEAKER_01]: is a waste of time, Polin's statement
says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, these frivolous lawsuits
will likely continue until we pass my
[SPEAKER_01]: bipartisan Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol
Act and finally end the outdated federal
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these states have filed a suit in their
trying to sue us to shut down our
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational marijuana program because
they can't get cannabis to stop coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into their states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said it the first time,
stop fucking with us and do what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: to make respectable, responsible cannabis
laws in Nebraska and Kansas and Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the states bordering those will
have to follow suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually it'll just be a whole
green map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having a red and blue map,
we'll start having all green states.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another article that I keep
seeing pop up on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding this article on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of my articles from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was written by Christopher Ingraham
from the Washington Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a cute little headline article
here, a headline picture of a little bunny
[SPEAKER_01]: rabbit sitting on a digital scale and the
bunny weighs 93.2 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline says Utah DEA warns of stoned
rabbits if state passes medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: DEA warns of stoned rabbits if state
passes medical marijuana bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you take that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll read the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utah is considering a bill that would
allow patients with certain debilitating
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions to be treated with edible forms
of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the bill passes, the state's wildlife
may cultivate a taste for the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: lose their fear of humans and basically be
high all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's according to testimony presented to
a Utah state panel last week by an agent
[SPEAKER_01]: of the drug enforcement agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I deal in facts, I deal in science at
special agent Matt Fairbanks who's been
[SPEAKER_01]: working in the state for a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a member of the marijuana
eradication team in Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of his colleagues in Georgia recently
achieved notoriety by raiding a retiree's
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and seizing a number of okra
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairbanks spoke of his time eliminating
back country marijuana grows in the Utah
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains, specifically the environmental
costs associated with large scale weed
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation on public land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairbanks said that at some illegal
marijuana grow sites, he saw rabbits that
[SPEAKER_01]: had cultivated a taste for the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He continued,
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true that illegal pot farming can
have harmful environmental consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, nothing about these
consequences is unique to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: If corn were outlawed, the cartels would
start growing it on national forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: The per plant environmental toll would be
about the same, which is kind of a neat
[SPEAKER_01]: fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back county marijuana grows are a
direct result of marijuana's illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: status.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're concerned about the
environmental impact of the grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: an alternative is to legalize and regulate
the plant so that people can grow it on
[SPEAKER_01]: farms and in their gardens rather than on
remote mountainsides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now regarding snowed rabbits, some wild
animals apparently do develop a taste for
[SPEAKER_01]: bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know that the occasional high
rabbit constitutes for grounds for keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana prohibition in place any more
than drunk squirrels are an argument for
[SPEAKER_01]: outlawing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's not even get started on the
nationwide epidemic of catnip abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a time not too long ago when
drug warriors terrified a nation with
[SPEAKER_01]: images of the devil's weed and reefer
madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it seems that enforcers of marijuana
law conjuring up a stone bunny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not scary enough for the Utah state,
it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The panel approved the bill and sent it to
the full Senate where it will be debated
[SPEAKER_01]: this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good luck to Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that this bill passes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you're allowed to consume an
edible form of marijuana outlawing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in your state because the rabbits
are going to get stoned would be a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: like outlawing roads because dogs and
squirrels are going to get ran over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a stupid ass argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come up with something better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't buying that bullshit anymore
because I've got one more news article
[SPEAKER_01]: that I want to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from the toke of the town,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will be the final news article
that I am ever going to read from the toke
[SPEAKER_01]: of the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will tell you why this article comes
from the toke of the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, after five years,
toke of the town says goodbye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 2009, toke of the town has brought
you the biggest marijuana news and the
[SPEAKER_01]: loudest pop views from across the country
and around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the way, we've covered the huge
progress many states have made toward
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and wondered why others are
so far behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: This country still has a long way to go,
but things are looking up and we have our
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers crossed that 2015 will be another
big year for legalization, but the toke
[SPEAKER_01]: won't be around to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least not in its present form.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the toke of the town's final day
of publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was actually written at the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, we're not quitting the
movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just returning the focus of our
marijuana coverage to our local voice
[SPEAKER_01]: media group papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still read William Breed's weekly
pot reviews and ask a stoner column at
[SPEAKER_01]: westward.com where they started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can continue to follow him on
Twitter and on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can keep following toke on
Facebook and Twitter too for the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana news from all of our papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many thanks for reading and supporting us
for the past five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't have covered the marijuana
community without such a strong one
[SPEAKER_01]: reading us, though the community itself is
a strong one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thrown off by the way they worded
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of our archives will remain online
because we wouldn't want you to lose
[SPEAKER_01]: access to our serious reporting on issues
of medicine and our lighthearted coverage
[SPEAKER_01]: of stoner movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light went up for us, won't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a little outdated because this
was put out at the end of the year,
[SPEAKER_01]: the start of this year, at the end of last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The toke of the town is not posting any
more news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to pull a lot of news articles from
there, but I will not have them as a
[SPEAKER_01]: resource anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will miss you toke of the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were a great resource for my little
podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You provided a lot of news articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a dab for you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll miss the toke of the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, that's enough news for
one episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wrap up the show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how far we've been going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting good at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did 31 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know how much time we'd
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's tease some next things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the garden of Weeden will be here
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a phone interview planned with a
cat known as Soil Grown on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil Grown is doing something he calls
Rosentech.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't seen that, we'll talk about
that a little bit on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of Weeden will be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about canopy
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friends Greenworks
who got us started on this canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: management project.
[SPEAKER_01]: On an upcoming episode, we will have
Turpex and Hunt from the Grammy Gatsby to
[SPEAKER_01]: come talk about some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to Colorado Springs to
interview those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, big shout out to FastBerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, FastBerry on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you asked me a couple of questions
today on Instagram, and then you asked me
[SPEAKER_01]: if you were bothering me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, dude, you're not bothering me at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you support all of the
iReGenetics stuff on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you listen to the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never bothering me, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask me more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will use your questions as material for
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear your stuff broadcasted to the
whole world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, dude, you're never bothering me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes for everybody.

[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I ever need new testers for
new seeds, that's the first place I go to
[SPEAKER_01]: look for testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look for your grow photos.

[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 58.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I hope you guys are as dabbed at as
we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to do the big old long
intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to give a big shout out to Kat
and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are high as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of we, what's up, Spence?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, what up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining me across the table is my buddy,
Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He showed up with a mothership rig and a
Pelican case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew we were going to get wrecked as
soon as he walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do one quick ad and then we're going
to get to this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's organic portions of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're brought to you by my good friends at
the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in
Colorado Springs for fresh worm castings,
[SPEAKER_01]: African Nightcrawlers, Red Wigglers,
and all of your organic soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company has
Dragonfly Earth medicine products in stock
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the same worm castings that I
use, the same casting that Spence uses,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same casting that Sean and Jesse use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get them all through www
.rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're in Colorado, visit them at
411 Tijuana Street in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the shit, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned on the music here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always, this podcast is brought to you by
Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Bernd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, big shout out to Spence,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming to the growers meeting
the other night.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of got chaotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't much of a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just smoked too much weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all smoked too much weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should get a board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to prepare something next time
so that it's not just a bunch of smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do a question box.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody has to do a question to have.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you just pick it up and we'll try to
answer whatever questions people have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you listen to the show and you
come to the growers meetings, all you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to do is email me or tweet me and I will
base my next lesson for the growers
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting around some of your questions
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hygro Indoor Growing
Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a Denver location, 6271 Beach
Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, 618 East 4th Street in beautiful
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next time you shop at Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies, tell them you listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast and you
will get commercial pricing on your entire
[SPEAKER_01]: order.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super sweet, super fat deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to save some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence, you had something to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just tried to take a selfie that said
episode 58 and there's a dab right over my
[SPEAKER_07]: camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab life, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you're a dabber if your phone is
sticky and has dabs on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to pick up your car keys and
there's half a dab stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a dab in my beard the other morning
when I woke up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the hell happened there,
but dab life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to give a shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with you taking selfies on the
show?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OG right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: OG, triple, triple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did quick ads because Spence is here and
we're high and I just want to get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to ramble about commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't want to hear a lot of
commercials, but if you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in sponsoring the show,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all of that info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence texted me the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, let's do a podcast,
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, what do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, canopy management.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three minute intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No rambles, no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So canopy management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching Spence follow a guy
named Greenworks on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this will be inspired by our
buddy Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I choked when I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm not allowed to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was odd, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, shout out to Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of inspired Spence to set up some
really killer cage like, not really cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cage is only on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to explain how you did it or
do you want me to keep rambling for you?
All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's essentially a single plant scrog
to where you have, we use bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Greenworks uses 27s.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use it right around 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a 20 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them and they look pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about 22 inches around,
18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even more than 18, maybe about 24
inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are big pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, the pots are two foot tall,
probably easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just, it works for what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about working the surface area
you're given, especially in areas where
[SPEAKER_07]: they limit plant counts.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: That could do a lot of things for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing down the word surface area
because that's a good thing to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, for people with limited plant
counts in Colorado, well in our location,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're definitely messing with plant
counts and we're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow as many plants as we used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Spence has done, he's taken these
giant pots and he takes a plant and he
[SPEAKER_01]: built a PVC sort of a frame around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got a square frame now above the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is that square?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a four by four square cage basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: You build a cage out of your PVC and you
do layers of trellis for support.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not the only one that does it by the
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people that are trying it
because it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's more bang for your buck if
you have, especially it's, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still get good yields,
but you'll get better yields out of
[SPEAKER_07]: strains that are built for that system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gorilla Glue loves it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loves it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bounty killer loves it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: So like those moonshine haze, that haze
plant loves to just grow all inside that
[SPEAKER_07]: net.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's things like that that works.
[SPEAKER_07]: And cookies, they'll do decent,
but not like a Gorilla Glue would do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So essentially it's a four by four cage.
[SPEAKER_07]: With multiple trellises, and then you will
lollipop from the soil to the first
[SPEAKER_07]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everything from that first trellis up
will be just nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naked.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got your frame, you got a
square, and then you put a net over and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you just got, excuse me guys,
I'm choked up from the dabs, but then you
[SPEAKER_01]: just got a bud going through each part of
the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put another screen on to support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it gets out of control,
because it's Gorilla Glue, you got to put
[SPEAKER_01]: another third screen up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need to.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, it's more about canopy
management.
[SPEAKER_07]: Making sure while it's, especially through
the stretch phase from day one to flower
[SPEAKER_07]: till day 21, 22, which when it's growing
like crazy, you want to get in there and
[SPEAKER_07]: really tie them down, make sure they're
not growing out of what they need to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with those trellis nets, I think
they're like three by three squares or
[SPEAKER_07]: four by four squares.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to try to essentially get a nug
or a cola to hit every single one of those
[SPEAKER_07]: squares.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's, I don't know if there's
60 of them on a plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just, you know, the surface area works.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how early in the veg do you start
manipulating the screen?
[SPEAKER_07]: So typically what I do is I'll go from a
one gallon pot or a clone to a one gallon,
[SPEAKER_07]: one gallon to a three.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll let that three kind of get bulky
in that three gallon and then straight
[SPEAKER_07]: into the final pots and then give them,
you know, five, six weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really not as long as people think
it is, especially when it's strain
[SPEAKER_07]: dependent and strains grow, you know,
faster than other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be worth it in the end
because you're going to get the weight in
[SPEAKER_01]: the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once you find your strain, that you
want to use, you know, you basically are
[SPEAKER_07]: training it through the nets.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's getting too tall, throw another
trellis on it, make it go back under the
[SPEAKER_07]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying, it's just,
you can keep bending it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I like to do is I like to just kind
of on your first grid, you kind of spread
[SPEAKER_07]: it open and then you let all the insides
grow up and everything on the outside is
[SPEAKER_07]: going to grow around in the cage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those little shoots that would just
be cut off if you're lollipopping normally
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to grow into actual branches.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're going to grow straight up
into branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the Gorilla Glue, you're going to
get long extended branches out of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I have branches from like the bottom
of the stalk that shoot clear up to the
[SPEAKER_07]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, canopy management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read an article a long time ago that
kind of introduced me to this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article was actually called Growing on
the Grid is what I think it was called and
[SPEAKER_01]: the author was Eric Vixa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to Google that just to make
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he used to be a writer for High Times
and he wrote an article about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm searching his name while I talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm pretty sure that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure because I want to give
you guys a reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's called Growing on the Grid with
Eric Vixa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kind of, if you guys want to read
more about it, this is kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to give you the in action,
in practice sort of talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric Vixa is, he writes a lot so he's
going to give you a really technical
[SPEAKER_01]: explanation on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I'm not sure how many times he's
done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence here has done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you messaging Greenworks?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to get Greenworks to
call in one day and we'll talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, I just actually learned how to
record quality phone interviews using
[SPEAKER_01]: FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably can do it with Skype also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just haven't experimented with that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other night I opened up FaceTime and
played around and I'll be able to record.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want to be on the show and
you're far away, FaceTime is now the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenworks, I'm inviting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of FaceTime, I'm going to get,
I want to talk about this guy in a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of minutes, but I'll talk more about
canopy management.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a phone interview planned with
a guy named Soil Grown from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about his tech here pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got this 20 gallon pot full of
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got, you said you go from a clone
cup into the one gallon pot into the
[SPEAKER_01]: three, and then the three goes into the
20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you top before you transplant into the
20 at all?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really a big topper depending on
strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like for this system, Gorilla Glue,
I don't, it's a plant to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people do top it, but I'm more of
just kind of, you know, working it through
[SPEAKER_07]: the net.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll take one branch and take it all
the way to the left side and take this
[SPEAKER_07]: branch and take it to the right side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And eventually in that system,
it's going to fill itself back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't realize it would work that
extremely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I've got like, if I took my whole
arm and just bent it over, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: just make little shoots and this is just
going to be horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So essentially what you want to do is you,
you know, as your, you know, your colas
[SPEAKER_07]: grow, your nodes stack vertically.
[SPEAKER_07]: They grow together up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you were to bend that branch all the
way down, you'll take in each one of those
[SPEAKER_07]: bud sites, turn them up, which creates
more bud sites on that plant than you
[SPEAKER_07]: would get stacking it together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to, you may not get as
many long colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't get like giant colas,
but you'll get a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all about the space because we're
not trying to grow concrete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to grow all of the space for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes pretty good sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't top it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, see, I would have topped them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I would have fucked up from the
very beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some strains I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gorilla glue is one of the ones I,
it kind of grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plant's wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: It grows by itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll grow with his eyes closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably taunting a lot of people
because a lot of the world can't get their
[SPEAKER_01]: hands on a gorilla glue cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's, there's, you know,
there's some things I would do early in
[SPEAKER_07]: veg, you know, cause you give them a nice,
you know, five, six week veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a couple, two weeks worth of,
you know, fimming and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: training and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, kind of once they,
three weeks before flower, you got to let
[SPEAKER_07]: them heal up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least two weeks, three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite messing with them so that they
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they are a apical dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know which way is up still.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to build up some hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I have like seven questions in my
head and I can't, I was like, ask a
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not gorilla glue, what other
strain do you like to Scrog?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know you've got a killer arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done the white widow this way?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, this, this is my first go at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, I'm blown away and it's,
I'm still learning like the curve.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still picking up the curve,
which is, you know, going from,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, seven and tens up to twenties
and two plants that are two to three times
[SPEAKER_07]: the size, you know, maintenance on those
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you always have to be cleaning up the
bottoms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause imagine, you know, a six foot plant
that's four and a half feet wide.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's no light underneath
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the things like the leaves and stuff
die off just because they don't get light
[SPEAKER_07]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to constantly be in there
picking them off and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that you said that would have been
a six foot tall plant and that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten it down to four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of puts it into a lot of
perspective for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like my, I'm running Gavitas in a
nine foot ceiling room, but it's all about
[SPEAKER_07]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep them down, the light,
the Gavitas will work for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just all about like, in my opinion,
when you, when plants get tall and get
[SPEAKER_07]: close up to the Gavitas, then they kind of
feel how powerful they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you get that canopy, when you get
that canopy management all the way down,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's all about surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, do you have a prediction on how much
weight you're going to pull per thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: watt light with this new system?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, right now per thousand watt,
I'll probably pull on my first go,
[SPEAKER_07]: probably six, 700 grams per Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's over a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pound and a quarter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A pound and a half if it comes back right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll be a pound and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's only in a 4K.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm running a 4K Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a six week veg, that's not bad at
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plants really grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when you put them from a three gallon
pot into a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've seen the stalks of your plants
and they're bigger around than these
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone stands.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're almost as big as my arms and I'm
not that big.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're wrist size for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your rooms look great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been in there in a few days or
so, but I've been there recently and they
[SPEAKER_01]: look pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Big Mike, Matty, Michael,
everybody that keeps the gardens on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else helps over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Tater comes over.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up cousin Tater?
Phil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we can't forget Phil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get Phil on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Phil is really the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: He raps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phil raps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we can let him come rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can do all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw up a beat and let Phil rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: He raps better than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring Phil and Slop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do some raps together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are invited on the show boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to this, Michael,
Big Mike, Slop, Phil, Matty, you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: always welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you want to do a podcast,
just text me and say, it's podcast time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do a live podcast at the cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't do it like live broadcasting,
but we can record from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: What if I have a house and all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I talked about taking my recording
equipment to the cup and just taking it to
[SPEAKER_01]: my hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bring it to my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bring it to your house and we can do
it up there and record people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call cool people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guy, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come podcast with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cool guys, you want to come get on my
show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you guys are going to be,
this is not set in stone, but if you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be in the Denver area during
the cannabis cup and you're down with
[SPEAKER_01]: spits and you want to take a dab with
Rasta Jeff and the Garden of Weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: crew, there's a good chance I will bring
some, maybe not this big old setup,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I might bring some small recording
gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want this to disappear while I'm
at the cup or something from the car or
[SPEAKER_01]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my livelihood, so I'd be crushed
without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this gear, some kind of recording gear
may end up at the... I've got my phone,
[SPEAKER_01]: if nothing else, that works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a podcast or let's at least hang
out at the cannabis cup, you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: and take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This show won't come out for probably a
week from tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the middle of March when this
comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's meet up the cannabis cup,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have some Jeff's OG dabs if
Spence is down to blast it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let him do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No diggity.
[SPEAKER_01]: No diggity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about canopy management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we got a lot of that covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not going to do the Scrogs,
you can lollipop really heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another good way to make space for
what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get down on your knees and see how far the
light is getting into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you don't see any light hitting
those leaves, just clean that shit off
[SPEAKER_01]: from the bottom there because there's no
light getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a waste of space.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also other ways of canopy
management.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do staking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do lots of staking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly do both.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the Scrog system, but I still like
the old school look going in a room and
[SPEAKER_07]: being a hundred stakes deep in there and
it's like, oh Lord.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how Dread over at River Rock does
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk through there, it's Stake
Central.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys got all the wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stake City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got wood for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like some stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to grow tall plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a seven gallon pot and I veg them
until they're about three and a half feet
[SPEAKER_01]: tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they end up six feet tall by the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That requires either a tomato cage or some
staking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the staking because I can pull it
apart and I can support each nug in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can kind of do what you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just surface area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically train it to like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This cola's got this section.
[SPEAKER_07]: This cola's got this section.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to kind of feel as many sections
as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about what kind of
genetics you're using, like you were
[SPEAKER_01]: saying the golden goat or the gorilla glue
makes a whole bunch of heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat will make a whole bunch of
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies doesn't really like to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe grow a whole bunch of small
cookies plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just if you can do a bunch of two
foot tall, three foot tall cookies plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to go with the plant like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to see a green again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do a bunch of small ones instead of
one giant plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the genetics and canopy
management, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still need fans when you're doing all
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: People forget about airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't stress enough about airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody just told me they had powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't figure out how to beat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're asking what to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, don't spray something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a dehumidifier and clean out the air
in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're simple stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cut all that shit off if you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cut all that bog shit down.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I see any bad shit it's going bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else you got about canopy management?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about something
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Canopy management.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about the levels of your
lights during flower to help in early or
[SPEAKER_07]: the first couple of weeks of flower?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you keep them lower?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you keep them further away?
[SPEAKER_01]: My lights don't move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll put my plants on a five
gallon bucket to get them higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the duration of the grow of my
plant, my lights don't move.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tall and I hate moving the lights down
where I hit my head on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep them as high as they'll go in the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I do is I don't change out from
the halides to the sodiums for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stay blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they don't stretch as far.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I do the switch, I see them start to
bulk up right away at the two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of doing that extra week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think that that helps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have stopped doing- Do you veg with blue
lights?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably that change from blue to HPS
gives them a time span.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got to get used to that shit real
quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do dark periods before flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about to say I've stopped doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't find it useful really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to veg under 24 hours and then I
would veg for 24 and then go dark for 24
[SPEAKER_01]: and then start my flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed it would trigger a little more
quickly, but it's not enough time to do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let my plants do their thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, I just feel like when I
go ... I go 18 to 6 and then into flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually, when they sleep, they're ugly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just sleeping.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not the prettiest person when I'm
asleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually, when the lights come back on,
they get into the swing of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before the lights cut off, they'll start
going back down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when I usually hit that 48 hours
dark, as soon as I go in the rooms,
[SPEAKER_07]: even when it's dark, they're already
praying and ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like they're just preparing
themselves for the time change.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're excited for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy how the plants will be veg
looking and then that dark period and you
[SPEAKER_07]: go in there and it's like, oh shit,
they're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants tell us what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, don't be afraid to try a different
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother plants run on a 19.5 cycle
recommended by DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best performance I've ever had
from a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to experiment with some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I do 18 to 6 in my veg areas and then
my flower, I just go straight 12 to 12
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't do the dark period.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do 12 to 12.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dark period is the only thing I do,
just start flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best herb I've ever grown was
actually grown under a single hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a five by five hydro hut with a 600
watt high pressure sodium and a 400 watt
[SPEAKER_01]: metal halide in the same bulb and that
grozilla bulb that Hydrofarm makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The double bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had great flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my best pictures came from that
run of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely quality buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: My best grow of that headband cut ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you dabbing over there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the dude that- Dude,
the bounty killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about Greenworks for a
minute or not Greenworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I wrote it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I keep your soil grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many of these new Instagram
names that I can't keep up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be on top of all the social
media, but there's so many things going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have something that you want
to hear about canopy management that we
[SPEAKER_01]: missed, remind me because we went quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still more to talk about,
but we're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done enough on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about some new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you hear that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that's a mothership rig right
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little mothership mini with the
swing arm, mothership carb cap on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bounty killer live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life doesn't get much better than that,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look on Spence's face proves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that he knows where he is
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your eyes, your hoodie, and the microphone
cover are all the same shade of red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just letting you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to drive home like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been calling it Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whichever way you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spelled R-O-S-I-N, so we can't argue
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it first on Instagram from a dude
named Soyl called at Soyl Drone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude, what do you think, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to give away too much of his
tech because we're going to have him here
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will gladly support somebody trying
something new, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: No doubts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was listening to Hash Church today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hash Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't freak out on me because I say this
because people argue about it all the
[SPEAKER_07]: time, but it's the first non-solvent.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no water.
[SPEAKER_07]: As much as you don't believe it,
it's a solvent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the butane and propane, those are all
solvents, but he's just using pure heat to
[SPEAKER_07]: extract oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't use heat as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all he's doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the picture of the whole slab
he posted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw one that's rolled up in a worm
around a car cab.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hit a giant one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was as big as his face.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been going in lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a scheduled phone interview with
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said Tuesday or Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hasn't confirmed a specific time,
but we're going to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably just piece that right into
this episode, you guys, if I can get him
[SPEAKER_01]: to call me on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll throw that into this show,
probably right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an interview, maybe, hopefully,
with Soyl Drone.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for pulling some time away from
your work to join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I'm just going to... I know you're a
busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to get right to it and
start asking a couple of quick questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, can you explain to me a
little bit about what Rosentec is and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you got the idea?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosentec, I think that comes from somebody
named Compassion that I guess was on
[SPEAKER_04]: ICNAG.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does a Rosentec with a no-melt hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you take your hash, your no-melt,
and you can turn it into a melt by pulling
[SPEAKER_04]: all the resin out of the no-melt with a
double boiler, a bowl, and your no-melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did this different method.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess what rosin is, is technically it's
just a form of resin obtained from my
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why it's called rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I know rosin has was for both
strings, for friction, so you can get...
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know where the term actually
stuck in cannabis, but that's where I know
[SPEAKER_04]: it's from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really kind of related to resin
in a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way I got my idea, I mean,
it came from basically... I'm a hash bean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm running out of my melt,
so I decide I need to figure something
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all this no-melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember back then, selected Nicky T
put something on the IG about taking a
[SPEAKER_04]: flat iron just for pressing, just to press
out your hash much simpler than heating up
[SPEAKER_04]: a wand or doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get the right temp just to press
it out and have a proper press dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I used to take my wife's hair curler
and I would... Sometimes I'd get it too
[SPEAKER_04]: hot by accident.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would notice that it would separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see the oil and then the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't think anything... This was a
while back, so I didn't think anything of
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just pull the parchment back up
and now I have a pressed patty that was
[SPEAKER_04]: over pressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, with too much heat, but otherwise
it was some pressed hash.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made it smokable?
[SPEAKER_04]: Made it better?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I made it a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many years ago do you think that was?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was only not too long ago,
maybe about two years ago.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably about two years ago when I did
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just doing like the Frenchy text,
anything that didn't know, I would triple
[SPEAKER_04]: press it, try to increase the melt quality
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some stuff didn't, some stuff did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what gave you the idea to just start
pressing straight buds without trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: hash in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once I ran out of my no-melt,
all my no-melt and drained it into the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom and smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just took... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just sitting here smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoke flour, but my thing is dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more for the experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sitting here bullshitting with my
father-in-law and I'm like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's try this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grabbed the nugget.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it in between the parchment just
like I would a rolled up ball of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my surprise resin squeezed out of the
bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were both in shock, like no way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I scooped up the oil, did it again,
scooped it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was enough on the end, looked like a
dab, but we tried it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to my surprise, melted to nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes even good BHO will leave a
residue sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got lucky figuring that one out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would call it luck for way to say it,
but I mean, if I didn't do what I did,
[SPEAKER_04]: like if I didn't stay here and smoke like
I do every day and I went so much into the
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate aspect of cannabis,
I wouldn't be the one to strike the luck.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect for putting in the work,
for putting in the time to get to that and
[SPEAKER_01]: for loving the extracts as much as you do
to find that for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it seems to be the thing now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're blowing up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I posted it, I really didn't expect
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it'd be like, you know,
something some of these ash makers could
[SPEAKER_04]: utilize for all their no-no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then once I started posting up the
flower, I was just thinking, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some people would be like, you know,
in awe about it, but I didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, can you tell me just kind of a brief,
I know it's just a pretty simple process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me kind of briefly how you do
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would say it's probably the most
simplest process of extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say if you want to do it,
the most basic way to do it for anybody at
[SPEAKER_04]: home is just grab your, grab your lady's
flat iron or hair straightener,
[SPEAKER_04]: get the widest one you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Digital settings would be optimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, I mean, when I first did it,
I had it up to 420 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the turpines were, I wasn't
worried about, I was, I wanted turpines,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I wanted that now, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So to my surprise, I was pulling melts
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that I've fine tuned it a little
bit, and there's going to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: evolving to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just in the beginning stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, fine tuning, it's tough to
get those turps out of it, but... So you
[SPEAKER_01]: just get the straightening comb or the
flat iron and then just basically put some
[SPEAKER_01]: parchment in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you put it between the parchment and
then put it between the flat iron.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do it in a quick process as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it between that flat iron and then
press it as hard as you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: press it as hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just got to practice and waste a
couple of buds, but it doesn't look like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing a lot of buds at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not too big of a deal to waste a
couple of nuggets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do the hair straightening anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I do the press now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you doing big things now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm still, I have a lot of other
plans for something to make it a more
[SPEAKER_04]: efficient process, but right now this
seems to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can fine tune this to make it
workable, then whatever goes on after,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just going to be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep improving every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way this industry is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing anything special to prepare
the buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like them a little moist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like them dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like them crispy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like them cured?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say a properly grown, well cured bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I would look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is too dry, works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that might have a little too
much moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably will work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had too much like a trial with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had like fresh nugs and I haven't had
too many results with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing to be ecstatic about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's better to let the moisture come
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it dry up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how the moisture is going to
affect the extract, whether we see it or
[SPEAKER_04]: not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see how it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, moisture, heat, and resonance
just somehow trapping in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like when you're affecting some not
properly dried IWE, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_04]: trapping moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can see that being the same for this
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do certain strains work better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do like Indica's or Sativa's work better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a favorite strain that works
the best for making rosin?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I'm finding that Indica's are
producing, they're having the most rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've even had some real frosty
Sativa's.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're only putting out like eight to
nine percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've had some Indica's pull around
anywhere from like nine to 22 percent,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's getting up there with the BHO
pulls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it really depends on how much time
and effort you want to put into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to sit there and do it as
.1, I mean, you want to break the blood
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're doing it in a whole gram,
you're probably not going to get the
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: On big scale, it might suffice because
it's going to be how efficient the process
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So break it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more broken up, the better actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does the flavor of a rosin dab compare
to like a BHO dab or a solventless dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you still getting good flavors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to send in some of these
samples for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to be one of my next
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask if you've had anything
tested or if anybody that you know has had
[SPEAKER_01]: it tested yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually foundation extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody else had some actually
hash bars tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like it was pretty high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted up the results on my IG page with
the results from foundation extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was like 83 percent THC and
eight percent terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just guessing that it was made off of
a hair straightener, you know?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little bit less control on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen any hatred from all the BHO
people, the guys that spent thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars on equipment and now you're just
doing it with a shirt press?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I've seen a little bit of
hate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it's more of like on the down
side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are down low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are kind of burnt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then most of the time, there is a lot
of people are just like, just not giving
[SPEAKER_04]: it a chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, you know, like I'll see them,
I'll see some of these people like
[SPEAKER_04]: changing their minds about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're trying it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they try it, it's like, you can't
knock it till you try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how this industry works though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this industry is kind of quirky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make decisions right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just how the way the world,
it's the way the world works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, when you do that,
you're going to be the one to miss out on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you ever get a chance,
anybody that's listening, if you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance, take a dab of some rosin before
you diss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try the rosin tech yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a hater.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it similar to a normal dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd say it's strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would compare it more to like a IWE or
like a hash dab rather than a BHO dab to
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get that heavy chested feeling like
you do sometimes from a water dab or an
IWE?
[SPEAKER_01]: IWE dab, do you get that heavy chested,
like thick feeling sometimes?
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, it's the smoothest dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be in Denver for the
cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still not 100% sure about the Denver
cup, but we're going to most likely be in
[SPEAKER_04]: Chalice this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you were at the Denver cup,
you better find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to test the rosin tech for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll definitely link them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make that worth our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think you're going to enter any
contests or any cups or anything like that
[SPEAKER_01]: anytime soon, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the next cup going on that we're
going to enter is Chalice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're setting up for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to prepare for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to put rosin tech in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely going to see some solvent
with heat extracted oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm hoping to have some iFlex in
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see what the rosin tech
does up next to iSwax and also up next to
[SPEAKER_01]: BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll probably make a category for it by
the time that the event happens,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm still excited to see it in
competitions.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I see it, it's non-solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't they throw the clear in that
category?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in that category.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be competing, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be right up there with those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have faith in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen, people are loving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact is, there's natural 13s,
whether it went through heat, the process
[SPEAKER_04]: that it went.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just can't forget that it's solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not big on smoking solvent extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that's in my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not against it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some very enjoyable extracts from
solvents, but my preferred smoke is
[SPEAKER_04]: solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people seem to be turning
that way lately too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I see the clean meds movement
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely picking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for supporting the clean meds
movement, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more people like yourself that are
aware of what we're doing for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community and to our bodies and with our
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it and respect it a lot,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all for it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm going to wrap up this phone
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you I'd only take about 15 minutes
of your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting pretty close to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can people find you on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: On Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at Soil Grown on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or hashtag Soil Grown Tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't really do too much of the
hashtag for the Soil Grown Tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'll find, you'll see the Soil
Grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just type in Rosentech and you'll
definitely find Soil Grown somewhere in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Search for Rosentech on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll definitely find this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any shout outs or anything you
want to give or anything you want us to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at since you've got a lot of people
listening to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something you want to say to the world?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just say, don't knock it until you
try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remember that it's clean meds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And although it's a simple extraction
process, it does take a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would call it a connoisseur's extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: Connoisseur's concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I truly appreciate you calling in
for the show, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever have anything else you want to
say on the show, you've got my phone
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Denver, I look forward to
meeting you at the cup, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for giving me a shot, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for talking to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being on the show, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go take a dab of some Rosentech for me and
I'll take a dab of some Turbex BHO for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this dude, yeah, you just heard what
he said, hopefully, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fun way to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Spence is heating me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these bounty killer live resin dabs
off the mothership.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not be able to talk for a couple
of seconds because Spence likes to wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grabbing the dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence holds onto the rig for a little bit
of time because he knows I like to take
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs that are too hot, which we call
glowies in this crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not even like super glows,
but it's just hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like the way I get the dab when it's
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clunk is just smacking this mothership rig
on the table like it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's me getting super high right now
is what that sound is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sound of my brain is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like bubble wrap and fireworks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pop rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain feels like pop rocks is what I'm
going to say next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of the rosin tape?
[SPEAKER_01]: That tastes really good, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's using equipment that everybody has.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people use flat iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think black people call that a pressing
comb, don't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the same thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: A hot comb?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: On one show that you're on, I said you're
the only black person that's been in my
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Southern California,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had all kinds of black folks on my
block.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one girl, Letitia, she called it
a flat iron or a straightening comb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the same shit,
but never mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: A flat iron?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these guys are using shit that's
around the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Adam Hand from Handmade Apparel,
he showed me his, he posted his slab
[SPEAKER_01]: because of course he had a t-shirt press
already and he's like, I got this game
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out and he's winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm amazed that they're using shit
that is just kind of around the house and
[SPEAKER_01]: making earl, you know, solventless hash
that is dabble blood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I lied.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it has more something to do
with the moisture content of how your weed
[SPEAKER_07]: is dried.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like weed down here is really dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just maybe I needed to do more
pressure or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk to him here in a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully by the time this airs,
we've got his part to piece in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you actually know because that
Rosentech is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if just, I'm going to talk about it
because I wanted to save and let him talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, but maybe we won't get his
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude's taking a t-shirt press and
he's modified it and he puts a layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: parchment paper, a little layer of buds
and another parchment paper and squishes
[SPEAKER_01]: it for about four seconds and lifts it up,
pulls the parchment out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got it pretty much earl.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, slides the weed off into the floor
and stomps on it all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's pretty much got good hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen some dude who has a tea jar and
just once he's done with it, he makes tea
[SPEAKER_07]: in the morning with it because it's still-
Still got stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't get it all out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to at Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he called in and did that interview,
extra super huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he didn't, still check him out on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Soil Grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the Rosentech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really, really cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I'm going through my notes,
here, I have to give a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Judy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Judy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm coughing from that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one more thing to talk about that I
have to remind you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prizes have been shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember we did prizes from episode 50?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those have been shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two people never gave me their addresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those prize winners were from
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys go on Facebook and give me your
address if you want your prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have until the next episode airs to
claim your prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those prizes are not claimed,
they will be sacrificed to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: gods and recycled for future episode
prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else you got on your brain,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's things been, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're even curling your ass off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, just getting ready for ... We're
going to go on a cup tour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Denver's our first one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we're going to do Oregon and possibly
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stretching out far.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the smaller ones, and they
accept out-of-state cards, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Seattle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seattle's fun, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the weather in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's off the chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got family there, don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so shout out to the family in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food is slamming.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I'm going to start traveling to more
of these cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a solo grower, so I don't have
anybody backing up my grow when I go,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's hard to get away for three or four
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that third day, you start stressing.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I had to go to Vegas for the C cup,
man, I was like, oh my God, I need to go
[SPEAKER_07]: home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody take me home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just go for some light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get there, check on the plants,
and then I'll fly back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to walk in the room,
make sure that everything's alive one
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me, guys, what do you do when you go
out of town and you grow pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you keep your plants alive when you
go out of town?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's your strain you're working on going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before you came over tonight,
I was at the grow space taking pictures of
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 different phenotypes of black cherry
Kim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've narrowed it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one that is definitely a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the great bud structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like purple Laffy Taffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a weird, and you can smell it
from far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a weird overpowering aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laffy Taffy's are slimy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like grape Laffy Taffy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a coincidence I'm black, and I don't
like grapes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't going there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do like Laffy Taffy's.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're slimy, so that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the smell, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can open a pack of Laffy Taffy and
smell it before you eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked in the room, and I could smell
that one plant all the time, so I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: single it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this little bitch right here
is going to be a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she happened to be one of the best
purple phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She grows a nice top cola, nice structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to use that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's one that's a little
lighter purple, but has more of a chem-dog
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's going to be an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one with no purple at all,
but tons of trike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of trikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a great chem-y, kind of funky,
cherry, resin-y kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those three or four females are going
to get put in the room with the black
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry male, along with I got a couple
other girls that are going to go in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I even want to say what
girls are going in there on the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I got some great strain ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some new black cherry
crosses coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That breeding project won't happen until
probably mid-summer, maybe after the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer heat kind of kills some ideas
around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to shut down some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I've got a reversed golden goat
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a female that's now a male in a room
with some lemon skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more lemon Jeffrey being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more golden goat seeds being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm creating Sunshine Girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also put gorilla glue in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have, yeah, gorilla glue golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need a name for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be kind of tight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even like golden goat weed,
but that might be tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I cross anything to golden goat,
it makes it more resin-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gorilla glue is already resin-y
already, so it's going to be neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a plant in there,
a headband plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've told this story before,
the last time I pollinated a headband
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It died.
[SPEAKER_01]: It died, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put that bitch in there again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're going to see if it just had a
bad day or if there's something to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't know what I did last time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every other plant was happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: She wasn't fucking with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't take that bukkake very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, or no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just shriveled up, shriveled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got any shout-outs you want to give to
anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're about to take a dab, and I hit you
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wasn't going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say shout-out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big Mike, Michael, Sloppy, Fong,
Phil, Taylor, Stephanie, Sorak,
[SPEAKER_07]: Nani, Seda, King, Earl.
Earl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, these guys have- My mom and my
daddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sweetest.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's Earl?
[SPEAKER_01]: Remind me what kind of, I can't think of
what he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a beardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to call him a hornytoe,
but he's a bearded dragon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, he looks like a- Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks like a dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you guys got him, he was like micro-
He's like a thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like a thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like the size of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: His head to tail was the size of my thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he's like the length of my arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dude looks crazy now.
[SPEAKER_07]: He looks like a fucking- He sits in his
cage like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get you.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's one of the only reptiles that when
you say his name, he'll turn and look at
[SPEAKER_07]: you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like you can hear his name.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a snake.
[SPEAKER_07]: She kicks it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Earl is on my side.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a picture of a booty in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'd be up there scratching the booty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Garden of Whedon house is definitely
one of the funnest places to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what's going to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chaotic, but they got the hookups
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all comfy and chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoker's Club.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be doing a booth at the cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Garden of Whedon Smoker's Club booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be hanging out a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a good time, so enjoy 420
and come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's going to be mad at me because
I'm going to be out of seeds by the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the first day of the Canvas Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I get to Denver, I'll be there
Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of Friday night, I could be out
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to buy mine before the Cup even
starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a box over here with some Irish
stickers all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what's in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do owe a big, huge shout out to Green
and Healthy Cannabis in Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for the Turfex on the
low, low cheap, they've got the Durbin
[SPEAKER_01]: Poison Wax that is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't even hype you up on that
because by the time you get there,
[SPEAKER_01]: that Durbin will be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have some brand new shit that'll
be even better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he just tag us in some?
[SPEAKER_01]: He tagged us in a lot of shit,
yeah, because they love us.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the drop happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what day is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new drop Saturday of new good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every few days, they get new drops of
great, great medicine over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green and Healthy Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 212 21st Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's South 21st.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pull up the track.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want the address?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: 212 South 21st Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you're in Denver, if you're in
Pueblo, if you are, what's west of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountains, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in those mountains, if you're in
Manitou Springs, if you're in what's to
[SPEAKER_01]: the east, that's just the Plains.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're out there on the Plains,
if you're in Payton, if you're up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Diamond Dave's neighborhood, shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No shout out, negative shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No shout out at all for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you're in that area, go to Green
and Healthy Cannabis and get yourself some
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpax medicine on the cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't rep other dispensaries very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green and Healthy Cannabis, that's where
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the Terpy Boys are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be on, I think they'll be
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going up there Thursday to record with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ahead of myself because an episode
came out today and then I've got one
[SPEAKER_01]: prerecorded and then I've got this one and
then I'll have Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get fucking awesome here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have shows coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, I think the show I did last week,
I'll put it out on a Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a Wednesday show this
week, or last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have a special edition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen the Colbert report?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's one, I think it's Keane Peele
maybe, but he was doing a black Colbert
[SPEAKER_07]: report and they were talking about
Ferguson and it was fucking hilarious,
[SPEAKER_07]: dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was probably some funny shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ain't going to talk about it,
but it was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys got to watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, what's your guys name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bung Lao?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bung Lao.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bung Lao.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say Bung Lao because they're Jo
Koy does a character called Bung Lao,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got them confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on YouTube, type in Russell,
phone pranks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of the fucking name of the
show right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to Google it because it's
worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy deserves a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He entertained me the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, he is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Fong, too, because Fong is
where I originate all my Asian voices
[SPEAKER_07]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so what's going there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Onage pranks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Onage pranks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy kills it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're bored, you got some time to
kill, check out YouTube, check out Onage
[SPEAKER_01]: pranks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the ones with Tyrone in them are
fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all one guy doing all those voices.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls people and harasses them,
but he does call and apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's not a total dick, but that's my
recommendation for the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done a recommendation for the
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess now that I've said that,
I'm going to have to recommend something
[SPEAKER_01]: every fucking week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend a mother shit next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the week after that, Vector
Torches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the week after that, Root Beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root Beer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the week after that, we're going
to go with the G-Nail from Emotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's plenty of recommendations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Emotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be long enough for you to
forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Giddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the E-Nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need one for my car, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have one with like a power
converter that plugs into the mini that
[SPEAKER_01]: can plug into the dash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with a suction cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a radio attachment?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cigarette lighter hookup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to do a dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to do the closing part of
the show right after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, that was a big chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say something interesting, Spence.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really an interesting person,
but I'm nice with a carb cap, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad it's what I need from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy likes to give me big fat nasty
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows how I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even like big dabs either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's why I do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't like them, so I make other
people do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop rocks in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I remembered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my brain is sticky now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap it up
because I'm super duper high, like level
[SPEAKER_01]: 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, I'm going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't going to fall over or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already in a chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you played Destiny?
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be what everybody's hooked
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you like those sports games,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I like basketball, football, but recently
I've been playing Grand Theft Auto.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuckin' shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Five stars cruising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Tony, if you have my Grand Theft Auto
five minutes, let me get that back because
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got inspired.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can play online.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an Xbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can't be bros online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to play PlayStation Play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence kills it on the basketball game,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody at the house can beat him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all pissed off at him every time I
go over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, that's a lie.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a lie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Football.
[SPEAKER_07]: I win football.
[SPEAKER_01]: The UFC one is fun to watch you guys play,
too, because I think someone's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: break your controller one day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have almost... That's why my mind's
broke right now because I've like slammed
[SPEAKER_01]: it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I can't take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke more weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get so stressed out over the video
games, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: End of the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the gym, the fitness.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys have been killing it with their
fitness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that on another episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next episode, let's talk about some
healthy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we don't always have to talk about
just weed because this is part of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think good care of my plants has taught
me to take better care of me, and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: said that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, thanks again for listening to
another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep saying we're going to wrap it up,
but we're going to dab the fuck out,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can go as long as I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back in a few more days.
