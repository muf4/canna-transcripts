[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we got all the business out of
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's settle in and hang out and chat a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you on a super warm day here
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me the idea that it is time to
get the outdoor stuff going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been excited about the outdoor
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may know that I do a little
bit of a breeding project in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent part of today making selections
for that outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have chosen my male plant for my outdoor
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have chosen most of the ladies that I
want to put out there and in the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: days those ladies will be put,
those ladies and gentlemen will be put in
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse and I am very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the greenhouse crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you are ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say I hope you guys are
ready, but it's guys and gals at the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are ready for another kick ass
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't tell, making selections for
outdoor got me hyped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me excited for the outdoor season
for summer to get out there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and play, get a sunburn,
get some sun on my face again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a great summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you the plants that
I have chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants I'm going to put outside
just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: In future episodes that will come to light
that information will be revealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready to tell anybody yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be excited once you start hearing
the details of what I'm putting outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough chatter here at the start of
the show talking about the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great email here in front of me
from a person with a very creative name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a bit of a recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a previous episode, probably three,
maybe four episodes ago, I did a talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about reversing female plants to make them
give us pollen so we can make feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people had a great response to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people had a great, a lot of
great questions and feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions and comments and
pieces of feedback I received the most was
[SPEAKER_00]: can we or could we or may we or what
happens if we attempt to reverse a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we take a male plant, treat it with a
solution and turn it into a female to
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly see what that female plant,
that male plant would look like as a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people asked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people had a lot of great
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have an email here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use that as a pivot point,
as a segue to discuss reversing a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to have it show female sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it says the last podcast got me
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know obviously two dude plants rubbing
wieners together won't make anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, is it possible to ask one or are
one cross a male using STS?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking it would be an excellent
way to somewhat preserve genetics of a
[SPEAKER_00]: breed or male and make some meninized or
masculinized seeds or even see what type
[SPEAKER_00]: of female traits the male offers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is even possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this only work for females?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just an overthinking stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to hear from you or catch this on a
podcast one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love from our friend, Joe Jizz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy, Joe Jizz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really thought I'd say that on the
show, but big up for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to hear from you or catch this on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here you are, Mr. Jizz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to answer your question in
detail here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reverse a male plant to show us its
potential as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we would do that is exactly
what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see its potential as a female,
which would show me what it will deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: to my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take this male plant, turn it into a
girl, I've got a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good idea of what the girl
offspring are going to look like as
[SPEAKER_00]: usable, smokable buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a completely different structure,
a completely different idea, a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to take that male plant and turn
it into a girl and see what it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally wouldn't do it to show me
what that plant possibly may look like as
[SPEAKER_00]: a female because in my theory,
in my opinion, in the time it would take a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower to reverse a male plant and turn it
to female, I could have grown the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and put pollen on a true female and
just made a bunch of seeds and then grow
[SPEAKER_00]: those and actually have real viable seeds
that will show me what the progeny looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like instead of reversing the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes nearly the same amount of time
except I have seeds I have to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's more fun to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get seeds at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just get one reversed plant that I
can't really do anything with because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to smoke it or consume it
because it's been treated and it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to show me potentially what it
would look like as a female, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a little bit wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell that something
happened to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll still have an Adam's apple or wide
shoulders or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know, but it will give you an idea
of what it's going to look like as a
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will work, but in the time it's
going to take you to reverse that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already grown out my male pollinated
females and I'm growing out the seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what my breeding project is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already a step ahead of the person who
didn't waste time doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that we would do it is now
making male seeds or masculine or
[SPEAKER_00]: meninized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't really interest me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to preserve a breed or
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that in a batch of seeds,
there'll be males or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know if I've got all females,
I can make a male out of that or a pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donor out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not something that gets my
attention, but it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a viable option for somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an avenue that I want to explore,
but it is something that could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make an S1 or R1 cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about, I've got some notes
here on the computer that I want to jump
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you reverse the male, it shows it
as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said kind of, it gives an idea of its
potential, but it only shows what it will
[SPEAKER_00]: look like as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't show what it's going to do in a
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see what it looks like as a
female, but that doesn't show what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to pass if we do breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there's this trait and
this trait as a female and we know that it
[SPEAKER_00]: will express that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we breed it to other plants,
how much of that stuff moves over?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of that carries?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of that is shared into the
offspring?
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, I feel like if I just
pollinated and grew out the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting much more progress,
much more details, much more info,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more data, because now I know,
I always talk about when I pollinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: I rarely use a male to pollinate one
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, if I'm using a boy,
he's going to pollinate at least four,
[SPEAKER_00]: six, maybe nine or 10 different girls,
because when I grow the seeds from those
[SPEAKER_00]: nine or 10 different girls, I can see what
that male is doing amongst a different
[SPEAKER_00]: population of different female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I cross, let's say I take a lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to pick lemon because
lemons are very easy to work with flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lemon male and cross it to a
strawberry female, a blueberry female,
[SPEAKER_00]: a chocolate female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see lemon come out of all
these crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see a blend of lemon,
strawberry, lemonade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want lemon blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want lemon chocolate or chocolate lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that lemon to wash over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what the lemon is
contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mix it to a lot of different
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour that lemon juice on a lot of other
things, taste it, see what works best.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I only cross it to one thing,
I can see that it got this and this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is that a one-time thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that an anomaly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it actually passes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it play well with others?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it get along with just that one
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that by actually doing the
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reversal is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows you a lot of cool shit,
but we don't see what it does as breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a lot of details,
but it's not as effective as I would want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to be for the amount of time,
effort, energy, and expense which it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: me to do that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making a plant reverse and show its
potential probably takes longer than
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding it and growing out those seeds
from multiple females is what I wrote in
[SPEAKER_00]: my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just covering the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I get all the stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should definitely cover and
talk about is we're doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: different when we're reversing,
when we are attempting to reverse the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant compared to when we were reversing
the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we need a different solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do basically the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are making fems, we want to stop
the ethylene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're reversing a female to make it a
male or reversing a male to make it a
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm even getting confused on all this
new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The future is weird, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're making fem seeds, we want to
stop the ethylene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're doing the opposite,
we want to encourage and promote that
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene production and do things a little
bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a different chemical or a different
solution for this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a chemical or a product called
Ethafon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spelled E-T-H-A-P-H-O-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethafon is what I believe the chemical is
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that product to reverse the male
plant to show its female sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product that you would buy is called
Ethafon 2SL.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're shopping, if you're going to do
it, that's the product you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I go with my rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to play with any
chemicals, if you're going to apply any
[SPEAKER_00]: products, read the labels, read the
manuals, read the safety data sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also after that, wear all of the
recommended and required personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get hurt, if you get sick,
if you go blind, if you fuck up and do
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong, I am not responsible for
your dip shittery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you right now, read the
fucking label, wear the protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hurt yourself, make yourself sick,
fuck up some plants, have a bad time,
[SPEAKER_00]: not my fault, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, read the label,
do shit correctly, do shit carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're mixing, when you're applying,
have gloves, have goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it recommends anything else,
wear that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were spraying the plant,
remove that one plant from the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, put it in a safe place,
spray the one plant, wait till it dries,
[SPEAKER_00]: then put that plant back in the rest of
the environment or you will run the risk
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting the other plants a reversal
spray on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those other plants didn't sign up for a
sex change, let's not do that to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the product you want is Ethafon 2SL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful when you were using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply it to the plant is to where it's
dripping off, but not fucking soaking off
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it kind of saturated,
but you don't want it raining off because
[SPEAKER_00]: then too much of it falls off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to stay on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly consider using a wedding agent,
a sticker, a spreader sticker to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the plant a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't just spray the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray the stems and the stalks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the plant fully wet with the Ethafon
2SL spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about dilutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use very little, too much of this stuff
and the plants go and they just start
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting up and they start getting weird
crazy arms and they start showing you that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you start with approximately a
one to 100 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, one milliliter of Ethafon
2SL to 199 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do one and a hundred milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one to a 100 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even a half or 0.7 of a milliliter
if you can measure that small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a device to measure that
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you quantify it, go bigger,
do a lot of water and then more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethafon so you could do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: But about half to one milliliter per
hundred milliliters of water is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than that and the plants will get
pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough experience with this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a lot of details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved with this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this with somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of the, I was the one watching
and taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing it together but they were
much more excited about it so I just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of observed and I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did it with the Ethafon 2SL.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sprayed multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them crinkled up, curled,
went to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them can take it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed it is ratio dependent,
also very strain dependent and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: look ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As hell, once they are transitioning to
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not attractive in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they finish up, they get kind of
weird, kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't spray one time with
Ethafon, I've learned that one spray of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethafon will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray too many times, they
definitely freak out later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is all I've got for you
with reversing males.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all the experience, all the info,
all the data that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't find it to be useful
because I can get more data in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: from just breeding that plant to females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get more feedback, more data and I get
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm just reversing it, I don't have
shit to show for my work except for some
[SPEAKER_00]: half ass data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a different solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the Ethafon 2SL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply it at a 1 to 100 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day we put the plants into flower,
that's all it needs and it should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments or concerns, you know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this conversation going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have reversed a male to show its
potential as a female, send me pictures,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me stories of your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about it more on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more questions like this,
I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the email address is

[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, everything is on my website,
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I talk a little bit fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people miss stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you could possibly imagine is
on the website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is going to be a quick
episode, short and sweet, nice and to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's all we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
friends at Lollipop Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
See you next time.
