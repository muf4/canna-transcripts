[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 139 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_04]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_04]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_04]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you once again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys sitting across the table from me
is our good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I listened to a podcast I recorded a
couple of days ago and you know what I say
[SPEAKER_04]: way too fucking much?
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My good friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I describe my level of friendliness with
somebody as good.
[SPEAKER_04]: My good buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means you've been elevated past just
my buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Promoted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little promotion that it's like a gold
star next to your name.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the fun things in the intro that I
always look for is the order in which the
[SPEAKER_03]: guests are introduced clockwise,
counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to do ladies first, but I smoke a
lot of dabs and sometimes I forget normal,
[SPEAKER_04]: what are those, casualties, pleasantries,
courtesies, common courtesies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget some of that shit sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just get high and I try.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to do, sometimes there's a method to
my madness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it just falls in place because
I'm high and that's how it went.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to quit saying good
buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: My good buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: You broke yourself with some of the
cussing so I bet you can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted it to be a listenable podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every now and then when I'm listening to a
show, I think I should stop doing that or
[SPEAKER_03]: I should slow down and then we get here
and start recording and all of that melts
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just do a hell of a show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody that I truly respect in the
podcasting industry listened to my podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: and he's like, I got to say I like your
show, but you sure do drop a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: f-bombs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh yeah, you're right,
sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a weed cast if you've got the kids
in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, if you're just curious about the
current state of cannabis, that could be
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be some people that are all at
church learning about cannabis through
[SPEAKER_04]: Rasta, Jeff and the Girl From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to turn down the music.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into the show now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I apologize for all of the show
intro rambling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need new glass, go to Elevate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy yourself a new rig, get a new dabber,
get a new carb cat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy yourself an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go say hi to the beautiful and lovely
ladies and one gentleman over at Elevate
[SPEAKER_04]: Glass in Colorado Springs, 517 South
Tejon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go park on Moreno.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the name of the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to park right there on
Tejon and spend money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go park on Moreno.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot more spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to park in front of the
restaurants and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Save yourself some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself some nice glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost not room for the microphones
tonight because Jeff's been shopping.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to clean this one is why this one's
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to put the e-nail on that one is
why that one is out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I like this banger on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This quartz nail on this Hitman rig is
pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoner dishes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like the action that I get off of
this Elevate Recycler.
[SPEAKER_04]: The action is just fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: It perks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It percolates.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a big fat rip off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, shout out to my friends at Elevate
Glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them a high five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them a hug.

[SPEAKER_04]: How you been, Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the most interesting thing you have
smoked since I've seen you last?
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the most interesting cannabis
product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just smoked, consumed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked a really crazy question that I
think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you smoke some DMT?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I really mean is what is the most
interesting cannabis product you've
[SPEAKER_04]: consumed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything get your attention cannabis wise
since last time I saw you?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some solventless ice wax floating
around that is pretty delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to sample a little of it tonight,
but I also got to sample of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody else got to show that off before
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my friend that got to show
that off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_04]: She should be here for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't invite her.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to do a little boy show
tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing against you, Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I just got to have Mike over,
do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'll have just Lindsay over,
we'll do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'll be here by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my podcast and I'll do what I want to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite aside in a while just
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before the ice wax, it was probably
the 60% CBD shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's labeled as shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's best to pull and snap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little hot lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody shatters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snap and peel right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's talking about some ice wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: What he's talking about is some cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is 120 micron ice wax made from fresh
frozen flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: This hashes, I say uh too much,
so I got to quit saying good buddy and uh.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something we got to fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a mental note.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to quit doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize if I've been doing that to you
too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but uh, this has been made with fresh
frozen material.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take the fresh frozen material and I
don't know the exact process, but when it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes back, it's delivered to us in a
cooler and we keep it in a cooler and it
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like beach sand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you just take a little of the beach
sand and throw it and like heat up the
[SPEAKER_04]: banger and throw out the banger,
you'll get a really good dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like to take some and fold it into
some parchment paper and I heat up my carb
[SPEAKER_04]: cap just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit it with the torch just for a second
and then roll it over it a couple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mash it into like a little patty and
make it look like a sheet of shatter or
[SPEAKER_04]: some pressed rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I take dabs of it like that and it
burns a little better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It burns a little more evenly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, man, it gets me really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, as you can tell from this intro,
we're both really baked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've smoked any BHO today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all of the smoking I've done has
been ice wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the lady said, your eyes are red as the
devil's dick son.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: What lady said that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the angry lady cop in, uh,
pineapple express.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I don't remember being there
for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like that didn't happen to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happened on film.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real listeners will get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's put this podcast of a train
wreck onto some, uh, rails.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of people that like it when we
ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, Seb?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, Seb?
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, uh, what up my friend down under.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for everything you do, Seb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, congratulations buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that is public knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you put it up on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats on the little one, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dudes in Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We learned about it on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can say congratulations on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, what are you going to name the kid?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what are some, oh man, don't put,
don't put that, start that pressure yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: People tweet us really cool cannabis
related baby names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweet them to me, uh, at GFY podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Add GFY podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know what you think are really
cool cannabis related baby names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary Jane is fucking obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say if you tweet Mary Jane
or Sativa or Indica, you're just out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruderalis would be a dick name right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause imagine Mary Jane in a little
Australian accent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why'd you have to go right there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Seb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll sound really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be offensive and try to
do a shitty Australian accent because I
[SPEAKER_04]: know it's not going to be good,
but it'll, it'll sound really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know, I know Seb's last name,
so it would really flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but you guys tweet me your ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's, but anyway, uh, shout out to our
friend, Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fred, uh, loved the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got the wrong email on the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fred loved the podcast that we put out
recently, uh, about breeding seeds and how
[SPEAKER_04]: to take care of his seed harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said there's something that we left
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just read what Fred sent me instead
of stumbling through this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, question about the last show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys mentioned moving seeded females
outside at some point in a run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wondering the right way to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run my lights at 6 PM to 6 AM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is the best transition time at 6
PM?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see at 6 PM when it usually light on
or, okay, or 6 AM when the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also here in SoCal, we have about 14 and a
half hours of light right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I do this, should I cut them off at
12 hours with some light depth or leave
[SPEAKER_04]: them be?
[SPEAKER_04]: All my outdoor plants are well into
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's got some, he's got a process on
his hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's got some seeded females.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got some plants that he, it sounds
like he's got some plants that were hit
[SPEAKER_04]: with pollen and they're seeded and he
wants to take them outside to finish up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's been running his lights from 6 PM
to 6 AM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically when the sun's going down,
his lights are coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and he wants to put these plants
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going, he's going to have to baby
step his way around the clock,
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't he?
[SPEAKER_04]: And introduce them into the sun's light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then slowly maybe also, I don't know
how big they are and how hardy they are,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't know if putting these plants
out into the sunshine, how you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: how slow you're slowly, you need to
introduce them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, shoot, you got a challenge there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would almost start adjusting your indoor
cycle to match the outdoor cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to, you can't jump it,
can you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do like six hours a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to do like half hour on either
end, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would almost, and this may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would almost leave the lights off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just unplug them and tell, and then reset
the schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, leave them off for a good 24 to 36
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: However you have to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just handle it like a power outage,
huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let it go for a long time because you
would rather interrupt a light period than
[SPEAKER_04]: a dark period.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clouds happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun at night doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just naturally those clouds don't
block out the sun for the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: receiving.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did, but it did not enough to put the
plant to sleep, but you don't want,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, you're not going to be able to get,
yeah, I think your best bet is just to
[SPEAKER_04]: start adjusting your timer to the outside
schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would leave it off for like 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just unplug it, leave it off for 24 to 36
hours so that those plants get that solid
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then whenever that next time,
like if you're, let's see, you're turning
[SPEAKER_04]: off at 6 AM.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what kind of stress is that going to do
the plants though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you've been around when the power's
gone out here for a while, or I've had,
[SPEAKER_04]: remember a long time ago, I had an issue
in a grow room and I couldn't get enough
[SPEAKER_04]: power and everything just fucked up and I
couldn't get the electrician here for
[SPEAKER_04]: several days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the old house.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was at the old house actually that we
couldn't get an electrician around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, they just stayed off for like 36
hours until the electrician could come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's better to put them in the
dark and just let them sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to get the sunshine or
the light for that day's growth,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're still going to keep
developing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got them seated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's got to hurry up and do this within
like a 24 to 36 hour period.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's only going to miss one day of that
photo period.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he'll make that, that photo period
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sun energy is definitely going to
make up for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll, that is a very good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plan so far is to kill the lights
for 24 to 36 hours, move the indoor girls
[SPEAKER_03]: onto a light cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in line with the outdoor light
cycle that he's currently dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he's going to run them in and in
and out every day, or is they just going
[SPEAKER_03]: to go outside full time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I just overcomplicate?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, you're right where you need to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flip the unplug them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let them rest in the dark until you
can get the timer to come back on when the
[SPEAKER_04]: sun comes up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so you're pretty much going to have
to, you're going to need 36 hours from
[SPEAKER_04]: your time schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like so unplug them,
wait until the sun, until you can match
[SPEAKER_04]: the time of the sun, let them get their
solid 12 hours of sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then match the time of the sun,
plug your timer into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe every day take them out for
four or five hours and pay really good
[SPEAKER_04]: attention to them and just take them out
and pay attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if you see them getting fucked up,
take them in the house and then do them
[SPEAKER_04]: for a little longer next time,
a little longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe if they're big and healthy
enough, it's Fred.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Fred, Fred, your plants are
healthy, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could probably take them out there and
put them out there and they'll be cool,
[SPEAKER_04]: but keep an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep a good eye on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be out there with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it acclimating and it really
does work best in stages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them two hours for two days and then
three hours for two days, that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then his next question, uh, next part of
his question, he says that out there in
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCal, they have about 14 and a half hours
of light right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if he does that, should he cut them off
at 12 hours with some light depth or let
[SPEAKER_04]: them be?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can cut them off with light depth,
that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, here's, uh, in Ed Rosenthal's
book, the Oaksterdam Course Guide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the exact title of the
book, but there is a section about near
[SPEAKER_04]: and far red lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, I'm, I would have to read it to
be completely accurate, but one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: spectrums happens when the sun sets and
rises.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens when the sun sets and that red,
it's either near or far red, tells the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That triggers it to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you're 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may be getting enough sleep time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure your plants are waking up and
going to bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, for there, I think you're going to
get, I think it's going to work out is
[SPEAKER_04]: what I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can cover it, do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if, if it's possible by all means,
just do it, make the extra effort and go
[SPEAKER_04]: for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're certain that it's going to
work out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can't build the outdoor hoop
house or whatever you're going to use to
[SPEAKER_04]: cover them light depth area, uh,
maybe wait just a couple of weeks and
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you'll be well into your outdoor
photo period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, Jesus, man, time flies when
you're having a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the club, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yesterday, my daughter turned 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting here thinking like,
nah, he just put the, people are just
[SPEAKER_03]: putting their plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, that happened weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants have been outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weeks and weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so my daughter turned 13 yesterday and
spent her birthday at a play in London.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, kiddo.
[SPEAKER_04]: She does not listen to the show,
but you know, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Fred, I hope we didn't give you just a
whole bunch of crap because we're both
[SPEAKER_04]: high and we rambled a lot, but hashtag
they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cut the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of answered his question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Fred's main problem that I foresee is
going to be, there's a reason he's running
[SPEAKER_03]: at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if he's lucky, it's just
economics.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go off at 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: So leave them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would normally come back on at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't turn them on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then leave them off until the sun comes
back up around six, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Figure out when the sun comes up that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're only going to be off for 24
hours because he's turning them off at 6 a
[SPEAKER_04]: .m.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying, Fred?
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to go at least 36.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was getting at is like people run
at night for, uh, for temperature reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot easier to cool your sister,
your room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At night and sometimes in some places
power's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people have day jobs and have to
grow wheat at night.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The electricity is cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, depending on what Fred's reasons
are for going at night, he, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, is definitely going to have some work
to, to figure out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some adjusting about a 36 hour window
there to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cut the timer, uh, get them on the same
schedule as the outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can, I, I, that's the best I could
tell you for that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, then start taking them outside slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or cut them off for 36 hours and then take
them outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you need to put them in the
hoop house to get them dark, do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, I think you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I could be wrong to be totally honest,
but I think, uh, about 13, 14 hours,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you should be getting enough nighttime
photo period for those plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: but be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many variables in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fred, I hope we answer your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we helped you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope, uh, I get a couple of packs of
those seeds when you get finished with
[SPEAKER_04]: this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, thanks for, uh, Fred, thanks for the
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been following me for a long time
on social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been listening to the show since,
I think you got a prize on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how long ago that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I'm thinking about it was a 50
when we gave away a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 50 or a hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, number 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had everybody here and we just got
crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Fred got a prize in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how long Fred's been supporting
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for interacting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you have a follow-up question to
our rambles, please send it to me the same
[SPEAKER_04]: way that you sent this one and I'll check
it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to move on to the next part of
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got an email from a friend who,
um, he has a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just read the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, Hey Rasta love the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can help me recover from a huge
mistake.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I may have mislabeled two
different plants when I was cloning them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I think five are Alaskan Thunderfuck
and five are master Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: How should I go about making sure I clone
and properly label said plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he says, should I take a clone of
each plant and label them mom and clone
[SPEAKER_04]: with a certain tag and do all 10 or should
I make more than one clone of each?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know after I clone, I need to toss the
moms into bloom after I see roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like this dude had a mother
plant and took clones, took 10 clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And may have mislabeled those 10 clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hoping he took five and five and lost
all 10 labels is basically what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: getting, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping he at least had the,
uh, the mother plants out properly and
[SPEAKER_04]: took five and five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that that went right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, that's, I didn't even think
about that part when I read the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real, the real answer to this is,
is proper labeling from the get-go and how
[SPEAKER_03]: each grower goes about that is wildly
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll give him my advice and,
uh, props for admitting that you may have
[SPEAKER_04]: made a mistake, but in your pothead mind,
you probably did it just fine in your
[SPEAKER_04]: paranoid, but let's, uh, he asks,
first of all, now I think five or this and
[SPEAKER_04]: five or this, how should I go about making
sure I clone and properly label said
[SPEAKER_04]: plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take all 10 of those plants and set them
in a straight line of a row and then grab
[SPEAKER_04]: one plant, the one that's in the front of
the row and take that to an area and get
[SPEAKER_04]: some white duct tape and write a on that
one and then cut as many clones as you can
[SPEAKER_04]: cut from it without killing that plant and
label all of those clones very clearly.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you, if you cut them into a rapid
routers, if you cut them into an easy
[SPEAKER_04]: cloner, label them a, and then take that
plant that's labeled a and put it
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now go get the next plant that's in that
straight line filled with plants and carry
[SPEAKER_04]: it over to the cloning area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that white duct tape, write a B on
there and label that motherfucker B and
[SPEAKER_04]: then take as many clones as you can get
off of a plant that is now a number B,
[SPEAKER_04]: get as many clones as you can and label
them carefully B.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my friend, I think that's what's
got to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, uh, it's all in setting it up from
the get go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to help a dude clone a hundred,
200 clones at a time from six,
[SPEAKER_03]: eight, 10 different strains and,
um, everything got labeled when they're in
[SPEAKER_03]: that obnoxious little pup 10 cloner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we'd cut little slivers out of a solo
cup, um, and use those as little label
[SPEAKER_03]: pegs.
[SPEAKER_03]: To go in next to the plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people use really good little
labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those little just plant label sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just use those and write on those and
stick them in the neoprene is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen ones that look like,
uh, it almost looks like a little flag
[SPEAKER_03]: that you would stick in like a sandwich or
something like a toothpick that stick
[SPEAKER_03]: right in the plugs that make it real easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but like keeping your labels good from
the get goes the best way here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as long as you make sure you've got,
um, uh, a healthy clone from your mother,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you flower that out, like you'll be
able to tell, Oh, this one's more cushy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully within like four or five to six
weeks, you'll know which is, and as long
[SPEAKER_03]: as you go ahead and get your labels right,
when you clone next, um, you'll know for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, these clones are definitely from plant
a, these clones are definitely from plant
[SPEAKER_03]: B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you fucking fit or once you finally
finish it out, you'll know, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, plant a, it was the Alaskan plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you're going to take cuts,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to have hopefully three,
how do you take three cuts?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got OCD that works in groups of
threes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take, uh, take three cuts and then
take mother plant a mother plant B,
[SPEAKER_04]: line them back up in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: All pretty, let your clones root.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as you see roots on there,
uh, put them into their next stage,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is usually a cup for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people use a little one gallon pot,
whatever you want to do, put it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: next step and then take that one that you
cut the clone from it's already grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, just go flower that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what the plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Called for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think he just wants to make sure he
gets his genetics, uh, toss the moms into
[SPEAKER_04]: bloom after I see roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you figured out what you got to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to take clones from every one of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the best part is now you're going
to have a bunch of clones to grow next
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if you're, if, if you're not sure at
this point, what you're, what you're about
[SPEAKER_03]: to flower out is, and you're not a hundred
percent sure you've got its genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, preserved in a healthy clone,
just go ahead and take another clone and
[SPEAKER_03]: then give it, I mean, you only have to
give it a few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you only take three clones,
four clones off of it, unless your mother
[SPEAKER_03]: plant is really like, I don't know if he's
still got a mother plant, like the
[SPEAKER_04]: original mom that these five of each
clones came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where that is in this story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just assuming he doesn't have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming all he's got are these 10
clones and he's got to figure out what
[SPEAKER_03]: could easily be that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, hopefully there's five and
five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched you clone a nugget.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were handed once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell people all the crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you've still got the plant alive,
you can, you can preserve the genetics if
[SPEAKER_03]: you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were at a garden and somebody was
trying to be nice and blessed me by
[SPEAKER_04]: cutting off a fresh little tiny bottom
bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, try that out and check
it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I wasn't going to see the guy for a
while and I wasn't going to get a chance
[SPEAKER_04]: to taste the medicine when it finished.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gave me, it still had leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fresh off the bud and we're driving
and Mike said, you know what you should do
[SPEAKER_04]: is you should try to clone that because it
was a plant that we really wished we had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cloned it and it took a long time to
revert that bud back into a usable plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was able to clone that plant and we
had that strain around for, it was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: a mutant of it, but it was very similar to
the flavor, but it still looked the same,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so I did clone a flowered bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a long time to revert it and the
leaves did a bunch of spirally weird
[SPEAKER_04]: twisty shit, but yeah, I've done some
crazy things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So dude, what you got to do, I'm going to
recap and then we're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take clones from all of them as many
clones as you can afford to take space
[SPEAKER_04]: wise and without murdering that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then while you're taking those clones,
carefully shape that plant to something
[SPEAKER_04]: that would flower nicely, then carry those
to the flower room when you see roots and
[SPEAKER_04]: flower the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's my advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, dude, thank you for the
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I helped you out next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Label more carefully, but don't be afraid
to admit that you make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please continue to send me emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep me updated on this, how this goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you hit me up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like thanks for following me on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, if you want to follow me on
Instagram, it's irey score genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now today, something cool happened in the
state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something very cool happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something very cool happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't live here, if you don't want,
yeah, if you live here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wrote, I wrote down a list of pros
and I want to see if there's a list of
[SPEAKER_04]: cons that you can come up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we talk about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so today the Colorado MED stated that
does it start today?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told it started today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then by the time this recording
comes out, it will have already started.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't change this rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: This rule was changed in the legislature,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if I'm not mistaken, the, the
legislatures wrote it, passed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was signed by the governor and the MED
implemented it today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I didn't even think this was going to
pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really, really, really nice,
uh, nice little gift to the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just built up so much suspense that
we should tell everybody what happened.
Guess what happened?
Guess what happened?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's starting today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today is, uh, July, June 16th while we
travel.
[SPEAKER_04]: June 16th, 15th, June 15th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank Christ.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 16th.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's the, well, it's after midnight is
why I'm tripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was going to say, I've got an
anniversary like Maniana just about fucked
[SPEAKER_03]: that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy anniversary, Jen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, she probably isn't, uh, so she's
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened on the 15th.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now recording after midnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Midnight is passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it started on the 15th.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're rambling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as of today, as of today, out of state
shoppers in a dispensary before today,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's rewind before today, out of state
shoppers were limited to seven grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: raw cannabis on their purchase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now those same shoppers, folks who are
over 21 and have an ID that can prove.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they're from out of state,
they are able to purchase one ounce of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis product per visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like someone that lives here,
you can walk in and buy one ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that native sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're equals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're all equals.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come here and buy just the same
amount of marijuana as anybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're allowed to possess it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only problem is there's still nowhere
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was another rule that was,
uh, it was passed last, last November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was supposed to go in effect in
January and they kicked it down the road
[SPEAKER_03]: till October that was going to restrict,
um, out of state folks, uh, edible wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to crank down those
limits quite a bit, but I think all that
[SPEAKER_03]: just went out the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it when they toss shit out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what did pass was no more gummy
bears, no more gummy bears, no more
[SPEAKER_04]: edibles, no more cannabis infused edibles
shaped like gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a no more edibles shaped like fruit
shapes, animals, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically anything that like is currently
on the market other than squares and
[SPEAKER_03]: triangles.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't want the kids to be
encouraged by a great shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the same day that particular,
the edible restriction bill was signed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The governor signed another bill to put
hard liquor in grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that on the same day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you can buy whiskey and tequila at
Walmart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be gradual.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the next couple of years,
it'll just be wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you mean I'll be able to buy a gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be able to buy a gun and a bottle of
whiskey at the right super store at the
[SPEAKER_04]: right Walmart, probably the one that did
Pablo West.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the, at the, at the right Walmart,
you will be able to get a gun and hard
[SPEAKER_03]: liquor and frozen pizza and the new Xbox
America all at once while your oil is
[SPEAKER_03]: getting changed and you're getting your
glasses and doing your banking and taking
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures of sweet mullets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you're searching for mullets
while you're at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can find somebody, all right guys,
challenge, challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want some, I want a picture of somebody
in their pajamas with a mullet at a
[SPEAKER_04]: Walmart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I want it to be your photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fucking internet me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't Google this shit prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, an extra small, slightly dirty Irish
shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't have any shirts I can offer
because they're all at the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really sweaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'll send you some stickers,
some stickers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got stickers all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't guarantee what they'll be,
but they'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking stickers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you, I'll stuff an envelope with
what I think will, they'll look at me
[SPEAKER_04]: like, bro, you need to pay extra shipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I send these stickers, I'll stuff an
envelope.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's, here's the task.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pajamas, mullet at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to send it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you can just tweet it to me,
uh, at GFYH podcast, tweet it to me and
[SPEAKER_04]: then hashtag it mullet challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If Fred wins this one too, I'm going to be
a little ashamed of some of the other
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have Walmart in Australia?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is web get, or is I'm going to have to
drive like 600 miles to take this
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in another country, if you're
in, if they're, you're in a place that
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't have a, we will email you pictures
of stickers.
Seb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seb, I can't mail you stickers,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in Australia and that's going to be
so expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked and I researched how much it
would cost to send them a shirt and the
[SPEAKER_04]: shipping was just more than what the
shirts are even worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, no, dude, no, I'm not going to
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, uh, I looked up what it takes to
send stuff to Costa Rica recently and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was like, that ain't getting pictures of
the kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least you can man.
[SPEAKER_04]: United States citizens only in the
continental United States are qualified
[SPEAKER_04]: for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, but I tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I can't be shipping shit across
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad we were able to disappoint you
now and not after you drove six hours to
[SPEAKER_03]: the Walmart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, mullet challenge you guys,
uh, mullet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see some good mullets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pajamas, Walmart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could probably drive seven minutes and
find that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet that's happening right up the
street, right up the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to put this podcast back on
some rails?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been all over the place since we
started.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's even happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you too listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'm mean, but you know,
I love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not that mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just, man, he's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'm mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now if you're coming from out of state,
you can now purchase an ounce of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy an ounce people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No more plastic chairs, little plastic
table at dinner for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you don't have to drive to four
different dispensaries to have an ounce of
[SPEAKER_03]: weed or run to your car four times.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was getting so old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do when we made them drive around the
store, it legitimately caused traffic
[SPEAKER_03]: issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think, uh, do you think people are
going to try to do that and buy more
[SPEAKER_04]: ounces?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think the, you said you wanted a
list of the benefits and the cons and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's the con.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think the dipshit from two states
over that comes here, drops his monthly
[SPEAKER_03]: paycheck, drives all that home and flips
it a couple of times a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's going to get a little,
or at least has the potential to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: little worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more of those idiots that get
caught, the worse we look, the more heat
[SPEAKER_03]: on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need any more black eyes right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said black eyes, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Black eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis industry is under a lot of
fire right now, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can't keep our best foot
forward, we're going to be a past tense
[SPEAKER_03]: here in three or four years instead of
bigger and better than ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, quit shipping stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't ship you anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen, saw three or four posts this
week on social media of people saying just
[SPEAKER_03]: straight up, stop fucking asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we're not going to mail you
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to send you anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm not going to sleep with you for
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just the most obnoxious shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just knock it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like none of that exists here anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got rid of all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to the store and you point at the
jar you like and you buy as much as you
[SPEAKER_04]: can afford and then you go home and puff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: But every time another package gets caught
in the mail or another putz from another
[SPEAKER_03]: state gets caught with 300 plants in his
backyard going, but I thought weed was
[SPEAKER_03]: legal here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the whole industry takes a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if we take enough of those,
we're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really like my job people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can, you get that
inflection over the radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even with all the crap I had,
I have to deal with because of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't want to go do trouble again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like being able to grow cannabis
on a large scale without having to watch
[SPEAKER_04]: over my shoulder all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done working with jail broken
teenagers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I work in the cannabis industry now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, if you fuck this up,
I will be famous for being an ax murder,
[SPEAKER_03]: chasing down all the idiots who ruined it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, those statements are only supported by
a white Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the opinions of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so obnoxious watching people
fuck this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some of the pros then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pros, this is huge for out of
staters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy an ounce just like a big boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for shops it, I mean it makes life so
much easier for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can stop counting to seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like half my day as a bud tender,
like one, two, three, four, five,
[SPEAKER_03]: six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gonna have to do trend two transactions,
sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to run out your car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's the rule deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have ludicrous metaphors to just
shut people up immediately with,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, this is ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you guys just shut up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to have that conversation at
ninth time today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got sentences to just shut it
down, but we get, we get rid of all of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I hope they leave the edibles and the
concentrates purchase limits alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that those don't get, end up still
getting cranked down in November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it makes stuff so much easier on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the only industry on the planet
where you can't buy what you can pay for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you think about what purchase limits
does actually mean and where they apply
[SPEAKER_03]: elsewhere in the world, it's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I think something that's helpful
is now you can try more variety before
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd go and you'd get an eighth of that
and an eighth of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's what you got to smoke on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can get a real variety without
destroying the price on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get seven grams instead of two
eighths or a quarter, you pay a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you miss out on all the price breaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so picking up four eighths is a lot
better economically than picking up seven
[SPEAKER_03]: grams split four ways per gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like by miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get more herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the advantages and more
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fewer trips.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go to and from the dispensary
less times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go stand in line.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to, don't have to deal with that
dickhead security guard as many times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to pull out your ID and
your card and sit there and wait and then
[SPEAKER_04]: go hit the ATM and pull out money as many
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then go see some person that doesn't
really want to deal with you asking
[SPEAKER_04]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, no, your bartenders happy with
questions or if they're not find a better
[SPEAKER_03]: shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tip them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, if you're watching this good tip
your bun tender, they worked really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave you a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course, if your legal limit is
an ounce, why can't we buy an ounce?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, duh, that seems weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make me go to four places to get my
legal limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you just trying to make me shop at
four different places?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think places are going to lose
business because, uh, the guys that are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to buy the guys there, there are
obviously people that come from out of
[SPEAKER_04]: town or out of state to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come and they just buy stuff to go to
the second shop that wasn't like shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: A gets hit first, like their favorite
shop, the shop that has exactly the best
[SPEAKER_03]: price of the best selection, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now does shop B lose three quarters?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shop B loses at least a second visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or does he go to shop B and buy a whole
nother ounce?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause now it's that much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really, I think the people that were
doing that anyway, cause a lot of shops
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed you to make four visits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just made four visits at A,
made four visits at B or went to A,
[SPEAKER_03]: went to B, went to A, went to B,
went to A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we would have people bitch about like
how far apart we were from the others,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, from time to time in the butt room.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Making the drive one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting, getting a little dizzy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, dude, quit being a douche.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so we've got a little list of
pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really happy this rule passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes my life simpler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it has the potential to increase
business a little bit, but not,
[SPEAKER_03]: not dramatically.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the people, to the better dispensaries
that like we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe that second and third tier
dispensary, you're going to lose that
[SPEAKER_04]: second quarter that would have gotten the
sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the guy had money for a half,
he's probably just going to buy that whole
[SPEAKER_04]: half ounce at the good shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if he was going to buy an ounce,
he's going to buy it all there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the other little downside is,
everyone that moved here for marijuana had
[SPEAKER_03]: a big incentive to go get their ID
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when they went to the DMV and got
their ID changed, they got registered to
[SPEAKER_03]: vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make that very easy here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's going to slow down just a
little bit, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's just another little,
a negative in the negative column piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of negatives to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think of how that went as long as
Texans don't torpedo it for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm, I'm really happy about this,
but yeah, I've, uh, pretty much everyone I
[SPEAKER_03]: talked to that moved here for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yep, get my ID switched.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a vote for you in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's pretty helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even think of that because I've
been a resident for so long that I never
[SPEAKER_04]: thought about how to switch my ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're not dealing with the crowd at
the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the people I talked to were,
are inquiring about how to go medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you work for a medical dispensary in
the grow even.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not even handling patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go there occasionally, I drop off
product and I go purchase my own products,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I spend very little time there,
but I see, yeah, I see patients come and
[SPEAKER_04]: go and yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the first wave when they get here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they just enacted a new rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts either the first, it starts on
the 1st of July.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if you are trying to use your
extended plant count at a medical
[SPEAKER_04]: facility, you have to be a member of that
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is that an official rule?
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that was the policy that a lot of
shops had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've made an official rule is what I
think I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the door at one of the stores and
they're really looking to crack down on
[SPEAKER_03]: some, some of the, um, abuses that can
take place in the medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going overboard in my opinion,
but like they've had it, they've caught
[SPEAKER_03]: enough really shady shit that like,
I'm not surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regulators are pissed and cracking
down Colorado people with the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: card.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if that shit's getting close to
expiring, go renew it because it's taking
[SPEAKER_04]: a long time for my renewal to come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's what sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have your actual card,
if your old card, you can only go get your
[SPEAKER_04]: new card 30 days before your old card
expires.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't renew within 30 days of the old
one expiring, but it takes about 45 days
[SPEAKER_04]: for your new card to come in the mail and
you're not allowed to shop in a dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: until you have that new permanent card in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be about it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a couple of week gap before I've
been able to shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on how you plan for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be a nasty gap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see those people too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a regular doctor that I go to for
my MMJ recommendation and I've got a
[SPEAKER_04]: schedule and appointment and he's been so
busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took me several days to get in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't get in as quickly as I wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that put me two more weeks behind and
then yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that puts me six weeks out and then
it's taking about eight weeks I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I need a card.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily I'm stocked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is never bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life's always good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life's what you make of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're having a shitty time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a fad dab and fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice fad dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll fix just about any day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, we've been going for about 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We covered some good points.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did some educating.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had cannabis education and we certainly
had cannabis conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we fucking nailed it on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really did.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's three for three people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some round of applause for your choice
hosts.
[SPEAKER_03]: High five across the table, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We nailed that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We literally did high five you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I barely heard that through my headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really high five.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a compressor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a compressor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some compression on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really, really, really nice gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't sound this butter sweet in
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had people recognize me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the Mystic Root Show the other
day and somebody goes, you look familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, I work at the Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, I do a podcast about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she goes, Oh my God, that voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I said it like, I do a podcast all
about cannabis, just being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, I recognize your voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you still listen, shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you do, but shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Mike, thanks for joining me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do my friends that are listening
follow you on social media?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find me at Nemopunk15 on Twitter
and you can find me at Pueblo for Sensible
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Support that.

stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Support what we, they are trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put my self in that, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Support what Mike is trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike is probably the leading cannabis
activist that I am aware of in this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen you team up with a few other
cool people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to you guys for doing all
that for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting a nice little team put
together for this response effort to the
[SPEAKER_03]: group trying to ban us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a really fun year for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might sleep through all the 2017 at this
pace though, cause I'm kind of running
[SPEAKER_03]: myself ragged.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you've got a little kid, so don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really might.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might just throw down every penny I make
this year to pay somebody else to keep him
[SPEAKER_03]: alive until I wake up from my coma.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have a child, sometimes when
you're sleeping, you're dreaming about
[SPEAKER_04]: sleeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like a dick all the times I said I
was tired before the last 10 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost want to go back and apologize to
the people with kids that I was talking to
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was like, man, I'm too tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be at work today.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just gave me the look that I give
people in their twenties now and they say
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're savages at Argrove.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand how you're feeling about
being tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing 40 a week at work and another 20
a week on the campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I've got a 10 month old that I play
with for at least 30 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sleep for three, five, eight hours a
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say some of those play
hours are random.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you expect it to be asleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two in the morning, we're up playing on
the floor and he's in his bounce chair
[SPEAKER_03]: just going off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, dude, it's quarter to three.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to be like us when he gets
older.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, Mike and I are both night
owls.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was great when we both
discovered that we both like to be fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: doing whatever happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to build crows and people were
like, when can you come do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we show up at midnight?
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd think we're fucking crazy,
but we'd just crush a grow out while
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else was gone and build it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd show up in the morning and be like,
wow, a grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the night we trim somebody's crop for
them until the sun came up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They woke up and had several pounds
trimmed that weren't trimmed the night
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_04]: His wife made me leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go home, get some rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Toke Radio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my friend Jessica.

outs.

[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, shout out to your recent guests.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the last episode with the barefoot
blower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that was going to stick so
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll stick, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've really liked the last couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob from Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget Rob from Sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob knows a lot about breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I tried to bring him on for the
breeding podcast.
That was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always love it when other people are on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me really wish that I was here to
record that and that it makes me want to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a better guest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So great job, yo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hear that, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike is trying to be a better guest.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You notice how I didn't incite anyone to
violence this show?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you said something about becoming
an ax murderer at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was my personal, that's just
where I see my life going.
[SPEAKER_03]: If idiots screw up legalization,
that's just a likely possible future.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what you could do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You could go to iTunes.

[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus our discussion first on
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very distinct smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pass around just a little
tiny bit, and I want you all to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: smell so you know when someone is smoking
marijuana near you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The urban medication is for
[SPEAKER_02]: the healthy nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said you know my
feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me such inspiration to look and think
another way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You help me relax at the end of my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you feel like I feel, let me hear
you say, pass the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give job thanks and breaks today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass the marijuana any old kind of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give job thanks and breaks today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass the marijuana any old kind of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it real nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: but boom, about two feet long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't have to hit it twice, and you still
feel nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said you know my feeling.
