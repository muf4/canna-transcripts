[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 272 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: For letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, excuse the coffee,
crunchy, shitty sound and voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a little bit of a cold for the
past week and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming through on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of people mentioned they could
hear it in last week's episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for sounding like shit,
you guys, but the show must go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a professional podcaster, I will put
out a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me this evening to make sure this
show doesn't sound completely terrible is
[SPEAKER_02]: White Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for covering for me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I cough a little bit over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, this episode is coming out on
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're doing Christmas, Merry
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening Christmas after
Christmas, I hope you had a good
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't going to be a super intensive
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably won't need a notebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to want to take a whole
lot of notes on this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many people are going to
listen to a Christmas episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one may just get lost in the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I are going to hang out,
take some dabs and talk about a few
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may lose one or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a little Christmas
vacation also while we're on the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: here and hang out, take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to start off the show most of the
time by sharing what we've been dabbing
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started dabbing this episode on Pura
Vida high cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: extract with a little bit of clementine
batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't get the Pura Vida to stick to
the dabber, so I just put enough of the
[SPEAKER_02]: clementine batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a good base, a nice mortar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's stuck on there real well,
and I just stick those little crystals
[SPEAKER_02]: into there, and then it gives me a nice
little dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I had some of the clementine
left over because it was Miss JB's
[SPEAKER_02]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy late birthday, Miss JB, if you
listen to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a little birthday party at the
Studio 64, and I got her some clementine
[SPEAKER_02]: to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: She took a big old fat dab of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: She took a giant dab of some, I don't
remember the strain, but she had a giant
[SPEAKER_02]: crystal, a giant HCFSE crystal.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had to be at least half a gram,
and she took the whole dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: She didn't choke very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got high as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: She melted into the couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm talking about JB's birthday,
happy birthday, and also, big shout out to
[SPEAKER_02]: all the bearded men and their wives that
joined us for the birthday party.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked around at the party, and every
dude there had a killer beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that came to the party,
that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn down that music.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making my brain go too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's been a long week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been a long couple of weeks,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been a long year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're wrapping up the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: This may be the last, is this the last
podcast of the year that the people will
[SPEAKER_02]: hear?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one will be in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: The future.
[SPEAKER_02]: The future.
The future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's been a long week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking Monday, I didn't even go to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt so shitty Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Monday at work, everybody was sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a skeleton crew for the first half
of the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, take your vitamins, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the skeleton crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working with a big group of
people, take your vitamins, because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: winter time and everyone's getting sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's three different nasty colds going
around our area, and it's not fun to be
[SPEAKER_03]: alive right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've got to just dodge a lot of
germage in Pueblo right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to drink a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to take some vitamins.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to take the emergency or
whatever you choose to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: My poor hands, the other night I straight
looked like skeletons or all my skin was
[SPEAKER_03]: all dry and wrinkly and cracky from the
freaking weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your nose as well.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody's got a runny nose around
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of yourselves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a cold place, take care of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat them vitamins, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tuesday I went to work, but then all
the work crew was like, you look like a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking zombie go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came and slept all the Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Wednesday I went to work and was
half-assed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday I was mostly there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, today was management day where
all the management comes and you do that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was- Meetings like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there wasn't much physical shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of chilled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just got to walk around and talk and
fucking do all that management shit today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strategize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of strategically that did happen
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of shit got managed today.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things did get managed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to our buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't want to be named, I'm pretty
sure, but the guy that comes and helps us.
Hi buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to that dude for coming and
helping us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_02]: We covered JB's birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday again, Miss JB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to all the people that
joined me for the birthday party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to our friend Bacon that drove
down from Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacon does not consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came to a cannabis social club to
hang out with a bunch of potheads on Miss
[SPEAKER_02]: JB's birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about it on Instagram Live this
week, perhaps later this evening,
[SPEAKER_02]: is pollen time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure they're ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at them last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three days ago, you were like,
they're probably ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should wait a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm way impressed you've made it to
Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much easier for me to clean up on
a Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have as much time constraint
before I go to another garden that I could
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy.
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who works in the same
commercial facility as you do,
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you waiting.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight may be the night that the pollen
gets chucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got two clones of the same male.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dropping pollen really heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about the Durban poison and
Stardog, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to that Durban cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be really neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any idea of what it's going
to be called.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have ideas of what I think it's going to
smell like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what some of the phenotypes I'm
hoping for are going to smell like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping to bring back some of that old
land race Durban with some of those giant
[SPEAKER_02]: colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want shit that takes like 14
weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping I've got some like 10 week
donkey dick, anise, licorice, scented
[SPEAKER_02]: trichome laden funk going on out of that
cross is my goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: With any luck?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of things I already know
I'm really looking forward to about next
[SPEAKER_03]: year and that's on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Stardog in there and Stardog is a
great commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: She grows big fat dense colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: She smells really well, but there's
something missing from the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think putting that Arise resin on it
will fix that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to trying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a fun next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something that smells really
amazing in that room, the smell is
[SPEAKER_02]: overwhelming the room right now is the
platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a funk that'll fill up the whole
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells so good in that room just
because of the platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cactus cooler in there also,
which usually stinks up the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now it's the platinum tangy
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tangy is just, I mean, just that citrus
kind of, it's almost like a citrus
[SPEAKER_03]: antibody odor funk just for days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking about that is why I paused.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a citrus and body odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've called it one of the extra,
when you smoke tangy dabs or even
[SPEAKER_02]: Clementine dabs too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it tastes like orange chicken or
garlic chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it smells like to me,
like garlic, like tofu, garlic,
[SPEAKER_02]: orange tofu, but it would be orange
chicken from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had chicken in fucking years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it smells like orange chicken or
garlic chicken to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remember orange chicken from 1997.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, circa, circa 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so pollen this week,
which means in the future there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: new crosses for people to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there will be replenishings of
things that are unavailable currently at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Hela Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, also a big shout out to my
friends at the Hela Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have mentioned them at the top of
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that kind of show folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we're talking about seeds,
we'll talk about the Hela Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking to add something new to
your garden, I would recommend visiting
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The traditional New Year's gift is seeds,
if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure that's the new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: dankseed.store for all your irie genetics
needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They carry other brands there as well,
but check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else should we hit on before we start
a RambleFest here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, pretty sure RambleFest is already in
at least third gear, but I'm just getting
[SPEAKER_02]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you owe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashtag they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something we did not mention yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a shout out to some friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up friends?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, shout out to all of our
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever met, seen, heard of,
read about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only shouting out to people that have
gotten a high five or better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to extend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a butterfly landed on me and then
landed on you, if you rode on the same
[SPEAKER_02]: subway car as me, if you've been in the
same taxi as me, whatever, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This got weird quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what I was going to say though?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is another podcast all about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people say, Rasta Jeff,
you've got the best cannabis show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it that it's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's no competition when it
comes to cannabis podcasts because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: all, as long as we're not coming on and
being like, I shot up 17 marijuana's and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing the devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to rape white bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you come on and you talk about
cannabis in a positive way, we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to support all the cannabis
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason the word favorite exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of cannabis podcasts
that honestly bore the living fuck out of
[SPEAKER_02]: me and I can't listen to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today in cannabis, and I'm like,
oh, fucking shut up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still friends with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're like, hey, we're going to get
shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't give me $2, I'd fucking give
them $2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I support all the cannabis podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that some people feel I am the
best, that I am their favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to listen to another podcast
frequently, and the reason that I don't is
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't want to contaminate
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to recite somebody else's
podcast voice or style or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do it on accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: I catch myself turning into Joe Rogan
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go on a rant, I'm Dennis Miller and
Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis Miller from the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get some- A lot of people our age
rant like Dennis Miller's No Cure for
[SPEAKER_03]: Cancer album.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't help it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to watch the show that he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we learned it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even remember the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had an HBO show and it was fucking
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was when I was kind of new at smoking
pot at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still lived with my mom at the time and
my parents and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was young, but I would smoke pot at home
and she knew, but she wouldn't say shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Dennis Miller's comedy show,
I wish I could think of the name of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Dennis Miller's comedy show came on
on HBO, it was just like- 99% sure it was
[SPEAKER_03]: No Cure for Cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the one that starts the asshole
show?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't a stand-up show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a reoccurring?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was like a sketch show weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time that would come on,
I remember I would pack up the bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would fucking sit at the edge of the bed
and hit the bong and get all stoned and
[SPEAKER_02]: laugh my ass off to that Dennis Miller
fucking show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I catch myself doing Rogan and Dennis
Miller and a lot of times, Joey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I catch myself doing Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear the Joey sometimes when you're
going on a rest, especially on a good solo
[SPEAKER_03]: show when you're fairly baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll hear Joey pop out occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes less than intentionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard so much Joe Rogan and Joey Diaz
that said, I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to turn into Danny Danko or
Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even more specifically, Scotty Real and
The Dude because that's who I'm talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scotty Real and The Dude host a show
called The Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave us a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a shout out technically,
but they kind of shared it with White
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every episode, The Dude Grow Show does a
segment called The Executive Producer and
[SPEAKER_02]: they pick somebody who has inspired them
or done something that they feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically how I give everyone a shout
out at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say, executive producer this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few days ago, they said Rasta Jeff and
they gave me a nice shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they mentioned that I do the show by
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do probably 70% of these podcasts by
myself, but then they mentioned White Mike
[SPEAKER_02]: comes and joins them and he has a lot of
cool people on there with him also.
[SPEAKER_02]: They specifically said White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I even say this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm my least favorite guest that you have
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the shows where everybody else is
on way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already know what you're going to say
and you don't find you interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I find me interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the same about you Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 35-40% of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look forward to when certain guests I
know are going to be on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know when they're coming over to record
and then when I know they've recorded,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the fuck is in your note?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends that have been on my show,
I want you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels awkward asking my friends do you
have time to come be on my show because
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's fucking busy, especially with
the holidays, especially since most of you
[SPEAKER_02]: are growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: This last year has been insane for
everybody.
Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us like myself run a commercial
grow and then do consulting for somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: else's grow and then try to have our own
small private grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we also have lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach drum lessons right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lives, other gigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't have done this tomorrow
because I'm going to be Christmas
[SPEAKER_03]: shopping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about the giant cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did not mean to throw out a giant cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a cold going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sniffling a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're super busy getting over here even
for me to do a 45-minute show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just slip over here after work and hang
around a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go drive right to my house so that
we can record a podcast right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dumb luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife is out with Denise and the kids so
I had 45 minutes where I could squeeze
[SPEAKER_03]: away free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise I'd be cooking right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel a little bit anxious because
normally I have responsibilities for this
[SPEAKER_03]: segment of time during the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, who's got this going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who took care of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I want to get more of my
friends on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird asking people,
hey, come be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know Jeff and have good stuff to
contribute, by all means, send him a text
[SPEAKER_03]: and say you want to get on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Message me somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are all invited back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come be on the show, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I see you, I'll hit you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, The Dude Grows gave us a huge
shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, The Dude Grows, if I were listening
to a cannabis podcast, that's the one I
[SPEAKER_02]: would hit play.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at my playlist, it's the split
podcast with Bo who's taking a little
[SPEAKER_02]: break.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's on a hiatus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Bo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next podcast in line is our
friends at The Dude Grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those are in my favorites list.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dude Grows Cup is coming up in April.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the date of it, but I don't
remember it off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it in a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: So The Dude Grows Cup is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: If things line up for me, I will go to
that event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to make sure there's nothing else
more pressing at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to figure out priorities and work
and all that shit, but I should be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: make that.
[SPEAKER_03]: April tends to be a pretty busy month for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it will be huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of celebrating that the
community does during then, but when you
[SPEAKER_03]: work in the industry, that's your
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dude or Scotty, when you guys message
me, let me know about The Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know about Boots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know about Vending.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I Vend a Seeds at The Dude Grows Cup?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I set up a booth and Vend a Seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have a lot to do with my
attendance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, I'm going to do my best to be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to press pause and I'm
going to pull up a message from Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just talk for a second?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk for a couple seconds about some shit
while I find a screenshot of a message
[SPEAKER_02]: that I sent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're putting me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope you all had a good Christmas,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find that cool cousin, go for a good walk
before dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Introduce him to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do smoke with somebody that's
new, go gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't scare them away from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them the spiel about how you eat one
edible and wait two hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't eat the whole candy bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them a nice, gentle intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe if it's like, you know,
your cousin who thinks he's cool and
[SPEAKER_02]: thinks he's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's like Darren a teenager.
[SPEAKER_03]: To drink all the 151 like they're going to
try and then you're going to feel like an
[SPEAKER_03]: asshole for doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just go easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you probably will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really depends whose car they throw up in,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me a shitty flashback.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I just gave everyone a shitty
flashback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's why it's not cool to do that
with edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was driving and then I heard this
gurgling noise and I looked in my rear
[SPEAKER_02]: view mirror and I wish I hadn't looked in
the mirror because I just watched vomit
[SPEAKER_02]: fly out of both nose holes and the mouth
all into the back seat of my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, that's why you don't
give drunk people a ride home.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did find the message here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not the correct message.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lied.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is screenshot and it's just not a
screenshot of the correct message here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says question for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to kind of edit it
because I don't know where the original
[SPEAKER_02]: message came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody took a screenshot of this and
then sent this to me and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says question for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I like to say I already know what
I'm going to do in regards to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I'm curious to see if there is
one sentiment over the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it says scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grower gets seeds from a breeder and
or a seed bank finds a rare cut or a
[SPEAKER_02]: select Fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would getting a cut back to the breeder be
the right thing to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: To be clear, nobody has asked for it or
has suggested doing so.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cut isn't necessarily for breeding,
but more as a gesture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you just keep it and sit on it
for your own enjoyment?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this guy also kind of asked me,
how do you feel about people breeding with
[SPEAKER_02]: your seeds once you sell them seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first part is to be more clear
about the question, if somebody were to go
[SPEAKER_02]: obtain, I read genetic seeds, however you
get them, if you get them from me,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you get them from the Hella dank seed
bank, if they fell out of the sky,
[SPEAKER_02]: however you ended up with them,
if you were to grow them and you were to
[SPEAKER_02]: find something stellar, are you supposed
to get me a clone of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect shit, but it would be cool
if you live near me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're around, I think if you expect
it, you're a douchebag.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you offer it like it's definitely
not expected, but it's cool and sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: it's probably not wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be cool if you got one like our
friends at Organtica having a rise that
[SPEAKER_02]: tested at 35%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, bring me a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love a clone of that, but if I don't
get one, that's fine with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same level, if I told you I had
a fire or a rise, you know, and did you
[SPEAKER_03]: want a cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd probably say no.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd probably come over and check it out
before you let that go any further.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go look at yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go take pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of all the people that used
to bring those half-dead clones into
[SPEAKER_03]: Metamar back in the day and be like,
what's wrong with my plants, yo?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd look at it and be like,
yo, that's cotton balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, that's spider mite webbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My take on it is I sold that seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it went to a distributor, he paid me
for it and then you paid him for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's passed, it's left me twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect anything in return.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only very recently was this even possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, but when you go to the grocery
store, wherever your local store is,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you buy all your ingredients to make
fucking what are you going to make tonight
[SPEAKER_02]: for dinner, some pizzas or whatever,
and then you go home and you make your
[SPEAKER_02]: pizza and you bake it, you don't drive
back to the store and offer everyone at
[SPEAKER_02]: the store, hey, I got this shit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a slice of the pizza I made with
the products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but if I give you some like chickens
and then you raise them up, like you might
[SPEAKER_03]: bring me some chicken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I might bring you some eggs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on the what though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I don't expect anything in
return.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know another part of this is a breeder
has probably grown that strain enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: have found that phenotype that you've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very unlikely that you
find something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got it, odds are they've seen
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've probably got a, we've got the
fire phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a really cool gesture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live near the breeder, like our
friends in Organica or in Albuquerque,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe if they are coming this way and
there's, they would have to have a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, cause we're legit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'd have to have a New Mexico
medical marijuana patient in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Committed a different federal crime when
you're driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but there's no feds sitting on the
line between New Mexico and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if there's that line?
[SPEAKER_02]: What if the line is as thick as the,
as the tip of this pen and they set the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds right on the tip of this pen to
where it's half on Colorado, half on New
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico and one guy drops it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy picks it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops aren't meant to debate technicalities
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're meant to hit you with the
nightstick until you stop resisting and
[SPEAKER_02]: ruin your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you wanted to bring me the con
wherever you could do it, you could,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy with that, but it's not
required.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I've, once that seed has been given
out, that is your seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, unless it was a tester and there
was an agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's been a purchased seed from a
vendor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes it seem like it's not though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's specifically not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that this message says
purchased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that's my take on like,
yeah, do whatever you want with that
[SPEAKER_02]: clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've got seeds and seeds are going
everywhere and then clones are going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: made of clones and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've, if you've got a cool phenotype,
do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be cool if you got it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If maybe if you're in my area and you've
got the one that won the cup or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe, maybe hook me up so that I could
read back to it or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm probably thinking this way because
I was listening to the dude gross show
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier in the dude gross show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this came up specifically with a
different, they were talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, hydro stores in the mid nineties and
early thousands.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I feel like, so I'm somebody like
sub cool and some random person hits me up
[SPEAKER_03]: on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, Hey, I bought a pack of your
seeds on www.Iwantseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering if you would like me
to mail you a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, no piggy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how is this not entrapment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my first response.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're in Colorado and California,
Washington, Oregon, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our Michigan friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: All seven of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the further you're separated,
I feel like the creepier that offer gets
[SPEAKER_03]: or the scarier maybe is a better way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I put myself out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody's like Ross to Jeff,
I've got your clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it seems it's just, I'm putting
myself out there so much for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with me that it doesn't feel
creepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'd still, uh, if you're not in
Colorado, I'm probably, that's why I
[SPEAKER_03]: changed it to scary immediately because
creepy is definitely not the right word,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the Capleton clone that I run,
I did not Fino hunt that that came from a
[SPEAKER_02]: pack of seeds that I sold to somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually, this has happened to
somebody brought me Ralph Ross to Ralph
[SPEAKER_02]: brought me back a clone of blue healer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does happen because he felt like
he's like, this is a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he brought me a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what happened when he did,
I gave him seeds in return for that clone
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he got more seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know people that have suffered
some sort of tragedy in their garden or,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, accidentally lost, uh, a whole Fino
due to one thing or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cats seem to be particularly destructive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you, why are your cats in your
fucking grow room?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck are people doing?
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take your dog to your commercial
grow either.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're working on an IPM program in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're spraying shit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're releasing bugs and then you bring
your dog in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, uh, the side beat of this question
was how I feel about people breeding with
[SPEAKER_02]: my seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I want the same reasons we
just listed for the first half of the
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I want though is credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you, if you release that,
when you post a picture of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: put the name of the parent strain on
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be honest about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put that it was a rise or Capelton or
whatever you used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: List it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I got seeds from somebody to
breed with, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, and that's how I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't just invent plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got seeds and clones and use other
people's seeds and clones for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be cool if you're going to make
seeds commercially, make your own parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like don't just go take and I know just
buy an established five pack and column.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I did it with daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a fucking pack of daybreaker from
gauge green and there was a male in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, God damn he's got to be used
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I dusted a bunch of shit with him and
made a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I used my favorite male out of
that breeding project from the golden goat
[SPEAKER_02]: to daybreaker, which became a rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my new male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've done some work with the male I'm
using as my main stud for my breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I didn't just go pull one from
somebody else's, but I've used four or
[SPEAKER_02]: five different males throughout different
breeding projects lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I am using other people's shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to use other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't, then you're just
breeding forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at this point, there's no reason to
reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like use what's available to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's a lot of stuff you can do
with it in as long
[SPEAKER_02]: as you're not being super shady with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly how I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you make a package and you print
something on it, it should say the true
[SPEAKER_02]: parents on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to put whatever a rise
for my re genetics, just put a rise to my
[SPEAKER_02]: new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're all happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use my stuff for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used, I've used some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used everybody's stuff for breeding
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bred with everybody's projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some DNA genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some ethos collective in my
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's some cool stuff in my
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Cali connection in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, yeah, there's a little bit of
everything in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reserve of Provada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that answers the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a little rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I totally answered them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been known to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be cool if I got a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not required.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not a dick if you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people can't share.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to grow quietly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just bad at sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't because they're in Odessa,
Texas and they can't fucking talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now they're on the far end from
those reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, uh, different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that, uh, are looking to patent
cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in other breeding other plants,
that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I couldn't cross two different
breeders tomatoes together and then try to
[SPEAKER_02]: commercially sell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would say, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of outfits that are just
waiting for federal legalization where
[SPEAKER_03]: they can pounce on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have all their paperwork
ready to just mass submit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I don't have the funding
for that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was in on a talk today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year is going to be fun people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what happens, even if what we
talked about today didn't pan out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to switch from Mountain
Dew to energy drinks or something next
[SPEAKER_03]: year, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just straight coffee and Red Bull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut the coffee with Red Bull.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, just switch to straight pods of
espresso.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a fun year next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what else we got on the punch sheet,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've done almost 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, do you have anything that you want to
ramble about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't want to go, I feel like
you guys that are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Christmas show, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a big angry rant in me that's
been cooking for a couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: but now I just, it's Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's not burn them down with the
Mike rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys that are listening on a
Christmas, to a Christmas episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you guys for listening to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just a 30 minute, just Mike and Jeff
hanging out kicking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for making us part of your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a dab, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should definitely take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not the end of the episode,
but you don't need to pick up a pen or a
[SPEAKER_02]: notebook for sure from here out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee the learning is done,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to save that rant for another
show, but Merry Christmas, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you have some good people to spend
it with, some good food to eat,
[SPEAKER_03]: some wonderful cannabis to consume if
you're into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a nice wine if you're into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hopefully you got somebody to love on
this, this holiday season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't tweet me, I'll tweet back
at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, that sounds fucking
gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't got someone to love on,
tweet me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to love on you, but like
I'll say hi on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you pet my dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll send you a DM of a picture of
whatever, whatever I'm about to dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just making it more and more
depressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't got someone to love on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear flashlights is on sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is taking a weird turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember those times when I was like,
Mike, ramble a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am starting to regret it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the hash is coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The torch is coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to fix you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dab is for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish I had gotten it for you
because your head needs some corrections.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thanks for including us in your
holiday cheer, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for a Mike rant sometime mid January.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to set this one aside because I
got to save some of that one for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and there were a bunch of people on
Instagram live one night trying to get me
[SPEAKER_03]: to join, uh, Russ this video that might
happen in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's kind of camera shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not a video friendly dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I've apparently I've got a voice for
radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure about the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally got a face for radio buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, one day I'll get cleaned up
a little bit and I'll, uh, I'll join the
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram live world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just not today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, this episode is coming out at
the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got like a week left.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you didn't do what you wanted to do
this year, you got some time to set some
[SPEAKER_02]: goals for next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goals are fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write something down, something you want
to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter how big nor small it is,
write it down and say, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking do this this year and make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's just a little tiny thing,
knock it out and then write down a bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you knock out all those
little things, you're going to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, I wrote down some shit and I got it
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write down some harder shit
and then I'm going to get some harder shit
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll just start getting shit
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just start flowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be like, yeah, I'm going to make
more goals and I'm going to do more shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year is going to get better and
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to start just making more
money and stacking more shit up and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, anyway, it just starts flowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just start doing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get off on a rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heated the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's not as hot as it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to reheat here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little reheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get a reheat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Set some goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that was my goddamn point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set some goals, have some goals,
accomplish some goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anybody that's content like
strive for better people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read a book, uh, strive for a new job,
learn a new skill, grow better,
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to more shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do the New Year's resolution thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you gave up giving up shit for Lent
one year.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's legitimately true.
[SPEAKER_03]: One year and I had a bunch of friends in
college one year for Lent that were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: we know you're not religious, but
everybody's given up for something for
[SPEAKER_03]: Lent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should give something up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I gave up my Mountain Dews for Lent
and, uh, the next day they were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, you can't just fucking switch to Dr.
Pepper, bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I actually gave up caffeine for
Lent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even went an extra day because they,
they were pretty adamant that the Dr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pepper I had the morning of the first day
of Lent was cheating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in the next year, I was like,
no, fuck all y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving up, giving up stuff for Lent
and I'm just going to keep that going
[SPEAKER_03]: forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been like 15 years now,
but, uh, setting goals kind of at the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where would I like to be at the end of
the next year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, little stuff like I want to
get this room cleaned out or big stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to start a different career
path or, uh, buy a new car, buy a new
[SPEAKER_03]: house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it can be anything in that range,
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take a few minutes over the holiday
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're me, you're probably
going to pack a bowl, sit back,
[SPEAKER_03]: put your feet up, think about it for a
few.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you want to be this time next
year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to be in the same spot you're
in now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to be wearing the same jeans?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want a totally different life?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to be in a different room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to be with different people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to be employed in a different
industry and make that change for
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Change is a constant in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't embrace it, it's going to
destroy you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm watching people try to hold onto
the past all day watching prohibitionists
[SPEAKER_03]: online and like it kills them little by
little, day by day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to hold onto the past ruins
their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Set some goals, make some change.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a dab for you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but like, I don't even believe in
like, I think scales are unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that try to lose
weight after the holidays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that fucking scale, throw it in the
trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's just bad for your mental
health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your hotness is not determined by a
random number.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I've said that same sentence to
somebody, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I spend a lot of time online following
prohibitionists and you end up seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: their thoughts and opinions on all sorts
of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see a lot of people that are like,
man, I'm 134, but if I could be 128,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, if you didn't know those numbers,
you'd be happier at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how much I weigh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a range.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they asked me when I met the doctor,
what do you weigh?
[SPEAKER_03]: I shrug and like I have to get on the
scale and every time I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When, when you go to like the MED to get
your paperwork filled out and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how tall are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Six, five.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do you weigh?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere between 185 and 205 ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on did I eat or did I poo?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times was I at Chipotle this
week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pay too much attention to it
because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, if you eat right and you take care
of yourself and the number on the scale
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you were off on a rant there for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's had you fired up for the past
few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bubble cap to go with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn his mic down since it is
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll help you guys out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn Mike's mic down just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, he is red as a candy cane right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks like a candy cane.
[SPEAKER_02]: His face is red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arms are as white as white people can
fucking get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking like a striped candy cane over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you trying to get words out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make words happen, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have to teach Mike something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can barely make thoughts right now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike looks like the 40 year old virgin
just took a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Mike looks like right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're pale and red at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you're two different
colors, but you totally are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweaty and dry at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, Mike encourages me to remind you
to drink water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydrate yourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always try to get Mike to drink water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is on a water strike or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not a strike.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got more to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just can't make it come out of his
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I really appreciate hanging out
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've been doing this podcast for
three years now or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got 272 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm cheating by counting the
Throwback Thursday episodes, but it just
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps it easier to keep it in line with
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I've done at least 170 episodes
or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we've been hanging out for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate all the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate all the interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate all the guests that have come
and hung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Patreon support is truly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys covered my website this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon paid for my website.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys contributed enough to Patreon to
cover the cost of hosting this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast did not come out of my pocket
for the first time this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not profitable, but that's not the
goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal of this podcast was never to be
profitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal of this podcast was to teach
people how to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're reaching our goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have covered through Patreon donations
and contributions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We paid for the cost of my website,
which that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that that was even possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that it would get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it would be 10 or 12 bucks a
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought it would cover the whole
website fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally covered a year of web hosting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy whatever holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everybody celebrates Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be exclusive or
denominational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy winter time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy fucking get with your family time
and have some good food season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, if you're in California where the
fires are, be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that things aren't as important
as lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got to go, if you got to get out of
there, just get what you can and get out
[SPEAKER_02]: of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get more shit, but you can't get
more people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your people, get your pets and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate all the interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to lead into still begging for
more interaction, like more Facebook
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, more Instagram, more Twitter,
and of course more emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of inspiration for the podcast
from the emails, knowing that when
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody asks a question and they say one
thing and I can answer that one person,
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you I'm answering a bunch of
people's questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you haven't had the problem that
that person's asking about yet in your
[SPEAKER_02]: garden, you may in the future and you'll
go, ah, shit, I heard Ross DeGeoff talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about how to get rid of fungus gnats just
because somebody else sent me the email
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really liked those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lets me know that I'm not just
rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not just talking at the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's getting some help from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys keep the interactions coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly do appreciate that on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just search for the grow from your heart
podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at GFY podcast on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I switch it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use my other company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Iri I R I E underscore genetics G E N
E T I C S Iri underscore genetics on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post a bunch of great cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have been doing Instagram live
videos where I go on Instagram live and do
[SPEAKER_02]: live Q and A's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do the live Q and A's are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people just ask me random questions and
I do my best to answer and the chat just
[SPEAKER_02]: scrolls by.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat just scrolls and I do my best to
answer those questions as quickly and
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiently as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I get off on a rant there
and I wish I was recording, but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: usually not recording with my audio gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I don't leave the videos up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to delete them for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the option to leave them up or I
could just take them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some reason I just hit the don't
share button and delete them and keep on
[SPEAKER_02]: moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these times it's I won't be in that
video too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get white Mike on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a little shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a face for podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also there's a YouTube channel where we
still don't show white Mike's face.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far I think I've got about 130 ish
videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to lie to you and tell you
too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's 130, 130 posted up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the grow from your heart channel on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making more videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go up slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's old material, but it's still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to go check it out,
I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned Patreon earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to take money away from
your family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your family some gifts, have a good
New Year's, take your family out to
[SPEAKER_02]: dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you'd still like to contribute to
the podcast after that, you can go to
[SPEAKER_02]: patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out all the signup information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you want to know is right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do choose to help me on Patreon,
what you will be doing is paying for my
[SPEAKER_02]: website for next year, which is where I
host the podcast, which is what allows me
[SPEAKER_02]: to give the podcast to everybody else for
free until net neutrality kicks in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep this podcast free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be free from me forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to add.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take five seconds and write down like,
you know, the little notepad in
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's phone, write down what you're
paying for internet right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just save that file for next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Save it for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right back somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're paying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write down what you're paying for
everything this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write down what weed costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just write down a bunch of random prices
and then tuck it away for a year and then
[SPEAKER_02]: open it up next year and see what the
prices have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to keep this show free.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And net neutrality may change that for
you, but it's not my fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to make any money off of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your ISP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else is going to suck that shit
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you would like to contribute to the
podcast and some people can, I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: begging for everybody, but some people
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you could pay for the website again
next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it'll go for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll go for paying for the website or go
for these little fuzzy microphone covers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of this equipment for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it will take a shit one of these
days, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll have to replace that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sort of stuff that the Patreon
covers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd appreciate it if you check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've been talking about
Patreon for far too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to feel like NPR.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with your support, we can continue to
bring you free broadcasting about cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: A real stony telethon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff's going to sit here and take dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we hit that goal, people?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today you're dabbing at the red,
gold, and green level, and we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: get ourselves... Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do the NPR, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would our NPR show be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the question for Twitterverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Twitterverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had an NPR show, what would it be
called?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't be called the Grow From Your
Heart podcast because NPR just wouldn't go
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be something that didn't sound
anything like it was about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't know what the fuck the show
was about until you listen to it by the
[SPEAKER_02]: title.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like it when we ramble.
They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy non-denominational holiday.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss life when we hadn't ginned up
anxiety around holiday greetings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's become... Until a bunch of
retards started pretending... No,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't even say retards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking can and did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Started pretending that the phrase Merry
Christmas was under a deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could say Merry Christmas or Happy
Holidays, and as long as you didn't say,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, fuck you, pal, you were fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now everyone is a little anxious when
they go to say Happy Holidays or Merry
[SPEAKER_03]: Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't assume my gender or my holiday
anymore.
Just letting go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just letting go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your holiday greeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're friends too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to send the hate tweets to
Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a way to wrap up a Patreon
campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send him money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me hateful tweets.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy your family gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope everybody has a good, safe New Year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, remind everybody how they can hate
you on social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find me on Twitter at Nemopunk15
or on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's about the easiest ways to
find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harass Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let him know you're out there listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let him know you support him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast listeners love to find me on
Instagram, which I don't really use,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you could find me there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just doesn't check it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tag him in some stuff so it'll make it
easier for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have anything else for the end of
this show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Merry Christmas, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Holidays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be putting out a Throwback Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put that together here at the start
of the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put that out for Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be back Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Monday is the first of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be back Monday with some fresh
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what I'm going to do for the
New Year's episode, but it will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case you were curious,
battery sufficiently charged.
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone just decided to let me know that
low power mode has been turned off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It vibrated and flashed really abruptly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the phone is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 7.09 and it's time to wrap up the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I do a shout out to a specific
person, but this time we're going to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: large group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to everybody
working on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of you folks working in a grow that
are keeping the plants alive, that are
[SPEAKER_02]: showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, even God, I can't talk now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're not working in a grow,
if you're working wherever you're working,
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping that business going.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working in your own private
garden, if you are taking care of a sick
[SPEAKER_02]: person and doing your job, taking care of
a sick relative or family member,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even more, or a fucking stranger,
because you're a compassionate person.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working, if you're putting in
hours on a holiday, we're giving you a big
[SPEAKER_02]: old shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to all you working people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you working people working on the
holidays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ain't got time to call you a solo
critic, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: A winning solo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just carry the burden
[SPEAKER_00]: on as it seizes this whole land and thorns
of stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now discovered that you are the song
that the morning raves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heart has its seasons, its evenings,
its songs, its songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two phases away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seas that were silent all burst into bloom
and decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The night comes so quiet, it's close on
the heels of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now discovered that you are the song
that the morning raves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heart has its seasons, its evenings,
its songs, its songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we walk alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the songs that we hear are just
songs alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake up to find out that you are the eyes
of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heart has its seasons, its home and
its thorns of the stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now discovered that you are the song
that the morning raves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heart has its seasons, its evenings,
its songs, of the stone.
We've now discovered that you are the song
that the morning raves.
