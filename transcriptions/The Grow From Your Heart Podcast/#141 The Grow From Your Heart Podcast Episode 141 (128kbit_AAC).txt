[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_07]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's

Farmers Alliance and a couple of his
[SPEAKER_07]: buddies from the CFC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout
[SPEAKER_07]: out to Steve and his friends for joining
me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in a secret location in a lovely
basement, smoking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the windows open on a lovely
Colorado summer evening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Joining me is my new friend Quinton.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, thanks a lot for fixing my SD card
so that we can record a podcast tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any Instagram or social media
that people can follow while they're
[SPEAKER_07]: listening to your lovely voice?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a Facebook on your Quinton
Spitler.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check him out if you want to, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check him out while you're listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not if you're driving, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Across from me is a local celebrity,
kind of a hero of sorts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's getting well-known.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been on so many podcasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been in a couple of publications.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend Steve DeFino.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this basement have a name?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the turf basement, the dab
basement?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the hangout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the dry and pure spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's drying over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They smell delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I walked down here,
I was like, oh, fresh flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job on whoever did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was John.
[SPEAKER_07]: John, welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys, follow Steve DeFino on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Triceraturps.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out some lovely cannabis photography
on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: John, how do my friends find you?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do my listeners find you on social
media so they can stalk you while they
[SPEAKER_07]: listen?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Jonathan Sakamoto on Facebook,
and I also have an Instagram, and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: Truly Underscore Living Underscore
Organics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have some bud pictures and some
other info on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: He tries to be modest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have some bud pictures on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Truly Living Organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Truly Living Organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check him out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check him out on the social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow all my friends here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve actually invited me here to do this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve, you guys probably remember if you
listen to the show, he is the founder,
[SPEAKER_07]: president, chair dude, main veteran of the
Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: For my listeners that haven't been
following, will you give us a little
[SPEAKER_07]: description of what the VFA does?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I hold events for vets to bring
them out of isolation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We give them $100 in cash and prizes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We feed them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We give them medicated cookies,
medicated barbecue ribs, chicken.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're eventually going to move to live
music, but we give away genetics,
[SPEAKER_05]: soil, nutrients, just grow gear,
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically hold big parties at
cannabis-friendly venues and invite
[SPEAKER_07]: veterans that are in need, get them out of
their house, and put a smile on their
[SPEAKER_07]: face.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of ignoring them like a lot of
society has chosen to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way it works is I get company and
other organizations involved and they make
[SPEAKER_05]: a donation to where it's what they provide
as a product to the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They give it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, we're going to probably have
around $40,000 in genetics to give away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to list off some of the people
that are helping out with that event?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me pull it up real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, thank you for doing what you do for
the veterans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, for being a veteran, Steve is a
veteran, which is what inspired him to be
[SPEAKER_07]: so proactive for his fellows.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we've talked about it on the
show, but Steve's got a hole in his back
[SPEAKER_07]: from taking an IED, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: EFP.
[SPEAKER_07]: EFP.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll learn all these terms.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many military words to learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, he got blowed the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a hole in his back about kidney
height that is seriously ... You could
[SPEAKER_07]: hide a baseball in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could smuggle a baseball in that hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put Wilson in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always have a friend, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that you've got a good positive
attitude about it now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure that took a minute or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took about seven and a half years to
really pull out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of therapy and then just lots of good
cannabis helps as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a good support system is what was
really important for my recovery.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm proud of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to sound like a cheesy bro,
but it's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people get blowed the fuck up and
go the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's who you're trying to help.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Helping everybody out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the sponsors.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, we got Smoke and Iguanath.

[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Veterans for Natural Rights.

[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Strong Alliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Under the Clouds.

[SPEAKER_05]: We have Iron Protection Group.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be providing security for
the whole venue.
[SPEAKER_05]: See here, the Dab Lounge, which is holding
the venue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Dan's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Dry Sift Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Glenn, he's going to be doing a Dry Sift
presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll probably give one or two kits away
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Tiger Stripe Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_07]: New guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're new to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I don't know how new they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: New to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we got our company, which is
Colorado Veterans Collective.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something we're going to talk a
whole bunch about here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we got Danny Dengster Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got Jim Blushy from Blues
Brothers.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, Jim?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got Nectar for the Gods,
which is sponsoring all the soil and
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: You shared some cannabis that you grew
with Nectar of the Gods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll agree, that was godlike.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty good, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that Sunset Sherbet you gave me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, Sunset Sherbet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we smoked Heart of Gold and then
something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: New York City Decent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, good job on the Heart of Gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been growing the shit out of that
one for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, that's my genetics,
so I always love tasting it and seeing
[SPEAKER_07]: what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that Sunset, I enjoyed that more than
the Heart of Gold, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: The flavor on that was so bold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I described it in my head as if you take a
purple Laffy Taffy and hold it in your
[SPEAKER_07]: mouth for a couple of minutes and let it
start to melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's kind of what that would
taste like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good work on that, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just my favorite thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish you could see Steve's face right
now because he just lit up like a little
[SPEAKER_07]: kid on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone just showed him boobs.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, I love to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a huge smile.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in my face all day and I'm happy
about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: When is this Veteran Farmers Alliance
event happening?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Friday, November 11th on
Veterans Day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't do any better than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday, November 11th, Veterans Day at the
Dab Lounge, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the address there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 1532 North Circle, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds accurate to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are non-veterans invited as well as
veterans?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but it is $50 to get in.
[SPEAKER_05]: What that does is that goes to the
donation for my 501 to basically get the
[SPEAKER_05]: application, get the bylaws written,
get it rolling and going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I can actually do a whole lot more,
which is going to be the next three to
[SPEAKER_05]: five years is going to be something really
crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about that in a
minute, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Veteran Farmers Alliance event at the
Dab Lounge, make sure you guys come.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said it's $50.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_07]: You heard of all of those companies that
donated products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the non-veterans that show up and pay
the $50 entry fee eligible for those
[SPEAKER_07]: raffles?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I won two prizes last time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won a jar of weed, and then my second
prize was a grinder.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go any better than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You walk in, you win something,
you're happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got blazed out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a hoodie from our friend Fox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a whole bunch of great things.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned trying to raise money.
[SPEAKER_07]: The contributions will go to raise money.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much money for your new 501KC?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 3C.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: 503C.
[SPEAKER_05]: C3 or 3C?
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was copying you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got so much going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, now I got to get this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, it's a what?
What?
[SPEAKER_07]: The internet will help you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Legal Zoom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to Legal Zoom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably going to be about,
I think, anywhere from 1,000 to 1,100,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I got to go to score,
and then they'll do all the help.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll help me with the bylaws.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once that's going, then I just want it to
all be legit for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody will make hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be like 22 grand top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the rest of the donations.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's once we have to establish people to
hire on to travel around and help put
[SPEAKER_05]: these events on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because instead of doing two a year,
we want to do one every month.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: In different locations to get more
veterans and more cities, more supplies to
[SPEAKER_07]: grow their own camp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we go national.
[SPEAKER_05]: So eventually, if we take in, once we
start taking in a large amount and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, well, I need to start hiring people
to start expanding, then their cap is 22
[SPEAKER_05]: grand, not 800 grand.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it modest for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if you're here to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this for the Veteran Farmers Alliance
or for other organizations?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is just for Veteran Farmers
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole point is if you're coming to
work, like even me, if I don't even know
[SPEAKER_05]: if I'm going to even take the money,
but the whole point is it's it's guys that
[SPEAKER_05]: need something to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's we take them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We take that donation instead of putting
it in our pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we do is we'll take that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take them out on fishing trips,
hunting trips.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take them out on backpacking tricks,
trips.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take them down to Peru.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's more therapeutic than any kind of
hospital visit or a psychologist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Having a friend to go hang out,
smoke some.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, eventually you'll have your
camp to heal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And eventually we're going to get acreage
where we can just do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys can come out for a week and just
reset, hunt, fish, camp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Veteran Farmers Alliance camping trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's on our own land.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll be private land.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come out and just relax,
just decompress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some guys need that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need a reset.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a little quiet space away from
the fireworks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: This episode will come out right before
the Fourth of July.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys respect the veterans on the
Fourth of July.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know that somebody that lives next
door or on your block is a combat veteran,
[SPEAKER_07]: go ask them if they're cool with
fireworks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're not, don't lie to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go somewhere else and watch the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't freak people out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of stuff on Facebook about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please respect the veterans.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't agree with war, but these are
humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to respect them either way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And believe it or not, that shit sounds
exactly like it from a distance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even up close, I mean,
it's just there was last year was the
[SPEAKER_05]: first year I ever went to the Fourth of
July in eight years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, yeah, it was like,
I was like, man, OK, I can do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just reminded me a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, all right, yeah, that sounds
like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know it's not real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just my wife's asking me every
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: You OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I think I'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was kind of the last year about
this time is when I first started taking
[SPEAKER_05]: the steps to recovery.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a quick process ever since
then, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've known you basically through the
whole come through process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize you were that new or new
freshly out of your your trauma.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the word for it, but you
know, I just got tired of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got tired of being in my head all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got tired of isolating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got tired of being this fucking asshole
all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just got to the point where I was
like, fuck, I got to just do something
[SPEAKER_05]: about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my wife was going to leave me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to lose my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I can't do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to be trapped in my head
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found a good therapist,
started doing EMDR, and I started using
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis with I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it's called.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to look it up the other day on Tok
Radio, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet Jay knows we should message our
friend Jay Daly at Tok Radio dot com.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, you can hear this podcast every
Wednesday at 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: on Tok Radio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are some cool guys up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Jay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't gotten on his show in his studio
yet, but he runs my show on his network.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is super friendly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to go hang out with Jay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jay, if you're listening, invite me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to be on your show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to come and do your show and
Lucy's show on the same day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one trip to Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Jay's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like hanging out with him at events,
giving him tabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, he said, dude, this hash on the
table, that hash over there, Jay said that
[SPEAKER_07]: this was the best hash he's ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who grew the product?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grew it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who ran the extraction?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did the extraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good work, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took a dab of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I unfortunately I can't give you best I've
ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can remember one of my favorites,
the very first secret cup in Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Entry number 23, Kyle Kushman's,
Kyle Kushman's veganic strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Best dabs I've ever, ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But shout out for Jay saying that this was
the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I still had that strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody wants that old school Kyle
Kushman cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's he's very, very talented.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope one day I can be at that level.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kyle, you're there, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on your way if you're not there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on your way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know, I think I got a few more
years under my belt differently,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I'm sure you've got all that in your
head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just well, you know, combining our
knowledge, John's knowledge with mine,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to do some pretty cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've smoked a bunch of hash that this
guy's that John has made and it is always
[SPEAKER_07]: quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always like somebody who enjoys my
products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I smoke a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen some boo boo and I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to take like half gram gram dabs or
so.
[SPEAKER_07]: I try not to do it too much when I'm at
people's houses and in public.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just try to behave myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that definitely alters a person's
mind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Half gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like to go to the candy candy or
somewhere where there's a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_07]: and just walk in after work and just drop
a half gram dab on the email.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people look at you like, but are you
OK?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just got off work.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you didn't even cough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would I cough?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just took a dab for any of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do this all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just got off work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you take a fat dab after work?
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoke a big fat joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't work, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: You work all day and you take care of
veterans and some maybe keeping your own
[SPEAKER_07]: head straight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes there's plenty of work for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's video games, too,
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a combat veteran with PTSD,
can you play combat style video games?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my wife or kid, I'm like,
go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're kind of like, dude,
don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm kind of like, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get off and I'm just like,
that's the only that's the only thing it
[SPEAKER_05]: does to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But warrior mode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it kind of like puts you back
into the mindset.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, are you getting like,
kill a motherfucker, die.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you really good?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I play BF3 on my PC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not much of a gamer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had an issue with video games.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to give them up completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when Sims was popular, I would show
up at work and my friends would be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: did you stay up all night playing The
Sims?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd be like, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: You care more about your Sims than you do
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when I was like, yeah,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm completely right right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to check this problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next time I moved, I got rid of all
my gaming consoles and I try really hard
[SPEAKER_07]: not to put games in my new computer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets addicting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just replaced it with Instagram,
Facebook, Tinder, Twitter, Mass Roots or
[SPEAKER_07]: Tumblr, Flickr.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't need became a little more
proactive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just switch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll at least get you somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that real?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a bunch of likes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I can't hold them or do anything
with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I doubt like out of the however many
thousand people that follow me,
[SPEAKER_07]: like six of them would come to my funeral.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, social media, man, it's a weird
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's like I used to take all my time
and dedicate an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just it's it's like a one way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt like for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you post and you didn't really
get a whole lot of feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could ask questions and get a
whole lot back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I moved over to Facebook and social
media was very awesome and very accepting
[SPEAKER_05]: over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has been a blast meeting and just
getting to know a lot of just really
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we became friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you I've been able to talk at home
and there's too many people to name off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan Lutz, Ryan Reitz.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not worried about the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys might hear some dogs in the
background, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very friendly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I met them at the door.
Scott.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I talked to him a lot on social
media, Scott Ostrander, that owns Nectar
[SPEAKER_05]: for the Guides.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, he's just he's awesome to talk to.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just so many good people on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, there's a lot of drama,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can say that's what the follow
buttons for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the block button or the block button.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm strong with a full block.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a game with the red, gold and green
color.
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dog is shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dog's name is Ziggy.
[SPEAKER_03]: People with beards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so we were kind of in the middle of
talking about the VFA and the upcoming
[SPEAKER_07]: event helping veterans.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not exactly sure where we jumped off
the deep end on this one, but we got on a
[SPEAKER_07]: pothead rant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use a hashtag on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hashtag.
[SPEAKER_07]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they know what to expect when they
listen to this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm pretty sure we we basically
wrapped up the VFA.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're going to have a camp for
these veterans to go hang out and Medicaid
[SPEAKER_07]: and get away.
[SPEAKER_07]: We jumped off on fireworks is how I got
off on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got a place for the veterans to go
get away and be away from everything and
[SPEAKER_07]: Medicaid properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to hang out with other veterans
and vent and be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cannabis is free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything.
Everything.
Everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a limited number of seats or how
are you going to keep that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to get there first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Logistics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long term plans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think once we get two years and what
we're doing now and we have the funds to
[SPEAKER_05]: really start looking, I think that's when
we'll start sitting down and really put
[SPEAKER_05]: shit on paper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, that makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I admire what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what was the CEC?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBC Colorado Veterans Collective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, city council limits Colorado
Springs now and all of El Paso County on a
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 plant count limit no matter what.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if you have a medical marijuana
card from a doctor, it will matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that upholdable in court?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it will.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to if you go up to like Denver
Court, cats to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up, Kitty, on the show?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first cab.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my rag doll.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's really nice, but she's loud as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys will hear a cat and dogs on this
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll lose in El Paso County.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll lose and you'll lose in the
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get bus in Colorado Springs,
you'll lose in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You lose in El Paso County until you got
to go up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you go to Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: You win.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you've already spent your life
savings.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've already taken everything away
from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, do they take it down when they bust
you now?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do they let you go through court
before?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to find out when they when I
heard them really when I heard them start
[SPEAKER_05]: doing raids, I just pretty much cut
everything down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, OK, rooms done a family.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm you know, I've had to cut down to
like an eighth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what you saw me smoke tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll smoke, you know, eight grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that we used to be normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: That the secret is to concentrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't be a surprise to smoke eight
grams in an episode or when one day at
[SPEAKER_07]: all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're way behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now I've got to cut it down to like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and maybe maybe maybe two and a half
grams a day just to not run out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my buddy called me because he knew I
was frustrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, man, you got to call this
other guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, he will tell you how to do it
and get into the industry where you can be
[SPEAKER_05]: legit 100 percent and you can operate to
where you can still help veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can help them in a way where you
couldn't do it before, which was I can
[SPEAKER_05]: recuperate the costs through my labor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also now I can re what's what
what's the word I would say?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can look for like now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, I can resupply the VFA with
free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So donations from the CVC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're all in house to where this is
going.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're keeping everything in house.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all quality controlled.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know exactly who grew it, where it's
coming from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the the CVC going to be regulated by
the Colorado MED?
No.
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we're looking for is basically
it's a place where we basically have a
[SPEAKER_06]: warehouse for your six plants,
because a lot of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: cannot grow their plants whether they can
and just can't in their living space or
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't have the green thumb to do so.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to provide a place for their
six plants and we'll take care of it for
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just like babysitting them and
have it giving them a place to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we will return their product to
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all they have to do is reimburse us
for, you know, our time and our costs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And through that, we'll be able to help a
lot of people that would normally have to
[SPEAKER_06]: go to another recreational dispensary or
to get a red card.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We operate according to Amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not operating in any gray or worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: What Amendment 64 says is what we are
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for that, we're we're not sketchy at
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Amendment 64, what it says
specifically is it lists out, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: personal uses of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can grow, you can store, you can
consume all of these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the last section in that part of
the amendment, it says that anyone in
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado can assist you with any of the
things in this personal usage category.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, therefore, you can have somebody
babysitting your plants for you because
[SPEAKER_06]: they are allowed to assist you in growing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we love and we love what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Steve put his mic down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was like, I am stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we love what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why not do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a way for us to be able to
provide a service that normally wouldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to be provided.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, you know, with this service being
the way it's going to be set up is now we
[SPEAKER_05]: can take in people like we're going to
take in five interns starting at the
[SPEAKER_05]: beginning of the year for an entire year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to train five veterans up to
get into the industry, to learn how the
[SPEAKER_05]: process works through the MED,
buy their licenses, to get into the MED,
[SPEAKER_05]: get all that paperwork done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they're done after that year,
we bring in master growers like you or
[SPEAKER_05]: your boss or other bosses from different
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they get to see stats and paperwork on
these guys, how consistent they were,
[SPEAKER_05]: what they're testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the tests were on their on their
cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and basically you get to cherry pick
and you get to figure out who's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be your new grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get to hire them on the spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're making kind of a master grower
farm league.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to train these guys to test.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a lot of these guys need a job or
something to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can train them as best we can and
get them into these positions to keep them
[SPEAKER_06]: busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that way, we're helping the
community even more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll get to grow the plots for the
veterans that are giving you their plant
[SPEAKER_07]: counts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you guys are going to train them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to trust your guys's grow
skills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're literally going to just
tether them to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to just take them down the
line.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why we do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and and it's not, oh, this is just
it's in the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is why.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is why we do it from personal
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the book for reference.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like teaming with my microbes,
teaming with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are good books for these guys to
read, not the the grow Bible when you got
[SPEAKER_05]: one that has like 600 pages.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you if you're going to do it
like that, I mean, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd rather read something that's 200
pages and where you got to look up shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, oh, wow, that's really
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you're actually learning.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's proactive instead of comprehensive
instead of an encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why it's green.
[SPEAKER_05]: A because it works B because you didn't I
mean, it's like, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, a lot of growing
knowledge is just through experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're giving these guys experience and
knowledge for free and eventually a job,
[SPEAKER_06]: hopefully out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe one day across Colorado,
there'll be veterans running these grows
[SPEAKER_05]: or across the nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we go federal, we're really waiting
for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really just going to blow up with it
because now we're going to be the only
[SPEAKER_05]: training facility in the United States
that can train people and then send them
[SPEAKER_05]: out anywhere in the United States after
one year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dogs think the buds smell great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just got the seal of approval.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dogs just walked up like Ziggy stole a
bunch of sunset sherbert off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you a bud thief.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, bad dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This dog's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And veterans, they can just they can just
take control of the industry because
[SPEAKER_05]: they're some of the most disciplined,
hardworking people you'll ever meet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been through three people in the grow
facility so far that have not made the
[SPEAKER_07]: cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some veterans might be the next on
the shopping list.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm telling you, they're
dedicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need a price you give.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get better and a purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll go a long way with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's loyal.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just he wants he wants to to be a part
of something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if it's great, then he's all about
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there somebody on your guys's team that
knows how to build a good commercial size
[SPEAKER_07]: grow to keep everything that you're trying
to do sustainable?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say between John and I,
we have it covered.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just auditioning is all,
you know, just trying to get some I can
[SPEAKER_07]: blow the cakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve does had a level.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's ever already on the land that you
buy?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can make holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The land is pretty much ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's waiting on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're waiting for a building where
his wife got cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the land.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a building for this collective.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going that's going up here
pretty soon, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And engineers can already come out
surveying the land.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're already ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they can literally dump the concrete
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The facility up within.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, six weeks after that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been working with Gavitas for a
while in this whole last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been focusing on grow room design
and, you know, maximizing yields through
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that after a year of focusing
on that, we can create the create the grow
[SPEAKER_06]: that we need to be able to provide
medicine for these guys at the cheapest
[SPEAKER_06]: cost possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to see the owners and founders
and CEOs of a grow be the people that are
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be in there getting their hands
dirty because too often in the regulated
[SPEAKER_07]: industry, there are guys that own big
businesses that just want to make more
[SPEAKER_07]: money and they buy into the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the growers are forced to just
they have to face conditions and do
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to compromise their integrity
and grow often because the owner doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: want to spend the extra money to do it the
way it should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's good to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not calling anybody out.
[SPEAKER_07]: My facility, I write a shopping list and
it shows up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to my boss.
[SPEAKER_07]: The owner of my facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: I take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I write down a shopping list and take a
picture of it and send it to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next day when he comes in,
all that shit shows up.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, you don't need to be shopping
and doing shit like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to be growing cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to John Hunt for all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love that you go to the store for me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: That helps me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get those CO2 tanks filled.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're sitting in the room waiting for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But too many facilities have a lead guy
that is just throwing dollars at somebody
[SPEAKER_07]: that doesn't care about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been to plenty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked at a facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, I love that we agreed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was employed by one facility where all
of the upper management were snobs about
[SPEAKER_07]: hating potheads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they made fun of me because I was
high all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a weird environment to work in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your pockets are getting lined because of
people that use this product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because on my lunch break, I go in and
spend half my paycheck and then I go home
[SPEAKER_07]: and enjoy it and come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, you shouldn't be mad at us
potheads.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're making you rich, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: We bought that new Hummer.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other part about this is none of this
is about making money.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all will have our necessities taken
care of and stuff, but nobody's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: get rich out of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only way this room looks like they
really want to be blingy rich,
[SPEAKER_06]: like a bunch of humble dudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to grow really good cannabis
and home people out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a vehicle that can go from A to B
and be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: In almost any conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado vehicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be at least a 45 minute
drive from my house to the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need something that's reliable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk on your mic, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got most of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need something that's reliable and
that's really it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bunch of home folks trying to grow
cannabis for veterans.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how long until this will realistically
be going, the collective?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're thinking that we can get the guy to
move the damn building.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that happens, we're thinking we'll
have our facility built in September,
[SPEAKER_06]: early mid September, mid late September,
mid late September, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have plants first to October in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: October is a drop dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we're waiting on a lawyer visit
and buying our business license for,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, our warehouse facility that
we're creating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after that we wait, what was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Six to eight weeks for that license.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can start signing people up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we have the tax license and all that,
we're ready to rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do already have a website up at
Colorado veterans collective.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys support that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put a bunch of clicks on their website,
share it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a veteran friend, a family
member, if you're a veteran, share that
[SPEAKER_07]: with other veterans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a veteran, you should be friends
with Steve DeFino on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He likes veterans of all shapes and ages.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mean it like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually I have a long page.
[SPEAKER_05]: My like page is a veteran farmers
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that one out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys don't stalk his personal
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I don't really know you, I don't
usually add you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get a lot of weird requests lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been getting a lot of weird stuff too
lately, so I've just been a little more
[SPEAKER_05]: locked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it's got to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you go on Facebook, veteran farmers
Alliance on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can go to contact us on our
website at the CVC's website and it will
[SPEAKER_06]: email one of us and we can get back to you
as quick as we can.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you do contact them, let them
know that you heard about them through the
[SPEAKER_07]: grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause we would all like to know,
we like to know where the resources came
[SPEAKER_07]: from and where things went and who heard
what.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a good way to trace things
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they'll know where the
relationship developed and then they'll
[SPEAKER_07]: treat you like a VIP.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll take good care of you no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve's always super kind.
[SPEAKER_07]: You, I don't know about, but I'm just
kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: We love to give away cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm the dark one here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of, I could kind of read that,
but you saved the day by fixing the SD
[SPEAKER_07]: card.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to give you a good core in
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: He told me he'll rip your computer apart
and put it back together in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 minutes, 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you get a free pizza?
[SPEAKER_05]: If isn't that ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there are problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so basically to, to keep our costs low
for the CVC, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: To keep our costs low.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pass this over to John
because he's going to read off some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: main sponsors that have helped us for the
CVC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are for the CVC to get you guys
started with your facility and the
[SPEAKER_07]: building and the land.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's hear it from these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our first sponsor and the one that makes
this incredibly possible for us to do and
[SPEAKER_06]: cheap for the veterans is Nectar for the
Gods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve has been growing with Nectar for the
Gods for a few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like two years now and he's gotten to
know the owner really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got us joined too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's been sponsored for a while by
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went to him with this idea that we
had and Steve emailed him or Facebooked
[SPEAKER_06]: him and asked if he would continue the
sponsorship and he agreed with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we are getting our nutrients and
soil for free, which helps us keep the
[SPEAKER_06]: costs down for the veterans.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reimbursement fee is planned to be at
a hundred dollars at first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, this is a record
recreational at a hundred dollars first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every sponsorship we get, we can take
that chunk out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our goal is fifty dollars reimbursement
because as our costs drop, so do the
[SPEAKER_06]: prices because that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're not in a ghetto, but I do
hear fireworks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are fireworks and not gunshots.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we were at my house, it would be
questionable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, our old house as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Pueblo was bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado Springs is getting there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I've had some interesting neighbors.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see what else.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some seed sponsors.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Gonzo Seeds giving us the genetics
we need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously we've been on Tok Radio on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_06]: They enjoyed our time up there and we will
probably be going back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys are really awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have our commercials run
on their radio show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Pollination.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve knows Ryan really well and they have
some killer strains and so they're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be sending us some of their genetics to
work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: CB1 Analytics, Steve got in contact with
those guys and they're going to be running
[SPEAKER_06]: all of our testing for us for free as well
so we can know exactly what we're giving
[SPEAKER_06]: these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys will have some irie genetics in
that garden also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course we will.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some high yielding stuff that you
guys will appreciate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, we love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the list we have so far but even
with just those we're able to keep the
[SPEAKER_06]: cost down as best we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else that we can add on there
we will just be cutting off and making it
[SPEAKER_06]: cheaper for these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time we can chop at that price to
bring it down it's just a better advantage
[SPEAKER_06]: for these guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I were a veteran and I signed my
plants over to you and then I wait
[SPEAKER_07]: probably 60 or 90 days so that you could
pull my plants down and get a harvest out
[SPEAKER_07]: of them for $100 to start, what amount of
medicine can I expect from you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess it depends on the size of
the plants we grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you thinking, three gallons?
[SPEAKER_05]: Three to five gallon plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and six of them because that's your
legal count.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, three in flour, three in veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three plants, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three and three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll keep it on a pretty nice rotation
for everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything will be numbered by patient and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be able to keep it constant and
of course the better we grow the more will
[SPEAKER_06]: come out of each plant and so eventually
they'll be getting potentially more than
[SPEAKER_06]: they can actually consume and at that
point they can waive their cost and give
[SPEAKER_06]: their product back to us and that's where
we're going to be able to start giving
[SPEAKER_06]: away free product back to the VFA.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that chain of command that's
working really well for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no loose ends where money or
anything just sits around.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're always just trying to give back as
fast as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's like, you know, city council
when they did the whole 12 plant count,
[SPEAKER_05]: it really just broke me and I was just,
I was really upset and I was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: man, there's got to be a way around this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was such a ridiculous way to do
it because nobody at that meeting,
[SPEAKER_07]: we've been over this, nobody at that
meeting wanted that to go through.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no one, not one person.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was four people that wanted it to go
through plus the city council members and
[SPEAKER_05]: that was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: About 150 to 200 that were opposed to that
measure passing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were so many.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were so many people there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched that on the internet and you
could even feel the vibe of the room
[SPEAKER_06]: coming from the computer screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching the internet as well and I
live in another city and I was still
[SPEAKER_07]: paying attention because you guys had me
rallied.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was four hours of testimony.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 13 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Andrew's part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was intense.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you said that there was another bill
coming up that you wanted to talk about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently somebody's gathered enough
signatures to possibly add this to the
[SPEAKER_05]: ballot for this year and it's to limit the
percentage of THC in every single product,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's medical or recreational,
that's 16%.
[SPEAKER_05]: 16% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: In anything.
In everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Concentrates flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to get rid of every flour in
my garden or cut it down at week five.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who the hell wants to smoke week five weed
that doesn't even smoke it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants to smoke weed with 16% THC?
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean that this slab of shatter
could only test at 16% THC?
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pointless.
Impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd have to put glycerin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be a little off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm pretty sure you're correct with
the flour because I read this somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I heard last night, it was
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's the point, whether it's
recreational or medical, who the hell is
[SPEAKER_05]: that going to benefit?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no longer medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to destroy dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to destroy everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what happens if you test over?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have to just throw it away?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably destroy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to just destroy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for that to happen, I mean,
that's just, man, that's just wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Such a waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a quitter, but if you told me that
I couldn't grow cannabis over 16% THC
[SPEAKER_07]: anymore, I might quit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'd move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to move the operation
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way to really ... I mean,
terpenes are great, and THC is great,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's the combination of both in
high forms that are just truly beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the perfect medicine right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Missing either one, and it's just going to
be synthesized THC, or it's going to be
...
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know the reasoning behind this
idea?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ignorance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ignorance is the other thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody trying to control the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That can't go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would ruin everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I think it is?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they make so much money in the
black market, like busting people in the
[SPEAKER_05]: black market, that they're trying to
revert it back a little bit so they can
[SPEAKER_05]: just keep going after it and just keep
nailing each nail into the coffin just to
[SPEAKER_05]: make it worse, to make us criminals again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of like ... I'm flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you gave us this, and now you
want to take it away?
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave it all to us, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're taking away piece by piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chopping it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that kind of what the government's
been lately?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, here, take this, and they're
like, oh, just kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just made it illegal in a different
twist with the law.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't grow at home because you are
just going to cause problems, and now you
[SPEAKER_07]: can't buy good weed at dispensary,
so go home and grow your good weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a no-no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can drink and pop all your pills,
and I just hate to go back to all that,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's like, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it a break.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people do you see when you're out
in Colorado Springs, how many people do
[SPEAKER_07]: you see that are just too high for their
own good on cannabis that are causing a
[SPEAKER_07]: problem?
[SPEAKER_07]: None.
[SPEAKER_07]: None, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of meth heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't trying to go there, but how many
people do you see on a bicycle,
[SPEAKER_07]: as soon as the sun goes down, with a
fucking headlamp on their forehead,
[SPEAKER_07]: picking at a sword, driving around,
peeking in every trash can?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to dodge them on your car right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to throw something away.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, hey.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh shit, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll sell this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you don't want them to leave it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stoners aren't the problem, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ones that are the problem are less
than 1%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're going after them and then
punishing the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Making an example out of that one asshole
that wasn't even part of the crew that we
[SPEAKER_07]: would have shunned him and punished him
anyway if we saw his action.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want that in our community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want that in our community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to be able to support our
community and be able to show people that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're in this for the good reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need to get rid of all these
regulations just trying to tie us down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, there is too many plants in
a house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if it's too powerful for the grid,
it'll burn the grid up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get a house fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's people that need 40,
50, 60 plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's perfectly acceptable in a home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can do that safely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no reason you can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, especially with kids that,
like parents said, there's one lady that
[SPEAKER_05]: has 19 different strains for her child and
it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if she loses those strains,
it's like she's screwed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: That kid needs that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, it's pretty powerful to be
able to provide something like that for a
[SPEAKER_05]: child in your own home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then somebody tries to say,
no, it's like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to the store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's missing you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mass produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like your own personal house.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the price of I don't exactly know what
a gram costs to produce at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done math and it's come out somewhere
between 50 cents and two bucks a gram,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, to produce cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just depend on what kind of nutrients and
what your electrical happens to be where
[SPEAKER_07]: you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard as low as 30 cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: What dispensary can you find anything for
30 cents?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably cheaper than that in my
house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten or twelve dollars a gram in a
dispensary minimum plus taxes,
[SPEAKER_07]: plus getting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus we'll look at recreational tax,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And who knows what was sprayed on it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows what kind of nutrients it was
grown with?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just everything it tested for for
it was a pyrethium, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of the recreational products are
currently tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: July 1st was supposed to be the date.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to do another show about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_07]: July 1st was supposed to be the date when
all of the medical products were tested,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they've pushed it back to later in the
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be closer to September or
October before they're able to test
[SPEAKER_07]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody's got to get all their sprayed
weed through for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have enough facilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't regulated enough testing
facilities to do all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they implement that, there's just
going to be pounds sitting there and all
[SPEAKER_07]: the shelves are going to go bare because
nobody can test the products.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, it's like, why aren't we focusing on
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we going after less than one
percent and punishing everybody else when
[SPEAKER_05]: we could be going about the regulation and
just setting the standard and making a
[SPEAKER_05]: good presentation for the rest of the
unit?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think if we had eight or twelve
good solid standardized testing facilities
[SPEAKER_07]: that were bringing in an excise tax every
time that product got tested, do you think
[SPEAKER_07]: they would replace the revenues that
they're making off of busting petty weed
[SPEAKER_07]: crimes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, probably not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would definitely look better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we just need some sort of
operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: People will see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will start to accept it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my wife, three and a half,
four years ago, she was like, no weed in
[SPEAKER_05]: my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now she's like, well, this,
you know, it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: She believes in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She hates the smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's, you know, she she's actually
allergic to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She tries really hard to like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she does a good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: She does.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a good supporter of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's saved you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just saved me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you probably should probably have
a relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to keep being an asshole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it saved our money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've been able to go shopping
again and get food on the table again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I started growing for myself,
it was like, wow, I wasn't spending twenty
[SPEAKER_05]: seven hundred to three thousand dollars a
month dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many prescriptions were you able to
eliminate using cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Twenty four.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bigger than you thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't mean to laugh at that,
but twenty four different prescriptions
[SPEAKER_07]: you've been through like all of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you were going to if you're having
a shitty week and you're not feeling your
[SPEAKER_07]: best, you need extra medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much are you going to smoke in a whole
week?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this this week, maybe an ounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so somewhere between one hundred and
fifty, two hundred bucks worth of quality
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you grew it yourself, we're looking
at twenty eight grams, maybe twenty eight
[SPEAKER_07]: bucks worth of maybe ten dollars,
ten dollars worth of.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, everything's pretty much sponsored for
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the nutrients are paid for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I pay water and lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And your energy, your I mean, your effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but I don't really.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what I include.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, it's it's to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I do it for the joy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a fun hobby.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the the growing of it is
therapeutic for you also.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been super wide up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You smile more than anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go into his room with him and it's just
details here and there shows you every
[SPEAKER_06]: single plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely part of the healing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's another reason why we want to
bring these guys in, because it will work
[SPEAKER_06]: for other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I feel calm in my garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to drive fifty five miles from my
house to the office every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last 10 miles of that drive is
like bumper to bumper madness.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could probably park my car, run up to
the guy in front of me and punch him in
[SPEAKER_07]: the face six times and get back in my car
before traffic even moved.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I get in the grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Green, beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of fans and it's 74 degrees and
I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: 74, 77 ish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Glorious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love to get it down to like 72 in the
last two and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, if I wasn't running a big perpetual,
I would do things a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with the perpetual, you have to keep
it ideal across the board, because I've
[SPEAKER_07]: got there are plants every three weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are new plants going in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got stuff at week one,
week three and week six or week nine,
[SPEAKER_07]: six and three.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to have 12, 12 and 74 degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've been playing with with light
manipulation lately and I like I did it 35
[SPEAKER_05]: days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I flipped into 1113.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did the last one at 15 days and then I
did one at just straight 1113.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to see how, if anything,
any flavor changes or anything's enhanced
[SPEAKER_05]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I noticed from the 1113 was when I
was doing phenol hunts, I would see much
[SPEAKER_07]: more phenotypical expression with the
extended dark period.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would see much more variation from
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for a breeder, that was really handy.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I did notice was it kind of
diminished on my harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, really wasn't where it should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seemed to finish a little quicker to
finish quicker.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually gotten a bump in weight from
switching over to 1113.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might have been that mammoth microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's been both.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you wanted to give a shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a mammoth microbes has been huge
for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That product, it has made some of the
densest, stickiest nugs I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it MED approved?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we use it in the MED grows?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see why you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a lot of products are banned.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of shit is banned.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be legit then.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll compare it to the other things that I
use.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't talk about one of the products
that I use for secrets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's just a proprietary thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we also use the veg bloom plus life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'll compare it to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And see if it's got the same stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't pee on your plants, do you?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you hear me say that?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the secret, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually told people to pee in their
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you make your plants like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just pee in them every morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drink six Guinnesses, go to bed,
wake up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The yeast makes it expand.
[SPEAKER_05]: The microbes travel through.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so disgusting with that dark,
thick, frothy piss right in your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't be doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not piss on your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might work out first, but maybe for a
short while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Guinness in eight years,
gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to think about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, mammoth microbes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve's got to go refill his water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, we've been going for almost an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, you're talking to folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were already going for a while before,
too, just talking here without.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to spend 30 minutes getting my SD
card fixed because for some reason it
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't want to work when I showed up to
record, which was almost embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's electronics, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That just happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just put it in the case and carried it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like since Steve left, we're all
stuck in a lull because he's got a
[SPEAKER_07]: notebook over there and he was kind of
running the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve's definitely the talker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's a people person.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good at growing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm here.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to grow soil, hydro,
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nectar number eight soil is the one we
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: We add a little extra perlite and it's
cocoa based.
[SPEAKER_06]: And their whole line is just all the
organic things I would use in my soil,
[SPEAKER_06]: but in bottles and pH to low so that it
doesn't go bad and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that stuff works great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Half the time, me and Steve can't even
tell the difference between our weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have like different overtones and
stuff, but I'm very impressed with the
[SPEAKER_06]: Nectar for God's Line and more organic
sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like any lines, really.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a friend named Sean who's been on
the podcast a lot of times who doesn't use
[SPEAKER_07]: any bottles, nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then he's using comes from a bottle.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I am.
[SPEAKER_07]: His product is definitely you can tell
that it's a different product.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_07]: It burns better though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ashes are as white as this parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fishbone meal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fishbone meal is all about fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's got the fishbone meal bottle and
it's just fishbone meal diluted into
[SPEAKER_06]: water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that stuff's awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve got me inspired.
[SPEAKER_07]: He went and got a beverage.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reaching for one out of the backpack
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_07]: This Dr. Pepper that's in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a frosty cold Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look at you.
[SPEAKER_05]: He came prepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you got to come prepared to the
podcast when you have no idea where you're
[SPEAKER_07]: going.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dog on the podcast.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got anything to say, dog?
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of food are you eating lately,
bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Ziggy, speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the dog like cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's been trim cycle and we just
give the dogs the leaves, the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, they're not getting high off
of it or anything, but those vitamins and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff, they know it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Phytonutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: They eat the leaves off and leave the stem
and they'll nibble around the stem and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're just like, oh, we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, they'll clean our floors
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool dogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the brother of this dog too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the black one is the mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this, this gold one over here
came out of her and Steve got one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: all black ones and breeding dogs was an
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like breeding plants way more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well my mind went somewhere really weird
with that because it's much easier to get
[SPEAKER_07]: rid of ugly plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: This puppy is non-desirable.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't really do what you do with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it's frowned upon a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got the biggest smile he's had the
whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know anything about dogs that went
missing.
[SPEAKER_07]: One bag full of puppies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: This show just got really weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about vitamins and farming
cannabis some more because this podcast,
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at the dates.
[SPEAKER_07]: This podcast, ironically, I did not plan
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to come out on the 4th of
July.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfectly timed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holiday podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys are listening, I hope you're,
don't drive drunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're out there on the boat,
don't boat drunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful if you're at a state park.
[SPEAKER_07]: Park celebrating today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful with your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're listening after the 4th of
July, cause most people are going to wait
[SPEAKER_07]: until Tuesday to listen to this since
Monday's a holiday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope everything went your way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you're safe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if things didn't, I'm fucking sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not light any mortar shells off your
chest or head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking like you've done this
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was in the news last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was two deaths we had.
[SPEAKER_05]: People died from fireworks.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, one decided to light off one of those
big mortars.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're off his chest and I guess,
and it just went right through his chest
[SPEAKER_05]: and out his back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one dude tried to hold his head,
blew his head apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chasing those likes on YouTube or views on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kill yourself for a few likes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't burn down any state parks or any
of our beautiful fires.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't do that stupidity.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just burn some joints down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But be careful wherever you are,
wherever you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn some joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis may be legal in Colorado,
but there's no legal place to consume it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than your house.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that all about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of, it's stupid, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can smoke it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in the Springs, we have great open
parks where people love to go and smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: down.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, if there's, for some reason,
there's a cop up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll get in trouble and I don't
understand it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not bothering anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a father and I don't want to be
walking through the park with my daughter
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoying ice cream.
[SPEAKER_07]: And have to explain to her what you guys
are doing when you're over there taking
[SPEAKER_07]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not, that's not your guys's
conversation to introduce to my daughter's
[SPEAKER_07]: life.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's mine to bring up when the time is
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of thanks for being there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we can have that talk is my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everyone wants their three year old.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a 13 year old, so it's plenty of
time past time to have a weed talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked about weed a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's, oh my God, dad, that weed stinks so
bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked about it with my seven year
old.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, once she was about four,
it was like, okay, look, I want to educate
[SPEAKER_05]: you on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: She knows not to touch it, not to get
close to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She stays completely away from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, she just knows she's been
educated.
[SPEAKER_05]: She has no desire for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She knows it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, Whoa, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't, I just, I just don't want
anybody to have to have the talk of me.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that smell?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that hippie guy doing over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dad, he's doing drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's just going to go down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to do that to our scene.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should respect those parks a little
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a hypocrite because I took a dab
at the park the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nowhere to dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I live an hour away from here and my
friend was nice enough to bring me lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought she deserves some dabs for
bringing me lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, well, let's go to that park
right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's why we need our dab lounges
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Springs said no to those too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss being able to go to one of my
favorite places to ever go in Springs was
[SPEAKER_07]: to go hang out at the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first time Steve and I met.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was recording a podcast at the Canyon
and posted that I was there and he showed
[SPEAKER_07]: up and brought weed for me to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arguably if it is truly regulated,
like alcohol, you should be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: consume in a public place, like a bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the most valid argument out of all
of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You try to, the officials, the legislation
is the one that made it regulated.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was their idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Regulate it like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an alcohol drinking establishment
on every two blocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in Pueblo, there's one every 30
feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's terrible in Pueblo, so many drinking
places and nowhere illegal to consume
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for in your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: In your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's if you have permission from
your landlord if you rent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how am I supposed to medicate safely
on a lunch break if I don't live here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well you shouldn't be medicating
anyways, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't rely on showing up at your house
every day, can I?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Steve, can I sit on your couch for 20
minutes, take four dabs and get out of
[SPEAKER_07]: here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it depends on how good of friends we
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple guys, if they come
through into the Springs, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, come on through, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to battle?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the cat almost fell off the box.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw some commotion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they were going to battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that cat is awkward.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, we've been going for
about an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of my listeners check out about an
hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate all three of you being
on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have anything that you want to
include in the show before we start
[SPEAKER_07]: wrapping up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just nothing really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we talked about everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we covered a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just keep your eyes and ears open for the
Colorado Veterans Collective.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be starting in about two,
three months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go visit our website.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once that's started, there will be great
things in the work.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, you don't have to wait until all
of their new stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are a veteran and you need support,
you need help in any way, cannabis related
[SPEAKER_07]: or not, reach out to Steve Dufino.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reach out to the Veteran Farmers Alliance

[SPEAKER_07]: We'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those listening, happy Fourth of July
from Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a great way to wrap this
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quentin, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was this your first podcast?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, indeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_07]: You saved the fucking show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve, we're going to have you back lots
of times, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anytime you've got something, oh,
let's pitch the event one more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind the people when and where.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's November 11th at the Dab Lounge
at 1532 North Circle in Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a long ways away, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will have Steve remind us a couple of
times before that comes up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like five months away and we all
consume a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're gathering a lot of donations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even John here is going to be donating a
half pound of his own personal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of my medical, girl.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to bring a half pound,
roll some joints for these guys,
[SPEAKER_06]: give it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to take any back at the end,
so I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we come home with nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We give it all away.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the VFA.
[SPEAKER_07]: When iRegenetics has new seeds,
you guys will include those in your
[SPEAKER_07]: giveaways.
[SPEAKER_07]: We would love to have you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't put any seeds out for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on it, you guys.
