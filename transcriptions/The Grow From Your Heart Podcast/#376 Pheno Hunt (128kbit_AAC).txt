[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 376 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that I start the
podcast off by letting you know what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a dab of some strawberry
diesel batter from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is 61.9% THC with a
total of 73.7% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff has a really funky sort of a
sour strawberry smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely got the strawberries with
a hint of diesel coming through the
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted like strawberry incense and I
really liked the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is just hanging out of my
tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could use a drink, but I don't want to
drink anything to wipe that strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor off of my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let that linger as long as it
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really digging the flavor and the
high is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes straight to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice high energy sort of a buff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the strawberry diesel batter
from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get right into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is going to be another grow
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be about
phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far in my series of grow lessons,
we have talked about setting a goal for
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have chosen a wise spot for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have selected and purchased the proper
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have actually sprouted seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've acquired clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got little baby plants going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We potted those into our three or five,
maybe seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently in the veg phase in my
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have topped our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some canopy control techniques
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are almost ready to flower in my grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the flowering phase,
I feel like there are a few things we
[SPEAKER_00]: should understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know how to sex our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing from seed, you've got
the opportunity to find males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants won't reveal their sex until
we are early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to identify the male
plants so that we can remove them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden before they pollinate our females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we're going to talk about is
selecting mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do that through a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right in to talking about a
phenohunt and what a phenohunt is and what
[SPEAKER_00]: is the purpose of phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do I mean by a phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say a phenohunt, I am referring to
finding a desired phenotype from a package
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's say you acquired a package of
seeds from the Galladank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend 10 seeds for a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do sell packs of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell packs of five to make them
attainable so that everybody can afford
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand not everybody can buy a 10
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend 10 seeds for a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation, we are going to run
10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got a fresh 10 pack of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find that phenotype that works
best for you and your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sifting through those seeds is a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to grow them out and you are
going to find the phenotype that works
[SPEAKER_00]: best for you, the phenotype that works
best for your patients or your customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also you need the phenotype that works
best for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal here is to find a custom
tailored phenotype out of this pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a little bit how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a phenohunt is one of my favorite
things to do in a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to do a lot of observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to find surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find that next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find the next golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find the next gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find the next girl scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you could come up with
in a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my favorite parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like opening Christmas presents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what is in that box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly I want to make a Forrest Gump
reference because you never know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how I would do a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would germinate those 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would carefully make sure that every one
of those plants is treated the exact same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put them all in the same medium,
the same pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed them the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would go under the same light and
they would be all in the same environment
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't want any variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all of these seedlings to get the
same opportunity to show me the same
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I germinate these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start taking notes on these plants very
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I label them 1 through 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got whatever the strain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say Arise 1, Arise 2,
all the way up to number 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pay attention to these plants
and take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see anything weird, I'm going to
document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a plant that's just growing like
shit, it's not keeping up, it's having
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, it gets pulled out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to keep a shitty plant
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to have a shitty plant
when you can phenohunt seeds and find a
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll pay close attention to my plants
as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a lot of notes and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I top the plants, if I lollipop the
plants, I make sure to do it equally
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all 10 of these seedlings to get
the same treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we want them all to have the same
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to audition these to find the
best one for our situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you give them different treatment,
they're going to come out differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know what the best one is?
[SPEAKER_00]: They all need to be treated equally in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grow these plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they're big enough,
I take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am confident in my cloning skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.9% of my clones will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not confident in your clone
skills, I suggest you take two,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three, maybe five clones from each
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them get larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a clone from each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully label your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have Arise number one,
Arise number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have clone Arise one,
clone Arise two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be very important in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you are going to keep your
plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to segue into selecting a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we're going to have a mother
plant to keep these genetics around
[SPEAKER_00]: forever so you can continue to produce
this select phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the end of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone that we labeled is going to
become your future mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure it is labeled accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise one, Arise two, all the way up to
Arise number 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also label the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: A1, A2, A, all the way up to number 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the clone donor and the
corresponding clones properly labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no confusion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have done a complete episode
on cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need help cutting your clones,
I recommend episode number 346 for an
[SPEAKER_00]: in-depth lesson on cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want a really in-depth talk
about mother plants, check out episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 315.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will teach you all about healthy
and happy mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is to get a clone off of
each of these seedlings before we put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when we find the champion out of
this batch, we've got a clone of that so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can continue to grow that clone
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep that one clone alive as a mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never flower it out and you can cut
clones from that as long as you keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always there to give you clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have now got a mother plant from your
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your custom phenotype that is for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like the more sativa dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like the phenotype that smells
more like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like the phenotype that smells
more like dirty feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need the one that finishes
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the kind of person that likes
to let them flower for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to find that one that works best
for you in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a clone, you've got a clone
that all of your other friends have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the neighborhood has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing setting you apart from the
competition if you were growing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: retail market purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing from seed, you could find gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing from seed, you can also find that
custom phenotype that works for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that works for your garden, and that works
for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, when you're growing from
seed, I always recommend taking a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: because who knows what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you grow from seed and you find
the most amazing product you've ever found
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't have a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna try to re-veg it,
which is a whole other podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have got a clone, it's already
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut a clone before you put your
plants into flower, that clone is gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a pot about two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll be ready to go into another pot
a couple of weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut a bunch more clones off of
that and have that ready to go by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: that first crop is finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have decided which one is the
keeper probably around week seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, and you can take a bunch of clones
and have them ready almost on time to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: that room when you cut down from the
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to skip any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you move along quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now our original plants have grown out
nice and large.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got clones from everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are properly labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are confident that at least one of
those clones from each phenotype is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is time to flower my phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the fun begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell a lot about our plants during
the veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell if you like the growth
structure if you like the node spacing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like the leaf size, that's going to
indicate a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real things we want to see will not
reveal themselves until they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early in flower, the first things we
need to pay attention to, we need to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from seed, you've got
the opportunity to have males pop up in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden even if you are running
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all feminized seed makers make seeds
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some feminized seeds were made with poor
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some feminized seeds were made without
auditioning the parrot plants properly
[SPEAKER_00]: before breeding with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still may find males or intersex
traits in feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the package says feminize
doesn't mean you can get lazy and stop
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to look for males or
hermaphrodites in our garden early in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start looking day three,
day four, day five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start seeing signs of male
pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you are certain that that plant
is a male, it needs to come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want boys in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girls are going to start developing
pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those males drop pollen, they're
going to seed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the boys out as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan to talk more in depth about
sexing our plants in a future episode when
[SPEAKER_00]: we get into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quickly, let's talk about identifying
a male and a female cannabis plant early
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I am trying to identify the sex of a
cannabis plant, there are two spots I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to look and I find those spots very
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very tip-top bud will be the first
spot to show you sex when you throw those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, lower on the plant where you've got
an intersection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the little peace sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two branches coming off and
you've got the main stalk coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there at that intersection,
it loves to tell you if it is a boy or a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few days into flower, our plants will
start giving us signs of male or female
[SPEAKER_00]: sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grab a branch and look closely,
there will be the main branch coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there will be a little shoot coming
off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where that shoot splits off, there will be
signs of sex right at that intersection,
[SPEAKER_00]: right inside of that little V.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be signs of sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a wart-like thing popping up
right there, if you see a little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: acorn popping up right there, if it's got
a ball coming out of there, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like it's got a hair coming
out, just one little pistol, maybe two
[SPEAKER_00]: little pistol hairs doing a peace sign,
that is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the intersections, at the nodes,
you will see either little hairs coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out or you may see what looks like balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now be careful in early flower because
sometimes those little balls are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: calyxes and it can be confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have identified something that
you think may be a male flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: mark that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, a rise number seven looks like it
could be a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down somewhere and then every
day when you go in that garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: head right over to number seven and look
at the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those balls, that are on the plant,
start drooping and hanging down,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is definitely a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing a set of balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get that boy out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that ball starts putting out a long
hair, that is a calyx and you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up toward the top of the plant,
we should see a little bit of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will either see buds that look like
dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're getting hairs, the white furry
pistols are popping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like you're making little sets
of bananas up at the top, those are your
[SPEAKER_00]: boy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may look like you've got a little bud
that is already loaded up with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get that boy out of the room
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only describe males and females so
much through words with a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility as a ganja
farmer to Google what a male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ahead of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look before you put your plants into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not make the mistake of thinking,
I can identify a male plant and then let
[SPEAKER_00]: that male go.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 10, day 14, he's going to be
dropping pollen and you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, that is very
discouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything just went to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main goal is to produce a crop with
no seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just reduced potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just reduced harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely reduced retail value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is not how you want it if
you've got seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful to get the boys out
very, very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were observing your plants and
your plants show ball sacks and they show
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs, they need to go immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are hermaphrodite plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's 2018 and we're supposed to be
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not accept hermaphroditic plants in
my garden for any reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to produce high grade
seedless cannabis and a hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to ruin our whole goal of a
seedless garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of the males and get rid of the
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not sure if that plant is a
male or hermaphrodite, pay very close
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on that part you think may be
a male part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you plenty of warning that it
wants to release pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you've culled your boys and you
think you are past the part of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: revealing sex, if you are growing from
seed, you still need to pay attention for
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon for things to reveal
intersex traits late in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime around week seven or week eight
or especially week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you push them real hard,
it's way likely to see them toward week
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the hermaphrodite
traits in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant shows herm late in flower,
you've got some considerations to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it didn't pop up until week nine,
that may be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that weed is fire, if you just produce
some amazing product and that plant herms
[SPEAKER_00]: late in the bloom cycle, that may be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut the plants down before
that hermaphrodite is able to cause us any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of the hermaphrodite plants
that show intersex traits late in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: produce sterile male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't even produce pollen that can
pollinate a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pop out a couple of nanners and
they'll dry up immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't ever produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a plant that does hermaphrodite
late in flower, if it's not going to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and it produces amazing product,
it may be worth keeping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something for you to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you ever share that clone with
people, maybe let them know, hey bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of week nine, this one might
throw a couple of nanners on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an experienced grower, that's something
I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I can deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very many of the chem dog derived strains
will herm on you if you let them go past
[SPEAKER_00]: nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it go too long, it'll throw out
a couple of nanners, but those nanners
[SPEAKER_00]: don't contain any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not pollinate anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just pop up a couple of male
bananas right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to solve that, either cut it
down right before that happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know when it happens,
it happens at day 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut them down about day 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also grown that plant enough to know
that those male flowers don't produce any
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if I do let it finish,
if I let it go 70, 72 days, it's still not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if they did spit out pollen,
I'm 72 days in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no time for anything to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my pistols have been shriveled up
by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere for that pollen to be
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have things to consider if your
plants are hermaphroditing late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's early in flower, call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an obvious hermaphrodite,
toss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've just got one flower late in,
I would think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got one hermaphrodite
flower late in and that plant is only a
[SPEAKER_00]: six on a scale of 10, you still call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a nine or a 10 and a
hermaphrodite flower, that's when you kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, is it worth that one herm or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is a grower's decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a quick rant on sexing your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan on going into more depth on that
in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are looking for the little hairs or
the balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got balls, it's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got hairs and balls, it definitely
has to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we call the males and the
potential hermaphrodites, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: probably got 40 to 60 percent of your
remaining stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants average about 50 percent
male and 50 percent female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by day 14, you have probably eliminated
40 to 60 percent of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you started with 10 seeds, you were
probably down to about five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go with five for the rest of
this lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got five plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in their finishing pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about two weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've pulled out all the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've pulled out all the hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still paying attention for intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also keeping a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything you feed these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything you spray on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the reactions of the plants to
those procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see one plant do something
different than all of the others as a
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction to something you did,
document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may mean a lot to you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that plant one and plant five
become the two best keepers out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenol hunt and you need to narrow it down
to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that weird note you wrote about
plant number one will be the reason you
[SPEAKER_00]: cull that one and the reason you keep
number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do plan to do in-depth lessons on
each week of the bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to break it down into
trimesters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do weeks one through three,
four through six, and seven through nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fast forward a little bit
through the growth cycle here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get toward the end of
the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the grow phase, during the bloom
phase, our plants got the same exact
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only got five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been fairly easy to treat
them all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the same amount of lollipopping,
the same type of pruning, the same type of
[SPEAKER_00]: topping, the exact same feedings,
the exact same pest management,
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same foliar feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treated them all the same so that we
can see reliable outcomes from each
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just like any crop, make sure you
flush for 10 to 14 days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a long and in-depth episode on
harvesting and drying and curing our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need tips on drying and curing your
freshly harvested cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you listen to episode 326,
titled Drying and Curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you a detailed step-by-step
lesson on drying and curing your freshly
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then dry it and cure it and trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what you get to do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to have a smoke-parked party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how much you grew,
depending on how many people you trust and
[SPEAKER_00]: how many friends you've got, you get to
have a few people come over and test your
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most fun and rewarding
parts of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started with 10 seeds about 120 days
ago, and now you've got a small group of
[SPEAKER_00]: close friends at your house helping you
narrow it down to decide what plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be part of your future grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you and your friends are
narrowing down which phenotype to select,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to make the final decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody sway you on the final
decision because you are the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the one doing the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I like to do is after everything
is dried and cured and we're ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it, I get Mike over, I get Kevin
over, I bring a couple other folks over,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I give them five little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we've got time to do it,
we'll smoke them all right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just take a couple bong rips of each
or whatever and see what it all tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: like, see what it smells like,
and look for what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for a specific aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for a specific effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for bag appeal?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing, like I said earlier,
if you are a retail market grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably going for some bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need the buds that look
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may want something that is
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something that smells like
oranges or strawberries or blueberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've all got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something that smells like
oranges and gas and cherries and dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: feet and gets you high as fuck and
finishes in 60 days, you just found gold,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is probably the one you want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find the one that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your friends do a little tasting and
let them kind of vote on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may agree, they may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just great to have input from your
friends, and it's always a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little pheno hunt party with the
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a quick breakdown of a pheno
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main point is to find the outlier in a
population of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do so by germinating a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that process, we remove the problematic
plants, which may be males, hermaphrodites
[SPEAKER_00]: or mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take clones before we flower our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carefully label those plants to match
the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got plant one and clone one,
plant two and clone two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when we're done, we've got
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that a little
more in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've popped seeds, we've removed the
problems, we've got clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we flower out our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that process, take a lot of notes so
you know what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have fuzzy memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke before I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I may forget some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I write down everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That notepad isn't going to forget
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Google document won't forget
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My high ass will probably forget a couple
of details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write your shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finish the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little smoke test with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide which one you like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: What works for your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works for your clientele?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing for a medical patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works best?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works best for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get the opportunity, I like to send
my finished products to a lab for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be surprised at how many plants
we select as the keeper that are not the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest tester in the batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the highest tester isn't the one
with the best flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the one with the highest test
does not bring the best high when you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those lab results are
impressive, but we did not choose the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that gave us the best result based on our
smoke test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we did choose the one that
matches up with the test, but not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more common that we don't agree
with the lab test is which one is our
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you're going to find when
you do a phenohunt, you will find two that
[SPEAKER_00]: you really, really want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be one that smells real well and
smokes real well and gets you super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be one that does all of that
pretty well, but it harvests way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a grower, that's always hard to
decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always keep the one that smokes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just grow more next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not select because it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to select because it harvests the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to select based on effect,
based on potency, based on desirability,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on marketability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough bullshit out there that
looks really good on Instagram and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if your plants aren't super
photogenic, if they do what you need when
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke them, when you and your market
consume them, that's exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the phenotype you want to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a custom phenotype for you,
your clientele, and your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, earlier I mentioned mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took clones off of these plants before
we flowered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a grow room somewhere, we've got
five plants just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you were proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you decided around week seven that
you really liked Arise number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you went in there and you found that
Arise mother plant number three and you
[SPEAKER_00]: took 10 clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that as soon as you harvest,
you can throw those plants in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can run Arise number three again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you were waiting for this smoke test
to find out which one to run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you have got that number that
you decide that plant is hanging out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to go get it and take a bunch
of clones off of it and run it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you narrowed it down to two that you
like, cut a few clones off of each one,
[SPEAKER_00]: run them again side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a larger batch of each one
to decide from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run it again, maybe change the
nutrients, maybe change something in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and see if the two phenotypes do
something different with different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will help you decide on which
one to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way you choose to do it after your
tasting party with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that backup plant in the veg
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Arise number three just over
there waiting to take a bunch of clones so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow it again forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the thing is, keep that plant alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to that episode about mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can keep that Arise number three
around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have reliable, consistent medicine
that works for you, that works for your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and your people will learn to rely
on you for that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, that is my quick
talk on pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made that nice and clear for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pheno hunting is one of my favorite things
to do and to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some seeds, you get to find out
what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You narrow it down to one and then a guy
like me, as soon as you're down to that
[SPEAKER_00]: one, you start another pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm always adding a new one and
pulling an old one out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something coming in and
something going out so that I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: got some fresh stuff in my grows.
