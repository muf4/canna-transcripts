free seeds later on in the podcast before
[SPEAKER_01]: I get too far I do want to send a big
thank you shout out to everybody who gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me feedback on the previous episode That's
right in the previous episode I did what I

[SPEAKER_01]: Go take a look I redirect calm now Let's
move into the question and answer portion
[SPEAKER_01]: of today's podcast The questions on
today's podcast did come from my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right I do have two websites don't
get confused But I read genetics calm does
[SPEAKER_01]: have a link to everything you can imagine
on that website There is a tab that says
[SPEAKER_01]: grow help or grow questions If you click
on that grow help question tab,
[SPEAKER_01]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you the opportunity to send me a
grow question type in a good question If I
[SPEAKER_01]: read your question here on the podcast I
will send you a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds from I redirect calm the
first grow question on today's podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: came from somebody who's going to be
called weed vet shout out to my new friend
[SPEAKER_01]: weed vet Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question says hey Rasta Jeff greetings
my new friend weed vet.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, thank you for your service
Then it says let me start out by thanking
[SPEAKER_01]: you for the excellent podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are very welcome, sir Thank you for
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I discovered you on a road trip
from Minnesota to Phoenix and I found I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been back into your archive quite far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that means you've been listening to
those old episodes That makes me proud and
[SPEAKER_01]: also embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening and also don't
judge me by those old shows, bro I've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown a lot but they exist and it happened
so I don't delete them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a time capsule That's how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I said It's what I thought then
who knows watch the evolution see how I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow throughout the years you guys don't
be afraid to change your thoughts and
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions as you become more educated on
things you're not stuck on a belief just
[SPEAKER_01]: because That's what you've always believed
if you learn new information that I like
[SPEAKER_01]: like the dude said new shit has come to
light man If some new shit comes to light
[SPEAKER_01]: learn adjust your info is gonna dictate
what you believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that change if it does change I'm
preaching some weird shit now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends at green dot labs
It says I would also like to thank you for
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing your knowledge and your experience
You make me a better grower my dude weed
[SPEAKER_01]: vet That right there is the the recharge
for me as a as a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just fertilized me Quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes me a better podcaster So
it goes in a big circle these kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: compliments make me Recharged and more
inspired to do more podcasting and knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm helping people and making someone
a better grower that makes all the lights
[SPEAKER_01]: the Equipment the time it's all worth it
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get better together Now we will I
was gonna say we're gonna quit rambling
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're definitely not because the dabs
I took are making my head spin today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says so here's my Topic I would like to
hear you speak about it says in breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis how far into the female flower
cycle to the plants To take the plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all you do and for all of
the help you provide My dude, you are very
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, thank you for your service and
thank you for the great question Also,
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend make sure you check your inbox
for a coupon code because you have won a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of seeds from I read direct calm
That's easier to say than it does sound
[SPEAKER_01]: but thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the service now Let me
ramble a little bit about so the question
[SPEAKER_01]: is it sounds like you've got some plants
They've been pollinated and now you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to know how far they need to go into that
process Until those seeds are ready until
[SPEAKER_01]: you can harvest those seeds most of the
time after pollination So this is after
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the plants have been
successfully pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pollinate twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hit them one time I'll let that boy
regenerate another batch of pollen then
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go in there and I'll hit them again
usually about five to seven Days apart,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe ten days at the most I don't want to
go that far to be honest with you But five
[SPEAKER_01]: to seven days apart is ideal Hit them
twice chop down the dude clean up the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen then let those plants start doing
their thing now The question the answer
[SPEAKER_01]: the question is generally from that point
about six to eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on several factors It could be
six to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on how much light is in
the room What kind of light is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room?
[SPEAKER_01]: How intense is the light?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many watts is it the appropriate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectrum how many hours is that light
running things like that definitely?
[SPEAKER_01]: Contribute to the finishing time of your
seeds also humidity warmth cold swings
[SPEAKER_01]: Overwater underwater all of those things
will contribute to the finishing time of
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds In what I would call ideal
conditions six to eight weeks and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be plant specific Some of your
plants will spit them out in eight weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are going to take nine weeks because
that is what that plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't be able to speed it up You can't
rush it There are tricks and tips you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do like I said lighting and things But
that plant is just going to take that long
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what in some phenotypes now I do
have some tips here You can get them to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish more quickly if you use a method
that many people They'll listen to my
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast or are at least trolls on the
internet or have big mouths on Twitter
[SPEAKER_01]: They think this idea is crazy But anybody
that's tried it has sent me a message and
[SPEAKER_01]: said dude I tried your The 18 six method
is what it's called a lot of people know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm leading to already people that
are afraid To try I think I'm a lunatic
[SPEAKER_01]: for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use a lot of creative words to
describe my idea here It's not my idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember exactly where I learned
it It was a combination of things falling
[SPEAKER_01]: into place now one practice I do recommend
heavily is after those plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated What I like to do is I turn my
light timer back to 18 hours on and six
[SPEAKER_01]: hours off I go to my regular vegetative
light cycle for those plants after
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination has happened Many people's
heads are blowing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, why would you put your
flowering plants back into a veggie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cycle because at this point I don't care
about buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not growing for buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want flowers I don't care what
they look like at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am strictly growing these plants for
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm focused on seed production You're not
gonna get any usable smokable flower out
[SPEAKER_01]: of this a lot of people want to be able to
grow a plant that makes flowers to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeds and When I'm doing it I focus on
one or the other I make a crop that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be fully seeded because if I'm
making seeds I want every single every
[SPEAKER_01]: single Bracked every single calyx to be
stuffed with seeds in that entire plant I
[SPEAKER_01]: want as many seeds as I can possibly get
if I'm gonna smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any seeds in there So it's
one or the other for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm doing this method, I'm doing it
with a fully seeded crop I'm not too
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned about the appearance of this
crop of the flowers of the buds I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: care what it looks like as long as those
seeds are super healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is all that matters to me So when
your head's blowing up saying those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna go back into veg or weird stuff
is gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely Weird stuff is going to
happen after about 21 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants will show signs of revenge
about three weeks into this You're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be like what is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are spitting out little shoots
starting to put little plants coming off
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of my regular plant What's going
on?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely going into revenge The
leaves are gonna start twisting and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: weird shit But guess what the seeds are
going to be very healthy very happy and
[SPEAKER_01]: very viable and when you grow them You
will see that they're they are very
[SPEAKER_01]: productive very happy seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will make All of your grower friends
very happy if you sell them or share them
[SPEAKER_01]: with them So what I do when I'm making
those seeds is I pollinate two times Then
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn that light back on to 18 six and it
speeds up that process This will get those
[SPEAKER_01]: eight weekers down to seven weeks Those
will get the seven weekers down to six
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks the plants that take longer to ripen
the seeds will also take longer in those
[SPEAKER_01]: expect that But not as long as the plant
will take to finish a few weeks shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: But expect them to go longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can speed them up by doing this 18 six
Light manipulation method so just to recap
[SPEAKER_01]: because we all know I like to get rambly
The quick answer to this is most plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to take you six to eight weeks
for those seeds to be done Maybe nine
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks in some plants, but typically it's
about six or eight weeks until they're
[SPEAKER_01]: done after the pollination of course and
then the second part of the question that
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to add to was you can speed that
process up by changing that light cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: back to 18 hours on and six hours off
again expect to See wild shit coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants, but the seeds will be
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my dude weed vet I want to
thank you once again for the great
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for your service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I answered your question thoroughly
big shout out to my friends in Minnesota
[SPEAKER_01]: and Once again, dude check your inbox
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of seeds from I read direct
Dot-com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're gonna keep this show
moving Of course, this next question is
[SPEAKER_01]: also about seeds and breeding gonna keep
the theme moving this one Came from a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend who wants to be called XTG grown
XTG my dude Make sure you check your inbox
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got a coupon code for a
free pack of seeds from I read direct.com
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says hey there much love for all you do
for the community Big love bro much
[SPEAKER_01]: respect going back at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that it says I appreciate the
wisdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just keep dropping bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you I've been having a lot of fun
putting out the podcast lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that The question says I was
hoping you could share a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: information I'm starting to flower out
some plants and I'm only worried about
[SPEAKER_01]: producing seeds with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will make this easy It said my
question is when growing for seed making
[SPEAKER_01]: what changes in your nutrition and light
cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you make if any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you much man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question I do have fun
with this one the thing we're mostly gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: do if we're producing seeds and we're not
focused on flower production is I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to drop out those bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need the big heavy PK boosters at
the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those aren't necessary because I'm not
boosting blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just making seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to drop those out as going
to be our first major change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to feed the basic NPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, if you're a bottle fed nutrient
grower person, I don't switch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you regularly go from veg to
bloom, you're going to switch to your
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making seeds keep that veg
nutrient going give it that little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: an increased nitrogen lower volumes of
potassium and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just basically what I've seen work
well for the seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need that big bloom booster
going on then a little bit of extra
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium maybe a touch extra of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in the same bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's gonna say just use the Cal Mag
that that will work for you a little touch
[SPEAKER_01]: extra and then some silica I like to add a
little bit of silica a tip if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing all these nutrients in make sure
silica first.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're mixing silica products into
your solution mix the silica first get it
[SPEAKER_01]: thoroughly emulsified then add your other
products in I would go the silica your
[SPEAKER_01]: base nutrient the Cal Mag and then after
that I would add some amino acids is
[SPEAKER_01]: another thing I would add you can add
carbs in there if you'd like but amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids is another thing that I would
definitely add to that micro life
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics makes a great amino booster
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need very minimal of that to make
healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would add that to your mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids are the building blocks of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense to me to add a little bit
of aminos to my feed for my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's mainly what I would recommend
and then for light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I would talk about that 18 six
like light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will tell you to leave in the
if you do switch out the HPS for the metal
[SPEAKER_01]: halide if you're old school some people
may tell you leave that metal halide in
[SPEAKER_01]: there throughout the veg process right
into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my main nutrition difference is going
to be I'm going to cut out those bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: boosters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend usually some boosters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say them because I don't
want to confuse your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need those we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing I also want to recommend
is the entire room needs to be in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a solid VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plant does get powdery mildew the
powdery mildew will attack the seeds the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds will have powdery mildew on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean they will grow powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not what that means at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if an educated consumer buys your
seeds and puts them under a microscope a
[SPEAKER_01]: magnifying glass they can identify the
presence of pathogens that were on that
[SPEAKER_01]: seed as it was shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: There can be fungus on the seed when it
arrives to your customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got bud rot if you got powdery
mildew make sure not to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get that room dialed in get the
whole room in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need everything beautiful not just not
just the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a sub cool used to call it the
laws the lights the air the water and the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil all of that needs to be dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're making seeds it's very
nice to get all of that extra dialed in to
[SPEAKER_01]: get those seeds extra perfect to get the
plants extra healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you can get as many as many
pistols as possible on each plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: make as many seeds as possible to start
with and then just keep those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: thoroughly healthy all the way then you
have healthy happy big fat robust round
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right let me make sure I've answered
this question because I'm super rambly
[SPEAKER_01]: today which is not a problem for a
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: What changes to nutrition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Drop out the bloom boosters keep that the
base nutrients coming all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to flush because you are
feeding seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's going to smoke this and I think
flushing is partly mostly a myth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway flushing is a myth I'm standing by
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increase your cow mag feed them some
silica and of course feed them those amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids and if you want to get frisky give
them some carbs and always nobody pays me
[SPEAKER_01]: to say this but give them some microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a bag of recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real growers use recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay me to say that they're just
my friends and it's good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right where were we also that 18-6
light cycle will help you out to speed up
[SPEAKER_01]: this seed process.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude xtgrone thank you for the great
question.

[SPEAKER_01]: underscore genetics check out the irey
genetics Instagram Monday night live show
[SPEAKER_01]: where I do I just answer questions on the
fly on Instagram all right where were we
[SPEAKER_01]: we are going to jump into this next
question here I've got a question right in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of me this one once again came from
the irey genetics website from the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: help tab this one came from our friend who
is called nine toes um usually I answer
[SPEAKER_01]: the questions today I want to ask a
question bro where is the tenth toe
[SPEAKER_01]: curious my dude what happened to the tenth
toe respond I want to know send me an
[SPEAKER_01]: update please I look forward to it all
right where were we the question says
[SPEAKER_01]: what's up rasta Jeff first off thank you
for the podcast and thanks for the
[SPEAKER_01]: inspiration to leap into making my own
seeds my dude thank you for listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: the show and thank you for considering me
an inspiration I've been called a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: words a lot of names and an inspiration is
one I'd like to be called again thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: my bro the question said my question is
this when pollinating a receiver plant
[SPEAKER_01]: makes sense so far is it possible to
pollinate two different branches with
[SPEAKER_01]: different pollen and make multiple crosses
from one female plant it is possible but I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't recommend it you can do it but I'm a
stickler I like purity I like I like
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing a lot of where pedigree is what I
really like to know I want to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that the seeds they came from this branch
definitely are what I think they are and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hyper critical about that if you're
not a thousand percent stressed about it
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't care that maybe the pollen
from this pollination got over to this one
[SPEAKER_01]: and and vice versa go for it but I don't
want that to happen I sell seeds I need
[SPEAKER_01]: people to be able to rely on this is what
I said it is if you're gonna grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and have fun with it get down to
it bro do make the bukkake happen have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good old time but if those seeds are going
anywhere I don't recommend it because you
[SPEAKER_01]: could you could simply cross pollinate
which isn't a thing that I normally say
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a silly word to me but that's what
you could accidentally do cross
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminate your two pollinations and you
could get because pollen is microscopic
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen is tiny and it just takes one
strong breath and you can move that pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: accidentally around so I wouldn't do it
that could you yes would I know that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the quick version of that answer
but um could you is it possible yes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: possible to pollinate different branches
with different pollen to make different
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses from one plant it absolutely is
but it's risky and I would not do it but
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said if you're a home breeder if
you're a dude having fun that sounds like
[SPEAKER_01]: fun to me I can't do it in my position
because I really I want to know the
[SPEAKER_01]: pedigree of everything in my garden to a
really an OCD type of level there is more
[SPEAKER_01]: to this I'm not gonna shoot you down
completely and in the question though it
[SPEAKER_01]: says also when growing plants for seed is
the drying the same as for smoke or should
[SPEAKER_01]: it be drier than normal thank you for the
time I took a dab and I gave my mom a hug
[SPEAKER_01]: bro thank you for the dab and the hug I
appreciate that she mumbled something
[SPEAKER_01]: about orange gas and oh I'm not gonna read
the rest of that that's that's that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: cringy bro I like it oh I'm just not gonna
read the rest of it so I only recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: one male is what I wrote on as my notes
here pollen moves easily you could breathe
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen into the wrong part but like I said
if you're having fun get down to it row
[SPEAKER_01]: jungle boogie now let's talk about this
other part how dry should I let these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants get what I do we're just gonna talk
briefly about how I harvest seeded plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's the only way to get this
right what I normally do is I take the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and I chop the plant down I take the
plant tag and make sure it is now attached
[SPEAKER_01]: to that dried plant in a way or in that
harvested plant in a way that it will not
[SPEAKER_01]: come off that plant tag is moving with
that plant now for the rest of its life it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually ends up in the bin with the seeds
that helps me verify it just keeps it
[SPEAKER_01]: stays all the way through so I chop down
the plant I take the plant tag it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: with it it hangs over a Tupperware bin
might be a stir light bin I don't remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the name of stir light it's a short one it
would normally go under your bed for
[SPEAKER_01]: clothing is what I think they sell it for
but it's just the right size for a
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested plant so I hang the plant right
above that I hang it above that in case I
[SPEAKER_01]: leave it too long and it starts to dry and
the seeds do fall out then it falls into
[SPEAKER_01]: my collective bin right underneath it most
of the time they don't get that far but I
[SPEAKER_01]: do let them get what I would consider the
unit of measurement for how dry they are
[SPEAKER_01]: would be dry as fuck that is the unit of
measurement which I let them get to there
[SPEAKER_01]: be they will be dry as fuck then it will
take a pair of gloves and I will grab one
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant by the stock and I will hang it
over that bin and I will pull all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds right off of that stock just like
this and it's so dry that it just sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's raining seeds right into my
collector bin and then with those same
[SPEAKER_01]: gloves I will take my hands and just mush
that butt up into a little tiny dust
[SPEAKER_01]: basically and then now I've got dust of
green dust with a bunch of seeds in there
[SPEAKER_01]: now the fun part after that is sifting
that green part the chaff is what that is
[SPEAKER_01]: called from the seeds that's what that is
you want you got to get all the chaff out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the seed or the seed out of the chaff
depends on what you got more of is how I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess you're gonna refer to it but that is
the fun part I've got a machine that helps
[SPEAKER_01]: me do it there are a lot of different
creative machines available but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: asking about how dry let it get dry as
fuck my dude just let it get crispy dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and the seeds will probably start plopping
out and that's when you want to grab it
[SPEAKER_01]: and just chuck all those buds right chuck
all the buds right off the stick into a
[SPEAKER_01]: bin and then I just give it the old dusty
fucking hand treatment just grind it up
[SPEAKER_01]: all your material is gonna fall right into
that bin you can tip it one way and most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the seeds will roll down but there are
a lot of different methods to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: chaff separated from there many of them
involve using either a light fan or a
[SPEAKER_01]: vacuum if you can put a vacuum on low and
learn how to feather it brother just to
[SPEAKER_01]: get just get the the weed out and not the
seeds you'll figure out how to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll suck up a few seeds in the
beginning but if it's yours it's okay just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't go ham and fucking suck that whole
batch of seeds up don't do it just skip
[SPEAKER_01]: this idea I've seen it done I know how to
do it I'm not gonna teach you how to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: and suck up a whole batch of seeds in the
vacuum because you'll be mad as shit at me
[SPEAKER_01]: bro here it comes the hate mail Rasta Jeff
I'm digging through my vacuum for my f1s
[SPEAKER_01]: no thank you don't want to hear it but if
you learn how to do it you could gently
[SPEAKER_01]: feather a vacuum over your batch of seeds
and suck up all the chaff and not get the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed or the seeds that you want all right
where are we what am I even talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point let's not make it a Maury
Povich situation unless you really wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it dry as fuck and find a process
that makes it easy to separate all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: chaff from the seeds all right ladies and
gentlemen boys and girls pimps and hoes
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and foes smokers growers clone
