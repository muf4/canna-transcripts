[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 355 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, somebody has been smoking all of
my concentrates, but I'm pretty sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going pretty quickly through
this blueberry citrus on fambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've described it as oranges coated in
sugar with a hint of the purple Laffy
[SPEAKER_00]: Taffy, maybe a hint of blueberry in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is blueberry and clementine,
so that would make total sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a really nice head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me nice and energized,
and it certainly makes me nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: talkative, so it's great podcast dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only bad part is it tastes really
good, so I always want to dab more of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's almost gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good part about that is I'll open a
fresh concentrate on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get to talk about a brand new
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to get back
on track with the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the fourth episode in a long
series of grow lessons that will take us
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning of a grow all the way
to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already done planning your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked on selecting your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talked a lot about planning your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot about planning your
lighting, your air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to handle airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this episode, we're going to talk
a little bit about how to control all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff and what to plug all of those
things into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into selecting your
equipment part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we'll probably need to
think about is what are we going to plug
[SPEAKER_00]: the light into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you can plug it directly into the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's going to be on 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on yourself or your high
roommate or maybe your girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely on anybody but technology to
turn that light off and on at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need consistent light control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's talk about a controller for that
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest route to go is just a basic on
off timer that you can program to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: from a certain time and off at another
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend digital timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a timer with a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this, you've got an analog
timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: An analog timer, you plug it in and you
spin it to the correct time and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: push pins down for when you want the light
to come on and then you leave pins up for
[SPEAKER_00]: when you want the light to go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you set it to the correct time and
while it's plugged in, that dial spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the time comes, it clicks
the lights to the appropriate on or off
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it keeps spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a power interruption,
that timer stops spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, whatever time the power goes out,
that timer thinks it's that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes out at three o'clock,
it's always three o'clock until the
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it starts back up at three o'clock,
the lights will come on and they'll run
[SPEAKER_00]: until they're programmed off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a digital timer with a battery
backup, if you have a power failure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the power goes out at three, your clock
and your timer keeps ticking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when the lights come back on,
your grow room is still on the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule and your lights, yes,
you did get that dark period from the
[SPEAKER_00]: light interruption, but you are now back
on your regular grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're not gonna throw your whole grow
system off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I recommend if you're going to buy a
basic plug-in timer, I recommend a digital
[SPEAKER_00]: timer with a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you get a timer that is
rated to support enough power of amperage
[SPEAKER_00]: or voltage for your grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for one light, a small plug-in timer,
it goes straight into the wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: you set the time on that timer,
you set your off and on scheduled times
[SPEAKER_00]: and the light will go off and on when you
expect it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one light, that's a really easy basic
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plug 1,000 watt into that with no
problem in most homes or they do make
[SPEAKER_00]: another timer that has two outlets on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that timer, you can plug in probably
two 600s, definitely two 400s,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a four and a six, but I would not
recommend attempting to plug in 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: watts unless you've done some electrical
upgrades in that home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will flip the breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to plug in 2,000 watt lights
into one outlet without any upgrades,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna flip the breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've said that a couple of times in
these episodes, but I want you to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that in mind when you're thinking about
building your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, no, my house will
probably be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it won't, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your house isn't special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have magic breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't buy magic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably gonna flip breakers if you
put too much electricity through them and
[SPEAKER_00]: you also start running a risk of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything starts getting weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more time you flip that breaker,
the weaker it's getting, which also means
[SPEAKER_00]: you're heating up the receptacles,
which also means you're heating up the
[SPEAKER_00]: wires, you're stressing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, that equals fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quit pressing your luck,
reduce your amount of lights, settle for
[SPEAKER_00]: having less lighting, or pay for the
electrical upgrades that are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another idea that people get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plug in the timer, then they plug in
the power strip, and then they plug in
[SPEAKER_00]: their light and other accessories into
that power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure if you're gonna do that,
that that power strip is strong enough and
[SPEAKER_00]: rated to support the voltage and amperage
for all of the electronics you're plugging
[SPEAKER_00]: into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can't plug in another light just
by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna blow up that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna short out, or you're gonna
short out the receptacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already talked about the things that
are gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plug in an extension cord or a
power strip into your timer and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple plug-in spots so that they all
come on at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do not overload that power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe have the light and a fan come on at
the same time with the power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a light and two small fans would
work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a light, a blower, and a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't think you can outsmart
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you got smart by plugging in a
power strip, and then you were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: overload that timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timer will just crap out on you,
and then it'll be dark, or it'll catch on
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may just melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one light, a timer plugged directly
into the wall, then the light plugged into
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that is perfect for one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also possibly run two lights if
you're running four 600 watt lights with a
[SPEAKER_00]: dual timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available at your grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be available at your local hardware
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is certainly available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we always recommend you shop
locally at a mom and pop shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid those big box stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've said things like Lowe's and
Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that because I know you guys have
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a smaller local shop,
go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we know how to control one
or two lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just use a basic horticultural timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug it into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug your light into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what if we want to run three,
maybe four, maybe six or eight lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do then?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step to that is electrical
upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that a lot when we
talk about these lessons because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to put yourself or your house in
danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, electrical upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do four lights in a
room, you will need electrical upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're doing the electrical
upgrades, is the time to start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about your lights and what you're going to
do next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's talk about lighting controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have a plug that looks like
the plug that plugs into the dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are sold with just bare wires
at the end that you have to hardwire in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind when you're designing
your space and selecting your controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to hardwire your controller
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to be a permanent fixture or
do you want something you can plug into a
[SPEAKER_00]: dryer type plug-in and then maybe you can
upgrade or downgrade or replace that unit
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this now while you're planning
your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's talk about lighting controllers
while we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by a lighting controller?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lighting controller is basically a large
timer that, like I said, it either plugs
[SPEAKER_00]: into the dryer plug or it's hardwired
right in and it's got multiple plug-ins on
[SPEAKER_00]: it to where you can plug in four,
six, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen 12 lights on one of these
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen 24 lights on a flip box on
lighting controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Gavita Master Controller will run 48
lights at one time, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus more on something you may find
in a home grow now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lighting controller and a small home
grow, you may find a box with a timer in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, with a bunch of plug-ins in it,
with a cord that comes out, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plugs into the 240 or it's hardwired
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that one timer will function all of
the plug-ins on that box.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may also be a switch that will allow
a couple of those plug-ins to operate
[SPEAKER_00]: independently so they can stay on all the
time or you can flip a switch and they
[SPEAKER_00]: work with the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the boxes have that, some of them
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power box is what I'm speaking of
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, instead of plugging a bunch of
timers in and trying to sync them up and
[SPEAKER_00]: plugging all your lights into four
individual timers, you put up a light
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set the timer on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set the light schedule you want on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either hardwire that in or you plug it
into the dryer fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you plug your grow lights into that
controller and then when the schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting cycle comes on, all four lights
come on at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it goes off, all four lights go off
at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to deal with a bunch of
timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to try to sync up four
different timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to try to fit four timers
in one spot and plug lights into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all easy to program with one unit
with one timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different brands of
lighting controllers available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, I recommended a digital timer
with a battery backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend something similar
with your controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do offer a light controller that has
a timer with a battery in it so if the
[SPEAKER_00]: power does go out, that timer stays on the
same cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all always advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's digital or it's analog,
on your lighting controller, try to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for one with a battery backup so if you do
have a power failure, it doesn't throw
[SPEAKER_00]: everything off schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a home grow or maybe a small garage
grow or something like a shed grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably recommend a power box or
a Titan lighting controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't recommend a lot of brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay away from brands but those
are going to be the two that are most
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable for somebody trying to get into
a medium sized grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often talk about a four light room that
I work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that room, it is controlled by a power
box DPC 7500.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the dryer plug that plugs into a
dedicated dryer type plug in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the unit has spots for four plug-ins
that are synced up with the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are two plug-ins that you have
the option of pressing a switch and those
[SPEAKER_00]: plug-ins either work with the timer or
they are on continuous which means they
[SPEAKER_00]: never turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those four main plug-ins that work
with the timer, I plug in four lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those other two plug-ins, I've got a
fan and my main extraction blower running
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's all operating off of that one
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options when it comes
to lighting controllers so start thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about that as we design our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to plug our lights into
something and we've also got to keep our
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on a schedule so a lighting
controller will be a huge decision in
[SPEAKER_00]: designing your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about your air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to control your air
conditioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to plug it directly into the
wall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to plug it into one of those
accessory switches on the power box that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's constantly on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, are you going to
use the thermostat on the air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: and rely on that or are we going to plug
the air conditioner into another trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: device that has a sensor that hangs in the
middle of the room and pays attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a few things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are buying your air
conditioner, if you plan on plugging it
[SPEAKER_00]: into another triggering device,
make sure you buy an analog air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner with analog controllers like a
knob that clicks like a high, medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your digital air conditioners
won't work if you try to trigger them with
[SPEAKER_00]: another device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's how it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have a switch that plugs into the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That switch will have a setting that says,
I want this device to come on when the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature gets this high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this device to go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the temperature gets this low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a little range that you set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that thing has a cord that hangs in
the center of the room with a thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're getting the temperature from
the center of the room instead of where
[SPEAKER_00]: that air conditioner is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can actually take a reading from
the plant area instead of that one wall
[SPEAKER_00]: where the air conditioner is sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the air conditioner is plugged into
this cap switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This switch is reading from the middle of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's going to happen, it's going to
say, oh, it's reached the temperature we
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't reach up and hit the off
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't reach up and hit the off switch
on the air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply cuts off the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's no power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has reset on your digital
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes back on, is that digital air
conditioner going to come back on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous setting or is it just going to
come back on and blink and wait for human
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction to tell it what to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the downfall of digital devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only plan to trigger your air
conditioner with the air conditioners on
[SPEAKER_00]: board controls, you can get a digital air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan to run your air conditioner
through another triggering device,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend an analog air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make the same recommendation when
it comes to humidifiers and dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to plug them into the wall and
let them work off their own functions,
[SPEAKER_00]: off their own settings, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be just fine for a tent or a
small room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to dial it in,
I recommend something that can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity measurement from the middle of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about earlier with the air
conditioner, you would have a cap switch
[SPEAKER_00]: that plugs into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would have a humidistat controller on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would say when the humidity gets to
this point, activate this, power this
[SPEAKER_00]: device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even know what's plugged into
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just knows that it needs to power that
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the humidity gets below here,
turn that switch off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cap switch then has a humidistat on a
cord that we can hang in the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can get our humidity
measurement from a more appropriate place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of down on the corner on the floor
where the humidifier or dehumidifier is
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a cap switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plugged into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got settings on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a corded humidity reader on it
that hangs in the center of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we plug our humidifier or
dehumidifier into that cap switch and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is activated by the readings from the
center of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: These extra controllers are not necessary,
but if you really want to dial in your
[SPEAKER_00]: room to a precise humidity range,
and the temperature range, and get that
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure deficit dialed in for your
plants, these types of devices are what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make cap switches to trigger
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trigger your fans, your blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up cap switches to trigger any
type of grow room equipment if your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment is compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the type of air conditioner,
dehumidifier, and or humidifier that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: knob where you can set to high and then
you can plug those into other devices that
[SPEAKER_00]: will control them that way when they're
necessary they just come on at their
[SPEAKER_00]: highest and they activate and then when
you reach the parameters you need they
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that to work we need devices that can
handle power interruptions that won't
[SPEAKER_00]: reset their settings when they come back
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's the basic equipment to set up
an analog grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about automating things a
little more and also giving ourselves the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to make adjustments from a remote
location and also turn off and on
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment from remote locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to monitor our grow and make
changes on the fly with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced technology that is available for
our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several options for setting up a
more automated grow room through
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to avoid pitching specific
brands and specific products here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for this example I'm going to use a
specific piece of equipment and a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: brand of equipment to paint a picture of
how we can set up an automated grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of experience with this
device and with this equipment so it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it easy for me to draw the plan in my head
which makes it easier for me to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: convey the idea to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of how I set up the
automation at a recent facility I worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with and I'm going to try to stay away
from mentioning brand names and
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary specific names of their
devices but this is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brand comes with their product comes
with a brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brain syncs up through Wi-Fi to your
cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set up an account, you create a
password, then you design your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bedroom, just go make
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two bedrooms, make two
bedrooms, give them a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you enter your flower rooms,
flower A, flower B, flower C, however you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just type them in and you create the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you select a room on the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a small home grow it's
probably just the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one room that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's where the next fun piece of
equipment comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next piece of equipment looks like a
basic power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a plug that plugs into the wall
and then it has four available plug-in
[SPEAKER_00]: spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It plugs into the wall and now it connects
wirelessly to that brain unit that is
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that power strip has four slots in it
that are numbered one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you open up the application on your
phone and it will show you that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: plugged in that power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The app has found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain says, hey, this is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want me to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, that is in room one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You assign it to a room number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've already got a room started with
a piece of equipment in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's got four slots on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can assign each of those four slots to
be a different piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say slot one is my lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you just, it's really easy to
scroll through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little dial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what is plugged into slot one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it HVAC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it irrigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slot number one is a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slot number two is an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slot number three is a blower and slot
number four is a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just being hypothetical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got all of the devices
assigned to that power strip, you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and set settings for the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our light is plugged into spot number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go to lighting and you set a
lighting schedule and you hit save.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now slot one will act accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the schedule you have just set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air conditioner is slot two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go to HVAC and you tell it,
I want it to stay this temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it gets too hot, it'll fire up slot
number two on that power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each spot on that power strip will act
as program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to say, how does it know
what to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's another device in the box
that hangs in the very center of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this device has a light temperature
and humidity sensor that takes a reading
[SPEAKER_00]: every 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every 15 seconds, it takes a fresh
reading and it sends the information back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the brain unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brain says, okay, so it's 9 a.m.,
which means the lights need to be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep that switch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten up to 84 degrees in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to turn on the air conditioner
and let's check on the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't need to turn on that device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fan, that goes with the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that came on too probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now your lights are on, the air
conditioner is on, the fan's blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: around, that dehumidifier doesn't need to
be on, so it's just chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every 15 seconds, that unit's going to
keep taking measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it sees that we've gotten
down to the parameters we've programmed
[SPEAKER_00]: in, then it will turn off that air
conditioner, that fan will turn off,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights will stay on, and that
dehumidifier will be right there on
[SPEAKER_00]: standby for when we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit I'm talking about also has the
ability to measure the moisture content in
[SPEAKER_00]: your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running Rockwell cubes,
if you're running cocoa, if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, whatever type of medium you're
working in, this device has the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the moisture content in your
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you can set up automated
irrigation when the plants reach a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put these little sticks in your medium
and you calibrate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They link up to the water content sensor
controller, which wirelessly hooks up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain, which wirelessly relays to your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that moisture content meter is
constantly, every 15 seconds, taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meter in your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sending that reading up to the little
brain, which is sending it back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: main brain, which is sending it to your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have the equipment installed,
you can go to that room, you can open the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation tab on your phone, and you can
tell it to water that room when it gets to
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell it to water for a certain
amount of time or until it reaches a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the way you would do that,
you would plug your irrigation pump into
[SPEAKER_00]: that power strip I spoke of earlier or you
can add another one of their specified
[SPEAKER_00]: power strips that syncs up wirelessly to
the brain, which then syncs wirelessly to
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you plug your irrigation pump into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the irrigation tab in the
application and you tell it when to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the plants get dry,
it simply sends electricity to plug number
[SPEAKER_00]: four or whichever plug you assigned as
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll activate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets wet enough, it will know
because it's got a moisture content sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: in your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will say, wet enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll send a signal to the brain and
it will discontinue powering your
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a lot of ways to irrigate
your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're running a flood and drain
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will just tell it when to flood
and drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're running pots with an
automated drip system like we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you do it, basically, you are just
triggering the pump to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it knows when to come on because we've
got those moisture content sensors pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: into our medium at specified intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the unit I'm talking about allows you
to have six different water probes in
[SPEAKER_00]: different locations hooked up to one unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are six wired probes that go back
to one unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one unit then wirelessly sends the
data back to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brain relays it to your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we've dialed in automated
lighting, automated air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: automated dehumidification and
humidification, and now we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: automated irrigation, we have almost got a
fully automated grow room with very basic
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and honestly not a huge budget
if you shop smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's exciting to get everything
automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it all dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it just to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun watching the machine happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just stand in the corner of the
grow room and look at a timer and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: so in about 10 seconds, and you would know
that that's gonna switch off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing's gonna go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bells are gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whistles are gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a big game of mousetrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels really great to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all that being said, some of my
favorite advice is keep it simple,
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I'm calling you stupid,
but that's the way the saying goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that feel better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to make everything
elaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small grow does not need a lot of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more electronics you have,
the more knobs and dials and bells and
[SPEAKER_00]: whistles you've got, the more shit can go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a light and a fan and an air
conditioner and some way to pull stale air
[SPEAKER_00]: and heat out of that room, you have got
all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it is fun to trick out the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to have accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to have toys, and it's also going
to improve your quality if you dial it in
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spend money on a bunch of toys just
to have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what's necessity, and think
about the order in which you need your new
[SPEAKER_00]: toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna kind of skip off of my notes
here, and I'm gonna say, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: spending a whole bunch of money on some
automation, why not buy yourself a better
[SPEAKER_00]: pH pen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna talk later about pH pens and
EC meters, but now's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of spending a lot of money on
automation, you need a quality pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are gonna look like shit
without proper pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're putting together a budget and
you're trying to include auto-watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to decide between a quality
pH pen or maybe some fancy auto-watering
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, I highly recommend you go with a
good pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add auto-watering later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy fancier toys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on a tight budget, get the
necessities first, and then we can expand
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the right stuff,
you're not gonna have a quality product,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's all going to be a giant waste of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've talked about controlling
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that I wanna include,
but I'm not sure where it fits in,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm just gonna tag it in right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about CO2 augmentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you wanna add CO2 to your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably going to require you
making extra trips to either the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store or the commercial store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial gas place, our local place
here, is called Airgas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to buy or rent a
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to get that refilled as
frequently as you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how often it's going to need
to be refilled in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how well-sealed your room is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much CO2 your room starts
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much CO2 you're trying to
get it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how often you'll need your
containers filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for CO2 augmentation, you're going to
need either those big tanks or a CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: burner, which will have to be hardwired
into your natural gas line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tanks are probably the easiest way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to get the tanks, get them to
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not an able-bodied person,
this could be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger tanks are hard for me to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller tanks are not light either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got the tanks to the room,
now you require a regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This screws onto the nozzle on the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be obvious when you've got the tank
and the regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You screw on the regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of knobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to open the tank, turn the gas
onto the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to be flowing to the
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That regulator has a valve you can turn
that will allow gas to flow through the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lines that attach to the
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang those lines high in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hang them right about the height
of the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is a gas that is heavier than oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That CO2 is going to pump through those
lines and it will fall right down onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and become available for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do we know how much CO2 is in the
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when CO2 gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a CO2 monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a standalone CO2 monitor or
this will work right into the automated
[SPEAKER_00]: system I was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a tab for CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a CO2 monitor, whether a
standalone unit or unit that's combined
[SPEAKER_00]: with our other monitoring and triggering
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your more expensive CO2 monitors will
also have a CO2 controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 controller work very similarly to
the cap controllers I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different brands and
styles available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them will have a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that screen you can set the level that
you want the CO2 to reach in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the more advanced models will also
give you the option to set a schedule so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it comes on only when the lights are
on and it does not come on when the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to add CO2 when the lights
are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to set the level you
want the CO2 to reach and you'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to set a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this CO2 monitor has a cord hanging
off of it which plugs into the wall or
[SPEAKER_00]: your power source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plug that plugs into the wall has
a piggyback that you can just plug your
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 regulator directly into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that thing is going to monitor the
level of CO2 in the room and when it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity triggered to the CO2 regulator
it will just fire up and let the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator know to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 regulator will pump gas down those
lines that you've got hung above the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that CO2 regulator says oh
it's enough it'll turn that right off for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the best way in my opinion to
set up CO2 in a small grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very similar to the way it's done
in a large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the same lines above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the lines are much longer and of
course we're not running to the grow store
[SPEAKER_00]: to refill our canisters all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a truck that comes and they
actually link up to a giant set of
[SPEAKER_00]: canisters outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about a dozen six foot tall
canisters outside that the truck fills for
[SPEAKER_00]: us that lasts about half a week maybe a
little less depending on how many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms are in full flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very similar to the way it's done
in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you don't want to use the CO2
monitor I understand they're expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the regulator on a timer but
when you do that how do you know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if you even need to add
CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if you haven't overdone it
and you're not wasting CO2 at this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a CO2 monitor is really worth the
money you're going to spend because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can save on CO2 in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be wasting CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't just be blasting CO2 into the
room and wondering what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like knowing what's happening in my grow
rooms if they're big, if they're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always better to take good notes and
understand what is happening in there
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just blasting something that
you're paying a lot of money for and not
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding any type of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm paying money for CO2 I would
like to have a CO2 monitor just to see
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of number go up, just to see my
money turn into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's just a number on that monitor
I want to see some kind of result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my quick sidebar on CO2
augmentation and CO2 equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that fit perfectly right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this series of grow lessons is
off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some goals in mind for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to expect from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where to put the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good understanding of what
equipment we need for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to set up our lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to set up our air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand what type of humidifier and
dehumidifier we might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good understanding of how to
set up our CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are off to a really good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode I plan to talk about
selecting the appropriate pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, and nutrients for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that we'll work our way into
integrated pest management.
