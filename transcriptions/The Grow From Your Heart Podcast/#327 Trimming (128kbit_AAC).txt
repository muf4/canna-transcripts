[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 327 of the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me You know,
I like to start the episode off by letting
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I'm smoking on today I'm
taking dabs of this New York City D So
[SPEAKER_00]: ambrosia batter from apothecary farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a nice smell right now This
stuff smells like like diesel fuel with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of lemons Maybe a hint of
oranges and then there's kind of a sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: tart sort of smell on top of it that I
really enjoy One thing about the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: City diesel ambrosia batter here that I'm
smoking on My eyes really don't get red
[SPEAKER_00]: when I smoke I can smoke and I don't get
red-eyed But when I take one dab of this
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City diesel, my eyes go fully
bloodshot red I'm not sure what does it
[SPEAKER_00]: but I get super red I get super head hide
from it and I really enjoy it and if that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't enough I've been adding this sour
amnesia High cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract into the mix and it just adds a
really a nice it's like turbo charging my
[SPEAKER_00]: dab It is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the lung expansion and the flavor
from the New York City diesel then you put
[SPEAKER_00]: the High cannabinoid full spectrum extract
on top and it really makes it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: turbocharged dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in the mood for a podcast you guys
I feel super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into a podcast this episode is
going to be all about trimming your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to tell when the plants
are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to cut them down We've
learned how to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned how to hang them until they're
ready to snap We know pretty well how to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and cure now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about trimming our plants Now
there are two different ways you can trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's wet trim and there is dry trim I
definitely prefer dry trim and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say why is dry trim better?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think dry trim is better because it's
less sticky and it's much easier to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with It's also less work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are gonna fall off All you
have to do is just brush them with your
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb Maybe touch them with the scissors
and those brittle leaves will come right
[SPEAKER_00]: off of there The buds have dried and
tightened up and it's a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious for a new trimmer what to take off
You just want to take off that fluffy
[SPEAKER_00]: outside shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little less work It's less
sticky and there's also less chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: ruin your buds by Improperly storing them
a lot of people once the buds are trimmed
[SPEAKER_00]: if they wet trim They like to just shove
them into a container or a package And
[SPEAKER_00]: then those wet buds go into a container
and that's when they get ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not even gonna let that happen
We're gonna let the buds dry then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna trim them then we'll put them in a
container Now a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_00]: listened to the dry and curing episode You
may be trimming these buds before they go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the jar for a cure You may be
trimming these buds after they've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cure jar for a little while It's all
the same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves should be similar in dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should just be popping right off of
there You might not even need scissors for
[SPEAKER_00]: this Sometimes when I'm dry trimming the
only thing I use my scissors for is for
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting the plant into smaller pieces and
cutting the sticks out and cutting the
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger buds down to smaller buds Now let's
talk about a few preparations we can make
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few items we can have to create a
comfortable and successful trim
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for ourselves Trimming sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a long time You're
sitting in a chair with your elbows up
[SPEAKER_00]: high staring straight into something for a
long time your neck your elbows your eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: your back that stuff all gets sore and
tired, so Let's try to make it as
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have a nice clean space I've got
this table where I like to do my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean the whole table off There's
nothing on the table except my Dr. Pepper
[SPEAKER_00]: and some trim supplies Maybe my phone for
some entertainment, but it's just there
[SPEAKER_00]: for music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna be touching it Don't have
your phone out if you're trimming your
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fucking distracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will slow you down It'll take twice as
long put on a podcast hit play start
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I like to have the table nice and
clean I don't need shit in my way I need
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe my scissors for cutting my buds into
smaller pieces and then just a few basic
[SPEAKER_00]: essentials and we'll talk about those a
nice clean space I also Like a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be sitting there for a while
get a cozy chair So a nice clean workspace
[SPEAKER_00]: and a cozy chair are super important for
me for trimming But then you need some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of entertainment Hopefully you got
somebody there to talk to usually I got
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike or somebody around to bullshit with
some sort of conversation makes trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: go much more smoothly But if you don't
have that option put on a podcast you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put on a podcast Of course,
I recommend old episodes of the grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart podcast put on some Joe Rogan
something like that Maybe a YouTube video
[SPEAKER_00]: something To entertain yourself to listen
to but nothing to look at back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to trim all around the TV and we
would watch YouTube videos and trim I
[SPEAKER_00]: found that that is super distracting Don't
watch videos people will put their fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors down and you'll catch them Just
watching TV if you're paying people to
[SPEAKER_00]: trim don't have a TV in the room podcasts,
maybe some stand-up comedy It's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: get everybody on the same page when it
comes to music But maybe play some good
[SPEAKER_00]: music Just some sort of stuff to make it
comfortable and help the time pass without
[SPEAKER_00]: your brain going crazy is what I'm getting
at you guys So you got a clean space you
[SPEAKER_00]: got a chair Sit in you got a good YouTube
video on you got a podcast going so now
[SPEAKER_00]: you're cozy your mind is entertained Now
you need some gloves put some rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves on you want to wear gloves in your
trimming You're going to get extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky You don't want to have to itch your
face and have to go wash your hands just
[SPEAKER_00]: to scratch your face You're gonna be your
hands are gonna be covered in trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: and resin you guys wear gloves Also,
you need some good scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the little tiny Fiskars diamond tip
scissors that you get you can they're
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive at the grow store They're
cheaper at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them in the craft store section
right the craft section at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all of Hobby Lobby They sell them
in the fabric section over by the fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Fiskars diamond tip titanium
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like those they work really well
for trimming They're super light get
[SPEAKER_00]: something with the spring in it that opens
on its own because you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be opening and closing scissors You
don't want the kind of scissors that have
[SPEAKER_00]: loops that go around your fingers because
you're gonna be cutting for so long Those
[SPEAKER_00]: little loops around your fingers are gonna
dig into you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want lightweight super fast
trimming shears They're easy to find and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get yourselves two pairs So that you
can set one in the rubbing alcohol to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean off You can dirty up another pair
swap them out real quick not have to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of time cleaning your scissors So
you need some good gloves some good
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors, then you need some containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a container for untrimmed buds I
recommend a five gallon bucket for the
[SPEAKER_00]: untrimmed buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have that much herb Maybe
something smaller will work then you need
[SPEAKER_00]: another container for trimmed buds Then
you need another container for a savable
[SPEAKER_00]: trim and then we need another container
for waste so you need trimmed buds
[SPEAKER_00]: untrimmed buds usable trim and waste a
Couple other things I'm gonna recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're gonna say why the hell would he
recommend this for a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend either some coconut oil
or some baby oil for your trim session.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna say why do we need that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is why when your fingers and hands
and arms get all sticky You can use the
[SPEAKER_00]: coconut oil or the baby oil to remove the
trichomes That's right If your hands are
[SPEAKER_00]: all covered in resin My thing is that my
arms get covered in resin because I'm the
[SPEAKER_00]: one cutting down the plants I'm reaching
in there and playing with them and
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying them around my arm hair and shit
gets all coated in trichomes and and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: resin so I use the coconut oil or baby oil
to just rub up on my arms and Rub that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit right off and all the resin comes
right off and then you're not all sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so that's a basic breakdown of
things that you're going to need for your
[SPEAKER_00]: trim session You need a nice clean space
in which to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a nice cozy chair in which to sit
Need a good podcast to listen to probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need some gloves You need
scissors then you need your containers
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've got your cleanup supplies now
Let's talk about doing the manual work
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully a few days before Harvest you
went in and did a pre harvest defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: now what I mean by that is while the
plants are still alive While you're
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing anywhere between I don't know
seven days before harvest up to the day of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest You can go in there and just start
pulling off all of the big leaves The
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are done growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just flushing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just finishing up the trichomes
are ripening up You don't need all that
[SPEAKER_00]: excess leaf in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go ahead and tear all that leaf
out of the room Having a pre harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation session will save you a lot of
time when it comes time to trim because
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that Long straggly leaf is already
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even there to deal with it's
already been removed and it will also help
[SPEAKER_00]: your drying and curing time So go in and
pull off all the big leaves before you
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest then it's harvest time I've done a
highly detailed harvest episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't listened to that go listen
to that then come catch up At the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the harvest episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're left with our plants hanging upside
down in a controlled environment Now we
[SPEAKER_00]: want those plants to get to where the
sticks snap once the sticks get snappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start trimming you can also Start
trimming them after they've been in their
[SPEAKER_00]: cure containers for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like dry trim I'm just waiting for the
buds to be dry enough to where the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just Flake right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still gonna be moisture inside
those buds There's moisture in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: But the outside is dry enough to where you
can just kind of knock the buds off the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves off the buds with your thumb I'm
making a little motion with my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of looks like I'm playing a
video game Like I've got a game controller
[SPEAKER_00]: in my hand, but my hands are really close
together in my mind I'm just holding that
[SPEAKER_00]: little bud with my four fingers or maybe
with my left hand and I'm just Knocking
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves off with my right hand just
like I'm just it looks like I'm playing a
[SPEAKER_00]: video game I'm just holding the bud and
just Rubbing the leaves right off if you
[SPEAKER_00]: hold it with the bud facing up if you rub
down those leaves will just rub right off
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see what I'm talking about when you
figure out the technique you go man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so easy So my point is that I want
it to where the buds are dry I want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to just knock those leaves right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is how I actually do my trimming
Whenever I'm working with the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one of trimming is put on some
rubber gloves I like the six millimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: nitride I don't care if they're black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if they're blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just care that they fit and that they're
comfortable So glove up I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get all sticky and also I don't want to
get my skin all over the buds So step one
[SPEAKER_00]: is glove up Step two of trimming is to
knock all of the buds off of the sticks
[SPEAKER_00]: into a five gallon bucket This makes it so
much easier Just go and get every bud off
[SPEAKER_00]: the sticks into a bucket and then discard
all the sticks now You've compressed your
[SPEAKER_00]: work into a much smaller space It looks
way less overwhelming and you can see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got ahead of you You've got a five
gallon bucket filled with buds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to trim It doesn't look like this big
sprawl of branches and leaves and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a bucket It's way less intimidating
and you can get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knock all the buds into a bucket Maybe
you can use just a small bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can use something smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much you grew Maybe you
need five buckets I hope you need 10 or 25
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon buckets, but find the container
That's the right size for what you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon bucket from Home Depot or
Lowe's is really affordable and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable so I like to use The buckets so
I knock every bud into a bucket now I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a five gallon bucket full of buds My
next step is just to reach in grab the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: off the top and start trimming now I'll
actually start talking about trimming a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and the actual trimming of the
bud process The idea is to knock or cut
[SPEAKER_00]: off all of the excessive leaves and stems
and give yourself a nice Pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: presentable, but you guys know what a good
trimmed bud looks like when they start
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're covered in leaves It's our job to
knock those Leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to smoke leaves leaves
contain chlorophyll leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't taste good leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get you high What we want is a nice
frosty green nugget So once you guys get
[SPEAKER_00]: started trimming, you'll see what's leaf
material and what is a usable bud Once you
[SPEAKER_00]: start digging in there and just start
knocking off some of the leaf You'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: that bud in the middle and it will start
to become very obvious what you do and do
[SPEAKER_00]: not trim If your buds are kind of airy and
fluffy don't trim too deeply just knock
[SPEAKER_00]: off the leaves I like to grab the bud by
the base by that little Stick at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the bud and just use my thumb to
push the leaves off I just kind of spin
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud in a circle with my left hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will turn it I'm looking that's
counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is clockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it
comes toward me I'll use my right thumb
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using my left hand to spin the bud
toward me and as that one side come
[SPEAKER_00]: towards me comes toward me My thumb just
knocks the leaves off right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wiping them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm just just scraping the leaves off
They're so dry that they knock off on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own and don't press so hard that
you're fucking up the shape of the bud and
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking off trichomes you can do This
really gently you'll find the technique
[SPEAKER_00]: after you do it a few times It'll be
really comfortable and you'll get really
[SPEAKER_00]: fast at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to do this with
scissors They'll hold it in their left
[SPEAKER_00]: hand and they'll take their scissors and
just turn it and trim it The leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking off horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep your scissors horizontal You can
get adjust your angle as you need and just
[SPEAKER_00]: spin that bud and keep cutting just like
you're giving it a haircut You just want
[SPEAKER_00]: to take off those leaves and leave that
bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just knock off the leaves Don't carve
too deeply into the buds and don't squish
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds while you're trimming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't squeeze them super hard And try not
to handle them too much a little tiny bud
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't need a lot of handling You don't
want to get all those trichomes on your
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves You want to leave the trichomes on
the bud so you can use scissors if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want I like my thumbs for most trimming
you guys The little edge of my thumb and
[SPEAKER_00]: my thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mastered that technique I knock off
the little leaves and cut the big buds
[SPEAKER_00]: into smaller sizes If you guys can see a
stick in there and it's like one bud and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a little stick and another bud Take
that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to buy a stick connoisseur
quality bud is taken down To the small
[SPEAKER_00]: part if you want to leave your buds in big
buds, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you I like them smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't want to buy a big
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see people I don't know you'll have
some customers that want big buds I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to have people that just wanted big buds
and then some people know better They're
[SPEAKER_00]: like man I don't want to buy that quarter
That one one bud that weighs a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know right up the middle of it
is a gram of stick and I'm getting ripped
[SPEAKER_00]: off So some people want it some people
don't that's up to you so once you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: it trimmed up to the size you want it and
the The amount of trim you want I cut off
[SPEAKER_00]: all the little leaves at the bottom also
There's like a lot of people leave little
[SPEAKER_00]: cabbagey looking leaves at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut that shit off I call it cabbage and
I also take out the handlebar sticks on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom You're gonna have the branch
that the bud was actually stuck to the
[SPEAKER_00]: branch too And then there's two little
sticks that come out that those first
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves were attached to and they're all
dry and shitty looking cut those off of
[SPEAKER_00]: there if you've got a pound of weed and
You've got all those little tiny sticks in
[SPEAKER_00]: there Those little sticks make your pound
look like shit just take it out and your
[SPEAKER_00]: pound is gonna look so much better It's
gonna be so much more desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna get you more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so that's the bottom line here
trim it and it's worth more money So take
[SPEAKER_00]: off all the leaves take off that little
stick at the bottom knock off all the
[SPEAKER_00]: crow's feet If you've got a little tiny
pointy leaf sticking out of somewhere cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that out or knock it off with your thumb
Those little triangle leaves make you look
[SPEAKER_00]: lazy If you did a whole good job on most
of the bud and you just left one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: little triangles at the tip You look lazy
take that stuff out of there So while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this all the trimming work I trim
over a tray or a container To catch what I
[SPEAKER_00]: trim off all that little stuff that gets
clipped off is going to be used to make
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates or edibles in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gather all that stuff up take care of
it Don't just don't trim into the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sweep it up Don't trim onto the
table and then scoop it up trim onto a
[SPEAKER_00]: tray trim into a container so that it is
kept clean so it's treated with respect
[SPEAKER_00]: because it may go into edibles and Things
that you're gonna eat need to be treated
[SPEAKER_00]: with respect things You're gonna smoke
need to be treated with respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gather this stuff up and vacuum seal it
I like that To keep the trim in a vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed bag in the dark until I'm able to
use it get that to your Extractor as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can now the sticks Those are thrown
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw all the sticks away in a
commercial grow They're thrown away in a
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow those should go to the compost
pile or they could be burned or something
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sticks are trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to extract sticks you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a waste of energy You're not gonna
get anything out of it And also if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding the sticks to the trim,
you're just making the hash worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not making it better What goes in
comes out and if you just put shit in to
[SPEAKER_00]: make more you're gonna get more but it's
gonna be shit so Gather up all your trim
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuum seal the trim keep the trim in a
dark place and get that to somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: can turn that into concentrates for you
also if you've got like Yellow or brown or
[SPEAKER_00]: funky leaves that are falling off as
you're trimming separate those pull those
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the trim Don't send that to the
extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna make your hash dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna make your hash taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna Make it less potent and it's
gonna make it less desirable So do a
[SPEAKER_00]: little work clean it up get it out of
there and you will have a better product
[SPEAKER_00]: So use your thumbs or some scissors to
gently remove the excess leaves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: little stems from the buds get rid of the
handlebars Get rid of the crow's feet now
[SPEAKER_00]: once the buds are trimmed to your
satisfaction You can place them into a
[SPEAKER_00]: container for finished products Now when I
say to your satisfaction how you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: trim your buds is up to you If you want to
leave it a little fluffy go for it You
[SPEAKER_00]: want to trim it nice and tight go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you If your product is for
you personally then you can leave it as
[SPEAKER_00]: leafy as you want You can knock those
leaves off right before you smoke it You
[SPEAKER_00]: can clean it up yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on getting top dollar for your
product You'll need to have a tight clean
[SPEAKER_00]: trim job One thing I should mention that
will help us speed up the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming is the rule of thumb If the bud
you are trimming is not bigger than the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip of your thumb It's probably better to
let that bud go to your hash pile and trim
[SPEAKER_00]: something more Substantial put those
little popcorn buds in the hash pile put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in your trim pile and you can make
better hash that will improve the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of your concentrate so if it's a little
tiny bud don't waste time trimming it just
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it in the hash pile and don't waste
your time trimming little tiny buds if you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like that little tiny bud is worth
less money than the time it is taking you
[SPEAKER_00]: to trim it set it aside and put it in the
hash pile you don't have to trim that if
[SPEAKER_00]: herb costs $10 a gram and It takes you
like a minute to trim that little nug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So toss that little nug into the trim bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll add that to the concentration grab
something that we can trim and get on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf and make it purchasable for the
consumer So if it's real tiny if it's ugly
[SPEAKER_00]: don't bother trimming it You can put that
in your hash pile You can add that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: to be extracted pile and that will just
improve your concentrates It will also
[SPEAKER_00]: speed you up Of course if you need every
little half gram every piece of gravel out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that crop to make your goal to make
your weight Go ahead and trim that up add
[SPEAKER_00]: that that'll be weight in the bottom of
the bag But if it's not necessary if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just for you put that In the concentrate
pile and speed yourself up in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow The growers are expected to kick out
a pound minimum per person per shift Some
[SPEAKER_00]: people turn in two pounds every day and if
they spend time trimming that little
[SPEAKER_00]: gravel shit, they would never get there we
have a way of separating all those little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny buds all that little stuff gets
filtered out it gets pushed to the side
[SPEAKER_00]: and Then all of that those little buds and
the trim they're combined and it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into concentrates So do a nice
tight trim if you want to sell it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't go overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't trim it too tight And also don't try
trimming all those little buds or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna put yourself in debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay your trimmers You're
spending your time make it cost effective
[SPEAKER_00]: now something I want to mention trimming
will be very strain dependent Some buds
[SPEAKER_00]: are tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buds are real fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buds are a little compacted little
rocks You can just kind of rub your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers over those and those are gonna
trim Some buds are airy and have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: texture to them Those are gonna be a
little harder to trim because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to knock off all those calyxes You're
going to have to adjust also if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working for somebody else you're going to
have to adjust to how they want it trimmed
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to a grow and you're working
for someone else they get to dictate how
[SPEAKER_00]: tight your trim is don't over trim don't
under trim you trim to their expectation
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not sure what they want have
them trim up a bud and show you have them
[SPEAKER_00]: trim up two or three buds and set those at
your workstation so you have something to
[SPEAKER_00]: refer to as the day goes on so that you
don't forget and also if they come by and
[SPEAKER_00]: say hey why you doing it like that you got
a couple little buds to show them you
[SPEAKER_00]: could say hey these are what you showed me
this is what I did show me the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: show me where I'm going wrong then they
can say fuck you're doing it just like I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you I'm sorry so we got a nice
tight trim we're setting the trim in one
[SPEAKER_00]: pile we're setting our little tiny buds in
another pile we're mixing that up so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can make good concentrates out of it we
were getting rid of all the sticks you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys I think we have covered most of
trimming one great thing about trimming is
[SPEAKER_00]: scissor and glove hash all that sticky
shit that builds up on your gloves and
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors is smokable you can smoke that
right away Mike loves scissor hash what I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do if I've got if I've been
trimming so say you've been trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got this weird layer of like sticky
gooey looking shit all over your gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: that's resin that's trichomes that is
potency rub your hands together and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start figuring out how to rub your hands
in a circle to make that stuff stick
[SPEAKER_00]: together a little bit of heat goes a long
way so if your hands get warm it'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: taking that resin right off of your hands
I don't want to smoke it off your skin
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day we used to call it finger
hash but please wear gloves now and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna call it glove hash you can scrape it
off your scissors you can smoke it off
[SPEAKER_00]: your gloves then put it in a bowl you can
put it on top of some pot or just put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in an empty bowl and just put a flame to
it and melt it just slowly melt that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: until it starts smoking and you can smoke
that scissor hash that glove hash you can
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it right away but please don't pass
that shit to me if you did that off your
[SPEAKER_00]: skin and weren't wearing gloves I don't
want to smoke your skin so that's one good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about trimming is you get scissor
hash right away I think that anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks to your gloves that's yours you get
to smoke that if you come trim for me and
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit sticks to your gloves I have no
problem with you rolling that right off
[SPEAKER_00]: your glove put that in a pipe and smoke it
right in front of me you earned that that
[SPEAKER_00]: is your scissor hash that means you're
trimming your ass off if it's on your
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors scrape your scissors off smoke
that shit what a lot of people will do all
[SPEAKER_00]: the trimmers in the room will just gather
all their scissor hash into one pile and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into a big ball and then at the end
of the day you guys all smoke that
[SPEAKER_00]: together it's like a little celebration
but it's smokable that's my point you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make edibles out of it if you want to but
I would recommend smoking it Mike loves
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it it's not my favorite to smoke
it's a little it's heavy on the lungs and
[SPEAKER_00]: it tastes kind of wet but it is potent and
it will give you a big fat hit another
[SPEAKER_00]: great thing about dry trimming that I
didn't mention is that when you are done
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming you can now weigh your product
you've been cutting off the extra crap and
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing that in one pile then you've been
throwing those finished buds into one pile
[SPEAKER_00]: all you got to do is set that container on
the scale and weigh it now one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend is a good idea whatever
container you're going to throw your buds
[SPEAKER_00]: into your finished buds if it's gonna be a
bucket if it's gonna be a Tupperware
[SPEAKER_00]: container weigh that and write the weight
of that on your container so that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done trimming into that container
you know how much that weighs so just
[SPEAKER_00]: subtract the weight of your container and
now you know how much product is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: scale so it's always rewarding knowing how
much product you've got right at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the trim process when you wet trim you
don't know because you've got to wait for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to dry still so when people say how
much did you trim today and they said I
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed a wet pound how do you know bro it
was wet it's got to dry we'll find out in
[SPEAKER_00]: a few days so if you're paying people to
trim by the pound dry trim is the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go because now you've got dry pounds to
weigh you don't have a wet pound to guess
[SPEAKER_00]: on the weight so here's one more thing I
should definitely mention to all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends who have never trimmed before
everybody who is new with cannabis here's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I have to tell you when you
were trimming or working with plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: general do not touch your eyes with sticky
trim fingers don't rub your eye with the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of your hand go wash your hands
before you touch your eyes if you rub your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes with trichomes or plant resin on your
finger it is going to burn for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: hour and it is sticky and every time you
blink most of the time you think you can
[SPEAKER_00]: blink and it'll fix your sticky eye or
whatever is in your eye not when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: resin in your eye every time you blink it
gets fucking stickier and it feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: your eyelid is sticking to your eyeball
and it just burns so wear gloves and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to itch your eye take your
fucking glove off your hand then itch your
[SPEAKER_00]: eye I would almost consider washing my
hands before the itch take the glove off
[SPEAKER_00]: go wash the hand then scratch the eye but
I understand sometimes you just got to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick your finger in your eye because
shit's going weird take that glove off you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys don't put plant resin or trichomes in
your eye it will fucking suck that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: technical term for it it fucking sucks
there's no other way to describe it it
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking sucks you guys all right so I feel
like I've given you a pretty good lesson
[SPEAKER_00]: on trimming I know I didn't teach you
exactly how to trim the act of holding the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud and putting the scissors to it is
something you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience you will develop your technique
and your style I feel like I've given you
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty good outline you know what to do
with the product you know how to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: there you just need some practice doing it
get some buds and put some scissors to
[SPEAKER_00]: them that's the only way you're gonna get
good at it it's the only way you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get faster at it when we hire new trimmers
at the grow we don't always hire the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that claim to be the fastest
trimmers we hire the people that interview
[SPEAKER_00]: well and seem like they're gonna fit in
with the crew if they say they can only
[SPEAKER_00]: trim a half a pound of weed when they
start that is fine if that is real if they
[SPEAKER_00]: say they can trim a half a pound and they
only do a quarter pound then I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: issues but they say I can trim a half a
pound in a day I'm fine with that we will
[SPEAKER_00]: train them we will teach them our system
we'll teach them some tricks they'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: in they'll get a rhythm they'll get a
routine and eventually they'll be trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: a pound in a half a day so it's all about
just finding the rhythm it's all about
[SPEAKER_00]: finding the groove and it takes you a
little bit of time and experience to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and do it also these are buds
these are precious to people I've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry for a long time I can grab a
flowering plant that's a few days in and
[SPEAKER_00]: just cut that fucker down and feel no
remorse or anything if that's what needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen in a commercial grow I kill the
plant a lot of people treat little buds
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're the most precious thing
they've ever seen which I respect you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get to grow a bunch of plants I have
produced over a ton of cannabis in my life
[SPEAKER_00]: I am responsible for a ton of cannabis but
having been produced a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have that under their belt so every bud is
precious to them they don't want to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: up one single bud I get that so when
they're new at it they go really slow
[SPEAKER_00]: especially a hired trimmer that is not
their product that is your bud that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're playing with respect them for
taking their time and going slow with it
[SPEAKER_00]: but also encourage them to go faster you
have to learn and go faster but people
[SPEAKER_00]: like to go slow in the beginning because
they're playing with gold they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: they're playing with a little pieces of
gold they got little babies in their hand
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're new so they're kind of
intimidated so keep that in mind you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get faster as time goes on is what I'm
trying to say you guys you just need some
[SPEAKER_00]: practice you'll become a good trimmer if
you want to become a good trimmer and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to get your foot in the door in
the commercial marijuana industry being a
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmer is probably the number one way to
get in the door trimmers and bud tenders
[SPEAKER_00]: are how you get started so trimming can be
really time-consuming and tedious but it
[SPEAKER_00]: is the last step before you claim victory
in your garden if your garden is for sale
[SPEAKER_00]: you're one step away from money if your
garden is for medicinal uses you're one
[SPEAKER_00]: step away from feeling better so trimming
sucks but you're almost there it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardest most time-consuming tedious
part in my opinion it is my least favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: part but it is one step away from sweet
success alright podcast world I hope this
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming lesson made sense again the only
way to get good at trimming is to get
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky and get some practice get in there
get your gloves dirty get your scissors
[SPEAKER_00]: all sticky and start trimming up some weed
if you want to learn and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that are harvesting volunteer to
trim for free everybody could use a free
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmer and we know we're gonna have to
teach you that's fine but we hope that in
[SPEAKER_00]: a few harvests you're gonna show up and
you're gonna trim your ass off like a
[SPEAKER_00]: savage so there are people that will help
you learn by letting you trim for free if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get those opportunities please do take
