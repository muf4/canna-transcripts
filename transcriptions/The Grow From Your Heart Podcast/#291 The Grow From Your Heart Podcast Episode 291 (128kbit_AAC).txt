[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 291 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, you're a new smoker
[SPEAKER_00]: or a dedicated dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cannabis activist or even
someone who's just curious about the
[SPEAKER_00]: current state of cannabis, this,
my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots fan for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the
podcast is brought to you by our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Hela Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to add new seeds to your
garden, I recommend the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start these episodes off by
talking about what I've been smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I've been dabbing the Sour Clems
from Apothecary Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran the Sour Diesel and the
Clementine together and they made a batter
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it and it looks and smells and
tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the head high has been perfect lately
for what I've been trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you could smell this through the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm opening it up and I'm waving it at the
microphone just for you and you can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little hint of Sour Diesel in
the bottom, but then it's got this candy
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine turp at the top that is just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combo is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been working very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well for what I need done in the past
few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually pay for all the concentrates
that I buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just enjoy it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I just took a half gram dab of
Shatter from Concentrate Supply Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some lemon medicine that I picked
up at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mouth tastes like a watermelon and a
lemon and another tropical fruit and I
[SPEAKER_00]: approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me a little more lit than I needed
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a podcast, but I'm sure I'll be able
to shake that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some great stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to brag for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday and Sunday, I got to go see Doug
Benson at the Comedy Works in downtown
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy Works is one of the two best comedy
clubs on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Comedy Works in Denver and then
there's the Comedy Store in LA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where Joe Rogan and Joey Diaz and
Chris D'Elia and all those guys hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: and gals there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gals are to Ali Wong and Eliza's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys and gals there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all hang out, but the Comedy Works is
what we've got and it's just two hours
[SPEAKER_00]: away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 120 miles and I love the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat me like royalty because I've
developed a relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made friends with a bunch of the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, Doug Benson was there for Saturday
and Sunday shows and I got to go see the
[SPEAKER_00]: shows and hang out with Doug and a couple
of his friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday, Doug did a standup comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug likes to start his standup comedy
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually there's an opener or an MC even
and an MC will come out and talk for about
[SPEAKER_00]: five or 10 minutes and get the crowd
loosened up and then they will introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the opener.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be maybe MC opener or just opener
and then a feature act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have a local guy usually,
like some guy that you could barely
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerate for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll give him seven minutes of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll go out and then he'll pass the mic
to the feature act and the feature will do
[SPEAKER_00]: like 20, 30 minutes and then he will bring
out the headliner or he will pass the mic
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the MC and then he'll bring out
the headliner and the headliner will come
[SPEAKER_00]: out and everyone will cheer and then he'll
do his probably an hour, 45 to an hour and
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, just depends on who it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was Ralphie May, Ralphie May used to
do fucking three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chappelle will go on all fucking night if
you let him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the guys do 45 to an hour,
hour and 15 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, Doug Benson likes to come out and
start the show himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He walks right out on stage and he starts
doing comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he likes to get into tweets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson will read his tweets on stage,
but it's funny because people like myself
[SPEAKER_00]: that know he's going to read those tweets
will tweet him funny shit right before the
[SPEAKER_00]: show or just tweet him something before
the show so that he will read it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on stage and everybody gets a good
laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that kind of kills that at
ComedyWorks, when you walk in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they ask you to put your phone in these
little, it looks like a body glove wetsuit
[SPEAKER_00]: for your phone is honestly what it makes
me think of and it's got the, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing at the mall they put on the jeans so
you can't steal them and then they got to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it on that little machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes pop and then it opens it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put, it's got that kind of enclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your phone is in a little body glove
wetsuit with a little magnetized enclosure
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't access your phone during the
comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people hate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there to watch people play on
their phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there to play on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be distracted by my phone,
somebody else's phone, any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pay attention to the comedy show
and the comedians appreciate it because
[SPEAKER_00]: they deliver a better show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that kind of messes up Doug Benson's
little game where you can tweet him while
[SPEAKER_00]: he's on stage and he'll read your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did read my tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug, of course I've seen Doug Benson a
lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me how many times, from the stage
he asked me how many times I've seen him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him at least 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was closer to 17 or 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said about 15 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made fun of me for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a lot of edibles and I tweeted him
about that and he made fun of me for
[SPEAKER_00]: eating so many edibles and asked me what I
ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about that from the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was yelling at me from the stage to the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Doug came out and opened the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he brought out his friend and my
friend, also another comedian named Trey
[SPEAKER_00]: Galleon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey came and did, I think he did about 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Trey did 30 and then passed the
mic back over to Doug and Doug came out
[SPEAKER_00]: and did about 15 or 20 minutes of comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they played a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Sunday, they were doing the Doug Loves
Movies podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug has four or five podcasts and Doug
Loves Movies was being recorded on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play movie trivia games on the Doug
Loves Movies podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the comedy show,
people who brought name tags that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the Doug Loves Movies podcast,
you can bring, you make a name tag that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a spoof of a movie and you put
your name in the movie title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine has been Rasta Jeff Strikes Back,
just cause that's pretty awesome,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But people that took their name tags on
Saturday were invited to come up on stage
[SPEAKER_00]: and play a game with Doug and Trey and
other audience members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the winner of that game got to be a
full guest on the Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to jump right to it guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have known about that all
fucking ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to be a guest, but I really,
really wanted to, but I did get to get up
[SPEAKER_00]: on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get to play the games with Doug and
Trey and other contestants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The game is called, is it Last Man Stanton
or is that the Leonard Malton game?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Last Man Stanton.
[SPEAKER_00]: The audience picks an actor or an actress
and they picked Morgan Freeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just go down the line naming
Morgan Freeman movies until you run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's your turn and you don't have a
Morgan Freeman movie, you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got through one round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, there were like
seven or eight people on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of goddamn Morgan Freeman
movies that were listed off before it got
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably, that means like 14 of
them got listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was, I don't know, it was about 10,
they got listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said the two that I knew and then it
was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it came to me, I just politely
said, I ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I walked off stage, but I got to
be on the stage with Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Trey Galleon and with like seven or
eight other contestants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kellan who won.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no, no hard feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cool to see that guy up there
playing cause he was a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just an average Joe from Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like he was having the time
of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get spoiled quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't even feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to sit front row for the podcast
recording for the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson asks that I don't sit front
row where we've become friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says it's distracting to have
friends in the front row because he just
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to do his comedy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's done it before he stood in front
of me and just done full bits and then
[SPEAKER_00]: walked away like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking to Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he asked me not to sit directly in
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have these other VIP seats at
ComedyWorks where I sit for the comedy,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the standup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he does the podcast,
he doesn't mind me upfront cause there's
[SPEAKER_00]: so much going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the comedy show is Doug opening,
then Trey did a set, then Doug did a set,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they did the game show and I got
eliminated and a guy named Kellan won and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day was the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug is the host and he brings three
guests on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already told you that one of the guests
was the guy that won the night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name was Kellan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Kellan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen, I don't know if you ever
will.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an odd random coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two guests were Trey Galleon,
obviously because he traveled with Doug
[SPEAKER_00]: from the night before and Todd Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
comedian Todd Glass, but he is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a rumor that he had had a
really rough night on stage the night
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was curious to see how Todd was
going to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really freaking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting directly in front of Todd
Glass for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I laughed until my stomach hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first night Doug did stand up,
Trey, we talked about the first night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second night was the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings everybody out right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give away prizes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do game shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one point when an audience
member started yelling at Trey Galleon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He yelled, fuck you, Trey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what brought it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a lot of edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys ate 300 milligrams of edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate 200 milligrams of first night and
300 the second night just to try to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that dude just started yelling,
fuck you, Trey, I don't know where that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, why is somebody yelling,
fuck you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Trey yelled, fuck you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got intense for a couple of minutes
and everyone started laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I looked at the back of the crowd
like, who's yelling, fuck you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Doug Benson grabbed his mic and he
goes, oh shit, Rasta Jeff looks concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really made everybody laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that dude thought he was
going to run toward the stage or what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Trey's my friend and I was in the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, you're not going to make it
to Trey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stand up and block if I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't trying or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just funny the way Doug Benson
was like, oh shit, Rasta Jeff looks
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to know who was yelling,
fuck you at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fuck you is the last thing you want to
hear at a comedy show unless it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: punchline or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to balance out the fuck you,
Todd Glass, who was hilarious all night,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to keep mentioning how hilarious
Todd Glass was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept having weird chants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would chant stuff like kitty,
kitty, woof, woof, let's get along,
[SPEAKER_00]: meow, meow, kitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just weird, random.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when things would get weird or if
he would tell a joke that didn't work,
[SPEAKER_00]: he would just say, meow, meow,
woof, woof, let's get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody would chant it back at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was stupid the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after like the seventh time,
you had no choice except to chant it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meow, meow, woof, woof, let's get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meow, meow, woof, woof, let's get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two times, it sounds really
stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept doing it and I fell for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson, Trey Galleon, Todd Glass,
and a guy named Kellan from Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great podcast recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you go listen to Doug Loves
Movies and listen to the Denver episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I ran into the Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped at Apothecary Extracts on my way
to Denver to get some high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess who was in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The beautiful, lovely Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in there stocking up for the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kidnapped her and we went for a short
little drive and had a nice conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: and shared our freshly purchased condoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny, if you're listening to this
podcast, thank you for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we were both able to press pause
on our day and go spend a minute together
[SPEAKER_00]: and just talk about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of felt like you needed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stories we got to share were perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Granny, I love you every day and I
hope to get you on the podcast again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if there's no microphones or
anything, let's get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I owe a huge shout out to my friend,
Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker, I don't know if you listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you do occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a religious thing,
but dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you every day, Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I want to give a huge shout out
to all of my friends at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in Denver, if you're anywhere
in Colorado and you want to go see an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing show, go to the ComedyWorks
webpage, see a comedian that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with, find a night that they're
performing and buy tickets and go to that
[SPEAKER_00]: and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will laugh your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never been to a comedy show,
it's an experience everybody should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple of heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get there a little bit early because
parking kind of sucks in downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Park in the Rider Square parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks will give you a parking
validation that makes your parking $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty damn cheap for Denver
parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So park in Rider Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get there about an hour before
showtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doors will open about an hour before
showtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get there an hour, hour and a half
before showtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not cold, go stand outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just hanging out on 15th Street in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So park at Rider Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get there a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go stand in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your ID ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get downstairs to the showroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get seated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a couple of drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be upset how close you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you're going to say is,
God damn, these seats are fucking close
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy needs to get trapped in that
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the ceiling is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the seats are tight together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy works better when everybody's
compacted like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You share comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy, comedy, it expands.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it hits another person and travels
backward, it expands a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why ComedyWorks is tight like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, don't heckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the lights go off and the comedian
comes out and that mic's in his hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is your job to shut the fuck up and
listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please just listen to the comedy show and
laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncross your arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your arms are crossed, uncross them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just don't talk shit to the comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the wait staff at ComedyWorks is
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The service crew at ComedyWorks is
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please tip your wait staff at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work their asses off and I love each
and every one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have that much fun there where I
feel like I should say that about
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage everybody to go check out a
comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the ComedyWorks website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll through and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just scroll through the calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: See who's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see a comedian that you're
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there are two locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the downtown location much better
than the south location.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wendy, thank you for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks takes amazing care of me and
your staff is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's enough
bragging about my amazing weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Instagram live earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where I was taking my half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go hang out on Instagram live
and answer cannabis grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about random shit and I get high
as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Instagram, I'm iRee underscore
genetics and I was doing an Instagram live
[SPEAKER_00]: video and somebody asked me if I had any
tips for a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first tip of course was,
yeah, listen to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pitched the show at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my second tip was go buy and read a
well-written cannabis book from a
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known grower and or cannabis author,
somebody like Ed Rosenthal, Jorge
[SPEAKER_00]: Cervantes, Drew West, Greg Green,
somebody in that realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy a cannabis book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody out there is thinking about
starting a cannabis grow, before you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: any seeds, before you buy a clone,
before you buy a grow light, before you
[SPEAKER_00]: pick which room you're going to grow in,
the first thing you should do is go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon and order one or two grow books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for them to come in the mail and then
crack them open and read them cover to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover so that when you get your seeds or
your clones, you know what kind of light
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what kind of ventilation you're
going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research before you buy the seeds,
before you buy the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're going to have a puppy,
you should probably go get a puppy food
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get a leash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have all the requirements for a
puppy before you bring the puppy home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring the puppy home and
then throughout the day go, shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a dog bowl and then have to drive
to the dog bowl store and get a dog bowl
[SPEAKER_00]: and then realize later, should I need a
leash and have to go, you should have all
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic necessities figured out before
you get a puppy and I feel the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: about before you get plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a new grower, my first advice would
be to get cannabis books and read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what to expect about cannabis so that
when you're growing and a problem pops up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to get on some sort of
social media and message me immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: and go, hey Rasta Jeff, what's going wrong
with my plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me, help me, help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look into your book and you can
go, oh, I read about this a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago when I was pooping and this is
probably a phosphorus deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is probably this and then you can
figure it out because you've already read
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead and there's no need to panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a new grower, my first advice would
be get some books and then another piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of advice and I've said this before on the
show, there's no magic bullet when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every small piece of the puzzle adds up to
the quality of product you have in the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got good lights, if you've got
good air, if you've got good water,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got good soil, if you've got
good nutrients, if you bottomed and pruned
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants and popped the stems well and
took care, if you've got good genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you took care of everything the way you
needed to, your plants will reach their
[SPEAKER_00]: full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't do everything that needs
to be done, those plants are going to lack
[SPEAKER_00]: in some area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of pieces of the puzzle to
put together and for each piece of that
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzle that you're missing, the completed
picture starts to look worse, the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about having each piece of
that puzzle in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about having the correct lighting,
having the light, the right height,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right spectrum, having the right
genetics, using the right soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: using the right amount of perlite in your
soil, feeding the right time, the right
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about adding everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no magic bullet for growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can buy just to
simplify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no machine you can put your plant
in that will grow it and grow the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to build a proper grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to give it love and you just have
to maintain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of maintaining your cannabis
plants is being there and seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing because you can't time
things properly if you don't learn the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be there and pay attention
and learn the timing of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have to know when to do
things ahead of time so that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand how to identify
pests and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of pieces of a puzzle that
go together to making the perfect grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's surprising how quickly when one
piece of that puzzle falls apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the whole pyramid just starts
crumbling because you see a problem here
[SPEAKER_00]: and that causes a problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a grower freaks out and wants to
correct it and causes two more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to get all your pieces dialed
in and then you can get your crop to its
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I feel like I've been rambling
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink and I'll be
right back and we will read some listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: World, I am back and I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got an email from a listener who
they did not state if they want me to say
[SPEAKER_00]: their name or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will skip that part, but the subject
is help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to start by saying you have by
far the best educational cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I am reaching out though is because I
am having a major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would consider myself a very experienced
grower with over 10 years of growing under
[SPEAKER_00]: my belt from gorilla outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light depth greenhouses and warehouse
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a custom salt mix using house and
garden for my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for additives, I use liquid cool
bloom, bud candy, flora malicious plus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Excel and magnesium, no PGRs and no
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pH at 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be a little low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd raise that to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use pro mix peat moss for my medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavita lights temps at 77 during the day
and 67 at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little higher, but sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity at 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep getting large amounts of seeds in
my entire indoor grow with no males or
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not strain specific and has not
and has to be something with my feed
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen, but it is horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Northern California and recently
quit my day job to start as a lead grower
[SPEAKER_00]: at a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be starting business in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be life changing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am donating to your podcast as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am by donating, he is talking about my
Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in contributing,
you can go to patreon.com slash grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart and you can make a
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the contribution over
there on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things here that get
my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I would raise the pH of your
feed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you pH at 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go to 6.3, maybe 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make more nutrients available to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm getting large amounts of seeds in
my entire indoor grow with no males or
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is coming from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is either coming from in the room or
outside of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you exposed to other crops that may
have a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you exposed to hemp crops that may
have a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going anywhere that there may be
male pollen around at any course of your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you bringing pollen in?
[SPEAKER_00]: But most likely, this pollen is coming
from inside of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds aren't happening without pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would assume that this is an inside
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You listed off a lot of nutrients and you
may be overfeeding with all of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be doubling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving it Cool Bloom, Bud Candy,
Floralicious Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are all basically the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with those products and
the Bud XL.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may all be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be overfeeding a little bit,
which may be stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certain on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say no PGRs, no pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH you mentioned, that's too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think you've got your nutrients
dialed in, if you don't feel that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem, my first guess on this would
be a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a light problem,
but that would slow your growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate somewhere that there was a
problem and you would probably see
[SPEAKER_00]: nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would assume there's a light leak
somewhere was probably the, when I emailed
[SPEAKER_00]: you, I think my first guess was light
leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I would do to diagnose the
light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go into the room, go into the room
when it is sunlight outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in a basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in the attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you've got going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into the grow when there is sunshine
outside and turn off all of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off every light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave all of your equipment on and just
sit in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit still for like five to 10 minutes and
let your eyes adjust and start looking
[SPEAKER_00]: around in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you have ducted lights with
the ducting coming from outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: the light will travel through the ducting
right into your reflector and it'll look
[SPEAKER_00]: just like lights coming through your light
reflector with no bulb turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the sunshine coming down your
ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a piece of equipment in
there that's got a colored light on that
[SPEAKER_00]: is disrupting your plant sleep cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and turn off all the lights
and just wait a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can see your hand in front of
your face, there's too much light in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's light coming from the crack
under the door, if there is any light,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only light that is acceptable would be
a green LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've got an indicator light on
your CO2 or if you've got a green
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator light on any of your equipment,
green is the only acceptable light at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a green LED would be the only thing you
can approve of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got other light, you have to
stop that light from coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero light means zero light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want absolute total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be able to see your hand
in front of your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to accidentally bump your fingers
on your nose when you reach for your face
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can't see your own hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how dark you need it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got any light in there,
it is causing a problem and the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: is getting the light, if it's a keyhole,
if the light is coming in through the
[SPEAKER_00]: keyhole, if the light is coming in through
a crack, the plant right there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting hit, that bud is going to herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suspect you've either got a
light leak which is causing a herm or
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a plant which is a herm itself
and it's just herming out and throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and you have not spotted the
banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you've got a big bud,
the bananas can be in the middle just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got, imagine you've got a
stick and then the buds are growing up the
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of the stick, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The banana doesn't have to grow on the
outside of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That banana could have grown on the inside
of the bud and by banana you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, by banana I'm saying male
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean a male flower that pops up out of a
female plant to indicate hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes one single male banana,
male flower will pop out of a bud if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed or if it's got a light leak and
this guy's pH is off and he's feeding a
[SPEAKER_00]: little heavy and I suspect there's a light
leak somewhere but we're going to send him
[SPEAKER_00]: in there in the dark to check on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go do that soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: One banana will pop up and it may be right
up against the stick, not on the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bud but on the inside and that
pollen just takes a little bit of wind or
[SPEAKER_00]: you just tap in the plant this hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you got to tap it and pollen
will trickle out and fly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be surprised at how little pollen
it takes to seed an entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One small branch of a hermaphroditic plant
with like a few hermaphrodite flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: could decimate an entire 10 by 10 grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: A four light, a six light, a nine light
you could ruin it with one tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could lightly seed an entire 16 by 16
grow room with one medium sized male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could lightly seed every female in
that room if you timed it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one of those plants has a
hermaphrodite flower in there it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing up and if you're not noticing it
it just keeps going and the fan hits the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and just spreads it all throughout
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you've either got a light leak
or there's a plant that's getting overfed
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's becoming a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are two ways to find out if
these are causes of your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go in there and make sure
you've got total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy to do, that is a quick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing you can do is adjust
your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would research and find a brand of
nutrients that you like and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go print out the nutrient
calculator off of that brand's website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to tell you on week one a
flower use this much of this bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: this much of this bottle, this much of
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Print that out for an entire flower cycle
and use that fairly close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe use it at 50 or 75% of what the
recommended dosage is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do decide to reduce it,
reduce everything equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go 50% reduce every
bottle 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go 75% go 75 with every
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pick a brand and then buy the lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get everything that you can and
then feed it what it's recommended or just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit lighter and do everything
else the same and see if you have seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take a whole crop but that
way you'll find out if it's your feed and
[SPEAKER_00]: also pH it to 63 to 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get somewhere closer to 63 or 60 is too
low in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your plants will respond better if
you brought the pH of your feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: solution up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suspect you've got a hermaphrodite in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect it's probably caused by a light
leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you go in there and
check out the light leak and then get back
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if I am right or if I am wrong
and then I will follow up with you and we
[SPEAKER_00]: will read your response and my reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey I want to thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want me to say your
name or not so if we interact again please
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know if you want your name said on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way thank you for the great email
and let's get this figured out because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got to be frustrating growing a bunch
of seeds when you're not trying to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys if you want to send me an email
the email address is growfromyourheart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to answer your grow related
question or your cannabis related question
[SPEAKER_00]: on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got time for one more email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says preface.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you get slammed with emails like
this but I have to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of missed opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for reading and I hope to get a
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey I like your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you reached out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fail if you don't try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes like this and says Hey
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently discovered your podcast and I
love it man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to ask some advice from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heavy heavily interested in getting
into growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to learn from people that will
instill great practices in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently heard an episode where you
spoke about preferring to work with people
[SPEAKER_00]: that will follow directions exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the grows I want to be a
part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to eventually be a master grower
someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly a goal you can reach
with the mindset like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes enough rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any sort of advice you can give
about reputable channels I can go through
[SPEAKER_00]: to get hooked up with someone legit having
absolutely no experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to go into a legit grow so
that I don't get gunked up with bad
[SPEAKER_00]: habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any and all advice is welcome and much
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bless up and stay iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signed his real name but I
don't know if he wants me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you asked this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of things to say about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off you're probably going to have to
start somewhere as a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety percent of the grows in this state
hire staff as trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody starts as a trimmer because
that's where you show if you can show up
[SPEAKER_00]: on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you show if you can follow
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we learn if you're tolerable
as a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get along with the rest of our
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting you as a trimmer just gets you in
the door and we need people to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always need people to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get you trimming and then we learn you
and we figure out where else you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid and don't feel like you
are selling yourself short by starting as
[SPEAKER_00]: a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off as a trimmer and trim your ass
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by this message that you are
going to be one of those trimmers that
[SPEAKER_00]: stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always a couple of trimmers that
you know on their first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's time to clean up grab a broom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be one of the guys that somebody has
to give you a broom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the guy that went got two brooms and
handed the broom to the guy that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a guy that doesn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a guy that does extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the guy that does extra and pass the
second room to the guy that doesn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the guy that gets shit started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the guy that gets shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that you want to learn from
people that will instill great practices
[SPEAKER_00]: in you and you want to work with people
that follow directions exactly and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be in those styles of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately you are walking into
someone's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do it their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do is do it their way to the
best of your ability and do exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: they ask for the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's going to drive you crazy
not being able to do things your way but
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately in this industry that's how
it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to suck up your
pride a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say reputable channels you
can go through to get hooked up with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't have any recommendations of
facilities you could go to and apply or
[SPEAKER_00]: hiring services I would recommend where
you can go and they'll find you a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to recommend is that you
apply your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create an impressive resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sell yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever skills you've got list them on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't oversell yourself and don't lie
because if you tell me you can trim two
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds a day and I hire you and you trim a
pound a day I'll fire you quickly because
[SPEAKER_00]: you set expectations you cannot meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tell me you can only trim three
quarters of a pound a day and I hire you
[SPEAKER_00]: and you trim three quarters to a pound a
day I'll be ecstatic because you met the
[SPEAKER_00]: goal you set for yourself and we can
improve on you from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't reach the goal you bragged
about I'm not going to keep you around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow design a fancy impressive resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't embellish it but create a resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself in the door somewhere then
work your ass off and with your money
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset and with the way you think and
with the letter that you sent me I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell that you're not going to be a trimmer
for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be the next step really quickly
then whatever is next in line you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you will be the black belt of
whatever facility you go to before no
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't like the facility where
you where you land in the first jump go
[SPEAKER_00]: apply at more facilities while you're off
on your day at work five days a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: bust your ass and then on the sixth day
get up and go apply at as many grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go apply everywhere until you can find a
facility that you like and then take over
[SPEAKER_00]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with the mindset that you've got
you're not going to be stuck with an entry
[SPEAKER_00]: level position for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you've got a strong mind that
you want to move forward and bosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: owners, managers we see that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start where you can get in there kick
ass and then slowly work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly I started off at I'm the lead
cultivator for Three Rivers and I started
[SPEAKER_00]: off there as a grow tech I was hired on as
grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had ended my career with another grow a
while back and I was taking some time and
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that they were advertising and I was
like it'd be fun just to go dick around in
[SPEAKER_00]: a grow and they hired me and then I
noticed that I was the diplomatic way to
[SPEAKER_00]: say it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably more experienced in a grow
than they're the current lead grower they
[SPEAKER_00]: had in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And slowly I proved myself and I took over
the position as lead cultivator and now I
[SPEAKER_00]: run that facility and the new facility
that they've opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started at the bottom of the totem
pole and I climbed my way to the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: now I am management and I'm in the
management meetings and I've got I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there are 15 people that I'm pretty much
responsible for all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah start start where you can and work
your way up that's that's one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest pieces of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I said that I didn't have
recommendations for places to go but there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a few places that I do like and I know
that they do things the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I would recommend is the
House of Dankness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare Dankness with Scott Reach they do
things well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Cut Above does things very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind Love does things very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just three I like to do things
in groups of three so those are three that
[SPEAKER_00]: I may recommend that you check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's another thing I want to touch
on you said you have absolutely no
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a bad thing to a lot of
people but to myself I like that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: can hire you and I can train you to be the
grower that I need instead of the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: that you already are with bad habits and
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get an interview make sure you
let the person that interviews you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't have any experience but you
are eager to learn and you're eager to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to do it the way that it is done
in that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most frustrating things for me
as a person that hires people and that has
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with them it's so funny because
people in interviews are not the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: people that show up for the first day of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never the same person rarely maybe
two out of ten times you interview
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody and that person comes back for
work the first day it's it's really rare
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really frustrating to hire
somebody that you think is going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you in your grow and they spend the first
week of their employment teaching you what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing wrong in your grow when
they're running a small grow and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: no experience in the environment that they
are now in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super frustrating and it happens
often in a large facility so don't be that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy don't go in there trying to reinvent
the wheel go in there knowing how the
[SPEAKER_00]: wheel rolls and just trying to be part of
their wheel that's my biggest advice to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
