[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's work our way into the question
and answer portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, auto flower seeds have been a big
topic online on social media in the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of questions about
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually been getting a lot of
requests for auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking me to breed,
make and sell auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have asked me why I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we are going to briefly address
why I don't fuck with auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we do that, let's talk about what
are auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the seeds that I make, every seed
you buy from iRi Genetics, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed or a regular seed,
all of those seeds will be photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, which means they flower based on
the amount of light hours which they are
[SPEAKER_00]: given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are going to need 12 hours of
uninterrupted darkness per day to initiate
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a photo period plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The absence of light the short day,
that is what tells that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, it is time for me to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will initiate the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the plants that I make and I
enjoy growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the plants I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally do not enjoy growing or
smoking auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a hater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just trying to bash these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a plant that I can veg the amount
of time that I want to veg that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pop it, twist it, defoliate it,
lollipop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do all the manipulation that I need
to it to fill my canopy and grow the room
[SPEAKER_00]: to the quality and quantity that I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an auto flower plant, I don't have
that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are just going to flower when
they are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do as much manipulation because it
may stress that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the auto flowers can't be topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't dictate the amount of veg time
they are going to flower when they are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't prefer the auto flower plants,
mainly because I like, the first thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: like is the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be able to top the plant,
spread it out, veg it as long as I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill my space and flower when I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flower, I cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other aspect of an auto flower,
which I don't appreciate, is if I were to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the most amazing, fire, most potent,
tastiest, turpiest, best fucking plant I
[SPEAKER_00]: have ever grown with an auto flower,
that's a one-time deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to grow that again because
it's an auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not take a clone because you cannot
take clones from an auto flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone will be the same age as the
rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you've got a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a concept that counts to all
plants, but just think about this as auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a clone from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone is technically the same age as
the plant, which that clone came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came from a photo period or an auto
flower, that clone is the age of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that it derived from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plant's been growing for six
months, those hormones are moved around in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone is also six months old,
even if you just cut it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you cut that auto flower clone,
those hormones within that clone have
[SPEAKER_00]: already told that plant it is almost time
to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will go into flower before it roots
or very shortly after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have a little tiny auto flower
clone that just flowered on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't even get to keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main aspect is I like the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm a control freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've got some OCD, but I like to be
able to veg as long as I need to veg to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to be able to take a clone for
repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said we were going to talk about what
an auto flower is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I segued right on into telling you why I
don't make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that I cannot veg them as
long as I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot fill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot fill my canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot fill the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't fill the whole tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need to fill the whole space if I'm
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point in just filling a portion
of my grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use the space and fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of use the analogy of I am not a
country music fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like country music, enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a big fan of country music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can play it on the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it, but I'm not a big country
music fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love jam rock music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love rock and roll type music.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put me on the drums and you said
let's play reggae, that shit is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sound good because I've got reggae feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have researched and understood and felt
the feeling of reggae drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think it's a reggae drummer
playing on that track.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had me play country music,
it would sound good, but it wouldn't sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like it could if you hired a Nashville
Tennessee type of country drummer,
[SPEAKER_00]: a session studio country guy, to come in
and do that, it would be much better
[SPEAKER_00]: because he feels country.
[SPEAKER_00]: He understands that nuance of country
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, I don't like
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, now everything is concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could possibly give me some
concentrates made from auto flowers and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't know the difference because it's
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't know the difference right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, I don't enjoy
smoking or growing auto flower plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means I would not enjoy breeding
them because there's no passion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about breeding plants,
it's usually I'm in a grow and I see a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and I love the way that it grows and
I see it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watch it develop and I go that plant
right there, that's got something to it or
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell a jar or I smoke something or
something about one plant or two plants
[SPEAKER_00]: just tells me some bells, some buzzers go
off with auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get those buzzers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no there's no passion for the auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply do not get my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not attractive to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to compare that to music, to loop that
back around to music, that would be like
[SPEAKER_00]: me just playing country music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do it, but there would be no
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be no feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave the playing the country music
to people who enjoy the country music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come out better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly how I feel about the auto
flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let people with more passion grow
those auto flower plants, breed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of people out there doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Daz killing it with
the auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my company, the company motto is
grow from your heart and breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were breeding auto flower plants,
it would, it would not be love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you guys want them,
but I'm not in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would just be just Paul and Chuck
and it would, it would just be,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, it'd be a money grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what this is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has never been a money grab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has always been growing from my heart
and breeding with love, which is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a lot of why I am
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of why, why your favorite
musician is successful is because they put
[SPEAKER_00]: music out that they loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music came from their heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from their soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took them a long time to make that
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it out and it's fucking good
because they did what they love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't worried about, will you like
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope you guys like our product,
but if you don't, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I love my breeding project,
that's really what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as a musician loves the album that
they put out, that's really what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do something with passion
like that, and you're not worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: marketability, finances, sales,
numbers, charts, when you do something
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart, from your soul,
and this could be anything, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking, it could be sewing, whatever
you're into, whatever craft you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart, that will show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clientele is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it from your heart, don't do it
for clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clientele will buy your passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it with passion, if it's
painting, drawing, stitching, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you do, there's a million
different arts out there and I encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody to find your niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it with passion,
if you do it with love, and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust that art for the market,
you will find your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The audience will see that and you'll put
out a better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to adjust my breeding,
adjust my music for the audience,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make commercially
acceptable products or music.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about now how client or
artist or crowd influence comes into play
[SPEAKER_00]: with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your favorite musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that first album they made?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second album?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucked because they weren't struggling
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't struggling musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't sleeping on the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't living in the tour van.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were being handed a bunch of money
and then they were forced to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: product on a deadline and that wasn't done
with passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't record from their heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recorded because the fucking record
company has a deadline and we got to make
[SPEAKER_00]: this money and get these songs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell by that third,
that fourth album, all that passion went
[SPEAKER_00]: away because they forgot they're not
growing from their heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not breeding with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making auto flowers to fill a
contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never what this was about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off as a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started growing and then I got
into the medical marijuana field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw what I was doing for
medical marijuana patients and clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: it changed my outlook on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to sell black market cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was how I survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I got into the medical field,
the medical marijuana side of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I saw how a product that I took my
time to cultivate, I grew these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them, I harvested them,
trimmed them, dried them and cured them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had people come to my
dispensary and they would be brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be little old ladies that have
never smoked weed would come to this
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary looking for relief and they
wouldn't have any clue what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd give them three or four different
kinds of bud to say here's an indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a sativa, here's a hybrid,
and then here's just something else just
[SPEAKER_00]: to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would give them a gram of each or
pre-roll of each and I would label it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell them go home and smoke these
on a different day and figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: works the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a couple of rips, find out,
come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will work on your medical marijuana
needs and we'll get you dialed in
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little old lady that came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: She walked on one of the walkers like the
one that goes in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the tennis balls on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was hunched over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looked unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't feel happy when you spoke to
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She seemed in pain and miserable and
nearly desperate.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few weeks of coming to my
dispensary she was smoking a product that
[SPEAKER_00]: she had found helped her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her hunch went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her smile came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her overall health was improving and her
quality of life and her level of enjoyment
[SPEAKER_00]: of life was improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one person out of hundreds
of people I got to see at my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw that sort of stuff like people
coming in and the two or three minute
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction we would have just selling
them their medicine and the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations I could make and the plan
they were consuming was changing their
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was improving the quality of their life
and that changed my entire outlook,
[SPEAKER_00]: my approach, my everything to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would have asked me to make auto
flowers before that experience I might
[SPEAKER_00]: have done it because there's money there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have said, I'm missing a money
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's money on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make these autos and get that part
of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seeing those clients and those people
it sparked empathy and compassion and it
[SPEAKER_00]: changed my outlook and it changed my
approach to the entire plant, the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: business of cannabis, the entire passion
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed me as a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those interactions with those people at
that dispensary really changed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was never about a money grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was always maybe back in the day
before I got into the medical side when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing the black market thing,
that was for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the seed company, the breeding,
that has never been a money grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it was because I was very
frustrated with the seeds I was buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd spend good money on the website
overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to talk about their
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to praise them or bash them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were overpriced and a lot of the
seeds that I bought sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them came crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd spend whatever you veg for four weeks,
you flower for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking 13 weeks and then they would
not be satisfactory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of what got me breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a few things I did like and I
realized I can make seeds and I started
[SPEAKER_00]: making my own seeds because I wasn't
satisfied with what was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started seeing what the stuff I
was breeding was doing for people and that
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely inspired me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sparked me and pushed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, wow, that was a great ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever asked me about auto flowers
recently, it's been a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I owe you all a fist bump and a
big high five because you got me going on
[SPEAKER_00]: a very good ramble about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
this is going to be a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas is coming this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to get myself out and do some
Christmas shopping, get caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hang out and listen to podcasts all
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go spend some time with the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go spend some time with the loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go share some love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the greatest gift you can give
is just time and be there, be present,
[SPEAKER_00]: put your phone down, spend some time with
some people because unfortunately they
[SPEAKER_00]: won't all be here forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those people might not be here
next year, the year after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So love them while you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the people around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm freaking rambley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
listening to a quick episode.
