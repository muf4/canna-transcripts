[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back podcast world I'm your
host Rasta Jeff this of course is episode
[SPEAKER_01]: 853 of the grow from your heart podcast in
today's episode I'm going to give away
[SPEAKER_01]: free seeds hang out We'll talk more about
those free seeds later on in today's
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to send a quick update a quick
apology I did miss two uploads.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't usually miss uploads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did give you a warning I was going to
skip a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to skip two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a comedy festival In Las Vegas
every time I go to Fremont Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come back with the plague I can still
hear it in my headphones my voice my nose
[SPEAKER_01]: do not sound right I apologize if I sound
a little funky on this episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm trying to get an episode out Thank
you for all of the people who sent me well
[SPEAKER_01]: wishes and asked if I was okay No,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the Las Vegas plague It was not a
good time, but I'm recovering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm much better I am back on the mic and I
am excited to do a podcast episode Quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: just to talk about where I was I don't
like to talk too much about what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing on the podcast here Try to stick to
the topic But I went to a festival called
[SPEAKER_01]: skank fest many people many people may say
what was skank fest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting name Yes,
I listened to a podcast called the legion
[SPEAKER_01]: of skanks hosted by big Jay Okerson Lewis
Jay Gomez and Dave Smith.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great podcast They throw a comedy
festival every year that festival is
[SPEAKER_01]: called skank fest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing comedy festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting very big I've gone for the
past couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a really good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see a lot of great comedians I
got to see a lot of great podcasts
[SPEAKER_01]: recorded live I got to see a lot of great
friends that I know from skank fest that I
[SPEAKER_01]: only see at skank fest or comedy shows or
festivals So it's great to meet up with
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all there in one place Skank fest
is cool because a comedian will do a show
[SPEAKER_01]: on stage and you're in a big room packed
standing room only shoulder to shoulder
[SPEAKER_01]: with comedy fans skanks a bunch of skank
nerds a bunch of comedy nerds a bunch of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of crazy dudes having a good time
and then your favorite comic will tell his
[SPEAKER_01]: last joke and be like alright guys that
was my set have a good time and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: walk off stage and come stand next to you
and watch the next guy on stage because
[SPEAKER_01]: The comedy is so good that they want to be
part of the crowd They want to be involved
[SPEAKER_01]: the comics and the comedians are still
blending together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's skank fest It's a good time said I
wasn't gonna talk too much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what talked a lot about it Alright
now I want to do a couple of shoutouts to
[SPEAKER_01]: a few people who support the show on
patreon Quick shout out to my friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Jessica Kay a big shout out to shorty why
and a big old Fist bump to my buddy og
[SPEAKER_01]: purple thumb Alright now we are going to
work our way into the question and answer
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of today's podcast as I start this
I want to give a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody out there in Florida Everybody
on both coasts who have suffered from
[SPEAKER_01]: hurricanes the hurricanes have been
tremendous There's been a lot of damage a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of destruction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also been some That is never good
I may have to bleep that word out just for
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube censorship purposes But there's
been a lot of destruction a lot of turmoil
[SPEAKER_01]: because of these hurricanes Big shout out
to all those people I do send a big fist
[SPEAKER_01]: bump to you a lot of jaw love to all those
people Lots of protection for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you recover from all the turmoil very
quickly Hope things get back to normal as
[SPEAKER_01]: close as that can be for you as quickly as
possible now that is part of why we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to read a question that involves a
question about lights and a power failure
[SPEAKER_01]: and a power problem a lot of people are
going to experience power problems at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point in time Electricity failure if
you're near the hurricane areas your power
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to go out this question kind of
got high Highlighted because of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's work our way right into this
question This question came from the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: help tab on I read genetics comm if you go
to I read genetics comm There's a row of
[SPEAKER_01]: tabs one of those tabs does say grow help
or grow questions Click on that tab if you
[SPEAKER_01]: send me a good grow question and I read
that question here on the podcast I will
[SPEAKER_01]: send you a coupon code for a free pack of
seeds and I read direct comm The question
[SPEAKER_01]: goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, it came from our friend who
wants to be called bad papa Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an interesting name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my new friend bad papa It
says with winter coming up and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: really big wrote over that the word
hurricanes because this is very valid for
[SPEAKER_01]: hurricane season It says will a power
outage in the garden cause a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long can plant survive without light?
[SPEAKER_01]: When should you consider using a power an
alternative power source and what problems
[SPEAKER_01]: could arise in veg and or in flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long could plant survive in low temps
if perhaps problem if perhaps A power
[SPEAKER_01]: outage could occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very good question now what I'm
gonna say to the folks experiencing these
[SPEAKER_01]: power shortages and interruptions Where
the hurricanes are if your power is going
[SPEAKER_01]: out and coming on randomly and going out I
would just say unplug everything and just
[SPEAKER_01]: let it stay unplugged until they get shit
figured out It's probably better for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and it's definitely better for your
equipment your ballasts All of your gear
[SPEAKER_01]: would rather just come on and stay on or
stay off then come off and on off and on
[SPEAKER_01]: all intermittently with power surges
coming through The house just unplug that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants should be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're in flower, they're not gonna
get light, but they'll stay in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll keep flowering if they're in veg
Eventually, they may flip into a flower
[SPEAKER_01]: phase That's when I would get in there
with some light every few hours and just
[SPEAKER_01]: wake them up It takes them a little bit to
fall asleep But if you get in there every
[SPEAKER_01]: few hours and give them light you can keep
those plants awake You can do it with very
[SPEAKER_01]: small lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep them awake Keep them alive,
but you can keep them in veg if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: give them a little bit of light but what
I'm saying is if you've got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: power interruptions just Unplug shit,
let that stuff rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let all the gear rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it keep coming off and on that's
more destructive to your gear There's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more stuff that I did right down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question did start with winter is
coming So let's focus a little bit on this
[SPEAKER_01]: winter aspect of the question There is one
part that says how long could the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: survive in low temps if perhaps a long
power outage occurred if you are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: be in that house you personally as a
person are able to be in that house and be
[SPEAKER_01]: safe and be comfortable the plants are
just fine those plants Can survive very
[SPEAKER_01]: very low temperatures if they are healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about maybe some hydroponic
plants That may be a different story if
[SPEAKER_01]: you got water in there those roots get
super cold that could be problematic for
[SPEAKER_01]: you But these plants can't handle quite
cold temperatures We always thought
[SPEAKER_01]: certain temperatures were as low as they
can go But a few years ago it snowed here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado very early We got a very early
snowstorm and there were some very healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: crops that survived that snow So we've
seen extreme we've seen snow on the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: you had to go outside and shake the ice
and snow off Of the ganja plants and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of up to the plants It's up to a
lot of other factors, but they can survive
[SPEAKER_01]: very cold temperatures If you're in that
house and you're not dying those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are probably just fine So the winter is
coming something I would focus on if you
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the south if you're near these
hurricanes I would be more concerned at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point with humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to maybe open a
window I don't know what you can even do
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're gonna get a lot of humidity if
your grow is trapped in the house and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have power those plants even in the
dark will create humidity they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be breathing they're going to be
transpiring and respiring and Moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: will be happening into the air in that
room the humidity from the pots the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the soil itself will be letting off
humidity So depending on the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: of the room and the environment you may
have a humidity issue in there You may
[SPEAKER_01]: need to vent a fan do something waft out
that humidity somehow may be the other
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to deal with Let me give a quick
read make sure I cover this whole question
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we'll send you a coupon code For
a free pack of seeds from I read direct
[SPEAKER_01]: .com Once again, make sure you check that
spam because sometimes that's where those
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon codes go winners coming power
outage How long can they survive without
[SPEAKER_01]: light?
[SPEAKER_01]: They could survive a very long time
without light, but they may go into flower
[SPEAKER_01]: So to prevent that go in there every few
hours with some light and give them light
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's an intense flashlight shine
the light on them and wake those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will come awake When should when
should you consider an alternative power
[SPEAKER_01]: source?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in flower, it'd be cool to have
an alternative flower source but most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the time if it's too Three maybe four
days, which it usually doesn't go longer
[SPEAKER_01]: than that and we're if you're in the
states Most of the time except for that
[SPEAKER_01]: one time in Texas and went pretty long But
most of the time you're not gonna need
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of stuff like that unless you're
in a hurricane area But then if you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: a hurricane situation is to grow really
the priority anyway You're using that
[SPEAKER_01]: generator just to run the basics of life
and keep the keep the family alive If you
[SPEAKER_01]: can afford a generator set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun get at it, but not everybody's
got that kind of funding I think you your
[SPEAKER_01]: plan to live three or four days without
power If they really needed to Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've covered most of the question
here the winters coming they can get
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty damn cold and then for the
hurricane season I recommend some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you're gonna do in there
open a window start fanning your arms I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know, but that's what I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that humidity already flew out with
the hurricane I don't know man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the humidity is high in Florida
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my dude bad papa Thank you for
the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I gave those hurricane people some
advice If your power is flickering off and
[SPEAKER_01]: on just unplug it that way if you get some
water, you're a little bit safer Anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox my dude
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of seeds at irie direct calm All
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have another question here right in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one also came from the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from ogjz Shout out to my
new friend ogjz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard for me to say for some reason
I really could mess that up This is a
[SPEAKER_01]: general grow question that goes a lot like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says yo rasta Jeff, I love what you do
for the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, thank you for noticing And I really
enjoy it when people use the word
[SPEAKER_01]: community in it when they talk about what
I'm doing for ganja Because I really do
[SPEAKER_01]: try to build a community the discord
community is strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The irie army is strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you I appreciate it and thanks
for letting me be a part and a leader in
[SPEAKER_01]: the community that's a it's an honor to be
welcomed into this community because uh
[SPEAKER_01]: This community is uh, it's it's tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just making sure that my recording
gear is working right I got a weird
[SPEAKER_01]: flickering light going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is popping Up good up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, i'm getting paranoid now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, the question goes when breeding
and collecting seeds What is the easiest
[SPEAKER_01]: way to harvest the seeds from the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this one So, uh, you've got a crop
of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are fully seeded is what i'm going to
assume breeding and collecting seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the easiest way to harvest the
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the plants are done, I chop down
the entire plant I hang it upside down I
[SPEAKER_01]: get the plant tag and I attach it to that
plant so that it will not come away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant that Tagging that plant will
continue together for the rest of their
[SPEAKER_01]: lives when that's a bag of seeds That
plant tag ends up in the bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll travel its whole life with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any confusion so Chop down
the plant hang it upside down put the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tag on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use um It's from the brand stir light is
what they are They're little bins that are
[SPEAKER_01]: made to store clothing under the bed
little like a tupperware or a rubber made
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic bin Uh, you're supposed to put
clothes and shoes and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_01]: under it put the lid on it and slide it
under the bed for storage I Put one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those underneath the hanging plant so that
if any seeds do begin to fall out They
[SPEAKER_01]: land into that little plastic bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen for a while,
but it may happen So i've got each plant
[SPEAKER_01]: hung up kind of spaced apart with the
plastic bin underneath it and then we let
[SPEAKER_01]: it get to a very specific dryness
Percentage I need a very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of dryness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've i've discovered a very precise unit
of measurement Which I prefer the moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: level in my plants when i'm going to start
the next step so the next step is to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants to that precise unit of
measurement and that precise unit of
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement is Dry as fuck get these
plants dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want them crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them So what i'm gonna do i'm gonna
put on gloves And i'm gonna put these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants i'm gonna just chop them into
smaller pieces and put them in the bin I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna grab the stick and i'm just gonna
pull the nuggets right off the stick Just
[SPEAKER_01]: shuck that bud right into that plastic bin
i'm gonna get all the buds off the sticks
[SPEAKER_01]: into that bin and then i'm gonna take my
gloved hands and i'm Just gonna grind all
[SPEAKER_01]: that bud into dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just grind it all up gently i'm not gonna
crush the seeds But i'm gonna grind all
[SPEAKER_01]: that flower material up and you'll hear
the seeds just fall out into your bin And
[SPEAKER_01]: all your weed will just be all in your
face It'll be all piled up everywhere in
[SPEAKER_01]: your bin And then you can kind of tip that
bin to one side and scoop the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: material up to one end All the seeds will
roll most of the seeds will roll down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom And you can scoop a lot of that
we call it chaff the bud material that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have seed I don't use that for
anything that goes in a compost bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that That's gonna ruffle a lot of
feathers, but i've beat the shit out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so beat up that if I make
edibles with it They come out green and
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't taste good because all the
chlorophyll if I may concentrate same
[SPEAKER_01]: story all that Material has been so
disturbed that there's so much chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: just oozing out of it that it makes bad
products So it's all trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it makes good great compost and
good bokashi starter, but uh, so I take
[SPEAKER_01]: that buds I just pull them off the sticks
and then now I got a bucket of buds or a
[SPEAKER_01]: tray of buds and I take my Take my gloved
hands and just crush up all those buds I
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of do this like it just crunch
crunch crunch and just crush it all up and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll hear the seeds fall out the
material will fall out and Then there are
[SPEAKER_01]: several ways from there to remove the seed
from the chaff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a machine It's called the easy
seed seed sorter the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy seed seed sorter It looks like a
shoe box and it's got a shoot on top you
[SPEAKER_01]: pour your material in and it's got a
couple of trap doors and a fan and I am
[SPEAKER_01]: not a physicist but the way that it works
is the Fan blows the weed material this
[SPEAKER_01]: way So all the light stuff goes this way
into a drawer and it falls and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are heavier than that So if the fan
doesn't blow them and it blows those into
[SPEAKER_01]: another drawer and I can open a drawer and
I got seeds in one and material in another
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll dump those seeds into a little
bin and then I'll run that material one
[SPEAKER_01]: more time honestly just to be careful and
make sure I get all the seeds because
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it'll miss a few but I'll give
it one or two runs maybe a third run
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how much material you try and
That machine pulls it apart Very very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also another machine that looks
like a It's a plachinko.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a plachinko a chinko
plachinko machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what that shit's called
back in the day There's another machine
[SPEAKER_01]: it's made it's constructed from wood and
plexiglass and it's much taller It's a
[SPEAKER_01]: much bigger more cumbersome machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Wouldn't fuck with that unless you've
got a lot of seeds to sort But this one
[SPEAKER_01]: hooks up to a shop vac and you put two
five gallon buckets underneath it and you
[SPEAKER_01]: pour your material in there and it works
on the same principle but the shop vac
[SPEAKER_01]: will suck the weed material up and your
seeds will fall through the other side you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to You got a bucket of weed material
and a bucket of seed material and then
[SPEAKER_01]: your shop vacs got all the really light
weed in it So that's another thing that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available If you just Google hemp seed
sorter these things will pop up both of
[SPEAKER_01]: these will pop up the little white seed
box that I use is not available currently
[SPEAKER_01]: those are all sold out but the The other
machine with the plexiglass on the front
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can watch it operate that is
available both of them Work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like mine because it's much smaller
doesn't take up very much space However,
[SPEAKER_01]: it does make a mess that fan shoots a
bunch of material I have to do it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garage And then there's a lot of sweeping
up to do don't do it with the car in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garage because your car will be tinted
green But let me make sure I'm staying on
[SPEAKER_01]: track When breeding what is the easiest
way to harvest the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Get it dry as fuck and then just pull
the stick right out of the buds Let the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds all gather into a bin and then crush
it all up and then there are several ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it If you don't have one of the
machines I talked about I've heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: people just lightly using a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be real careful if you do use
the vacuum It is real gingerly suck the
[SPEAKER_01]: material off the top and get that leave
the seeds on the bottom You can probably
[SPEAKER_01]: gingerly figure out how to suck the
material up and get those seeds out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there you guys I apologize for the running
nose that just started happening on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast I'm telling you I'm recovering
from that Las Vegas skank fest plague and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not over yet It keeps kind of it's
perking back up All right, where were we
[SPEAKER_01]: dry as fuck is the precise unit of
measurement and then get all that material
[SPEAKER_01]: out of there before you seal those seeds
up in anything make sure that all that
[SPEAKER_01]: green shit is out of there and make sure
everything's nice and dry make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no moisture left in there because
you don't want to get moldy seeds and that
[SPEAKER_01]: is still a possibility All right,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gee Jay Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking about breeding I love
talking about seeds if you have any more
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding or seeds questions, please do

[SPEAKER_01]: let's keep this party moving I do have one
more good question here in front of me
[SPEAKER_01]: this question also Came from that grow
help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from somebody we're gonna
call James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my new friend James James
Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a good answer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes a little bit like this
It says hey Rasta Jeff, how can I
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively deal with fungus gnats?
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are out of control My first
piece of advice is stop over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet a lot of your plants are over
watered Also, I bet you've got house
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and I bet those plants are all over
watered as well those fungus gnats Come in
[SPEAKER_01]: on house plants those fungus gnats come in
in bags of dirt They breed very rapidly a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of over watering will encourage
more fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stop over watering a little bit Stop
over watering your house plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also check your drains in your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes those drains get a little bit
funky You'll start getting some fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: gnats some little bugs flying up from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe those drains need a little bit of
treatment There's a lot of things you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do for those as well That may be another
source of your fungus gnats the drains all
[SPEAKER_01]: the drains in your house the shower The
sink's check on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds funky, but that's where
they will like to congregate So check all
[SPEAKER_01]: your ganja plants your house plants all
those drains if you can cover those drains
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea That'll keep the fungus
gnats from coming up there squirt some
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon juice put a cover on it That'll help
you out really quickly But stop over
[SPEAKER_01]: watering the plants the house plants and
the ganja plants is the first piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: advice Let that soil dry out a little bit
that will let them die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't be able to breed in there They
won't be as happy in there defoliate the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowers if you're if the lower part of your
Ganja plants are touching the dirt take
[SPEAKER_01]: that off of there defoliate all that lower
shit I like to defoliate a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms of the plants that'll help
mitigate a lot of the bug problems Then if
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to do some chemical treatments,
this is when I would recommend a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: dredge This is very easy to do if your
plants are healthy This will not cause any
[SPEAKER_01]: problems at all if your plants are a
little angry and don't have healthy roots
[SPEAKER_01]: This could cause them to get a little bit
pissed off But what I would do is I would
[SPEAKER_01]: mix up first of all I would try a soil
dredge with a very simple product called
[SPEAKER_01]: mosquito bits or mosquito dunks it comes
in a mosquito dunks and bits are really
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to find the Dunks are easier to find
than the bits in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I order the bits on Amazon They show up
quite quickly mosquito dunks or mosquito
[SPEAKER_01]: bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the same thing just in a different
form One's a big donut once the donut
[SPEAKER_01]: already crushed up which is advantageous
because I'm gonna tell you to crush the
[SPEAKER_01]: donut up anyway Put some of that mosquito
bit stuff in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put too much put a bunch of it
in There mix it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see it floating around a little
bit in there then water the plants This
[SPEAKER_01]: method will not bother your plants at all
The any plants can handle this do this to
[SPEAKER_01]: all your plants your house plants your
ganja plants water it with the mosquito
[SPEAKER_01]: bits Water it just like you normally would
water water as heavily as you normally
[SPEAKER_01]: would let it dry Once it dries water with
this again What we're trying to do is get
[SPEAKER_01]: this in there a couple of times and really
saturate the plant with the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that is in these mosquito bits
That'll make those bugs get the fuck out
[SPEAKER_01]: of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't want to be there They can't
survive they will leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first attempt is the mosquito dunks
or mosquito bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a nice water with that They're
very available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find them at Target Lowe's Home
Depot Possibly your local mom-and-pop
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware store, but they are very
available Get those in the water water the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants also water the house plants that
will help any standing water You've got
[SPEAKER_01]: around you could throw some of that in
there that will help get rid of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mosquitoes and the little fungus gnats if
that does not work then that's when I
[SPEAKER_01]: would step up to either evergreen or
Pyganic or maybe even Botanic Garden Max
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would do a soil dredge with one of
those three products Don't mix those but
[SPEAKER_01]: do a soil dredge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start with evergreen do a small
maybe 15 to 30 mils Per gallon of
[SPEAKER_01]: evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of heavy Maybe go a little bit
lighter if your plants aren't in good
[SPEAKER_01]: shape So go ahead and do a soil dredge
with the evergreen get that down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil That way the bugs don't want to be in
there Then let them dry up and then repeat
[SPEAKER_01]: that again in about two to three days if
The plants look healthy enough to survive
[SPEAKER_01]: through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna do some damage to the roots
because it is oily It's gonna frustrate
[SPEAKER_01]: them, but that's how we're gonna get rid
of the bugs if you really want to if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're bad Also do a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do the Pyganic foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do the evergreen foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do Botanic Garden Max There's
several foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already got the evergreen because
that's what I recommend for the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: dredge You could spray it with that but I
think two doses of the soil of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mosquito dung Should get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, step up your game do an evergreen
dredge do it again in two or three days
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really want to get frisky in
there go ahead and spray at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably should spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, if you've got fungus gnats,
there's also an opportunity You got some
[SPEAKER_01]: other bugs go ahead and hit it with a
decent spray of the evergreen or the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyganic All right, my dude James Make sure
