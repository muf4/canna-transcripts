[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 488 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Infinity
OG live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Loopa's Headmand and
I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
gas, earth, and bitter skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells ridiculous, it tastes
amazing, and it is super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, the label says
it contains 65.06% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for this delicious and potent
[SPEAKER_00]: Infinity OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to cover a
couple of breeding terms that I left out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's give a shout
out to a few of our friends that support
[SPEAKER_00]: the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Grow From Your

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to talk about some
breeder talk in this episode, but before I
[SPEAKER_00]: get there, I've got a couple more things I
should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that is really important,
my friend Clint just left and he wanted me
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure to tell everybody hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out from my friend Clint to
all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint, come back on the show sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out when you've got more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a stranger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Clint wanted me to say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him I would say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out from Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about my garden update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, I like to update you folks
on what is happening in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been following along,
you know that I recently pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: several females with a reversed blueberry
cookies pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a blueberry cookies female plant
that was treated with a solution that
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged that plant to create pollen,
which only contains female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen will be put on several
selected females and that will make
[SPEAKER_00]: several lines of feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that room of females being pollinated
by the reversed blueberry cookies is of
[SPEAKER_00]: course another blueberry cookies female
that will receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a female of my favorite
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there is a Durban poison in that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also may be a couple of other
females in there that have not been
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by this reversed blueberry
cookies before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when those seeds are done, I will test
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get some out to my other tester
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if they are up to par,
if they meet my standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, we will add those to the
lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time I reverse the blueberry
cookies, I will make more of those and we
[SPEAKER_00]: will release those with the rest of the
lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the females in the room have been
successfully pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols are starting to get brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of curling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been about three or four days since
I pollinated and I can already see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are plenty of seeds developing in
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cleaned up most of the excess pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken a shot vac and sucked up all
the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll clean up the room real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I just need to keep feeding
the plants really well and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: In just a few days, I will adjust the
timer and I will give my plants more light
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage healthier fatter seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds should finish in about 50
to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode should come out on December
11th, which means those seeds should be
[SPEAKER_00]: ready around the end of February.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what is happening in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had successful pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can visibly see that the pistols are
curling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can visibly see the spots where seeds
are beginning to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the equipment in the room seems to
be in good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is running properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit cold outside,
which makes it really easy to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures in the room nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to compete with the hot,
sunshiny days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a very successful
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to increase the amount of light
hours, which will make the seeds harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also be fatter and more healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, I think we're on the perfect
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on to the main topic of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I wanted to cover some glossary
terms, some things I may have missed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: previous episode when I was talking about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into that and talk about some
popular terms that you may see on seed
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see in forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just may hear people talking about
when it comes to growing and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of those terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I kept saying to work
something, to take a strain or a plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: work it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I mean by work it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that I bought a pack of seeds
from a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That breeder is called water bottle
because there's a water bottle in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this water bottle breeder sold me a
package of seeds and I grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a male out of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got free rein to breed with that
male because I have paid for those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can tell me what to do in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can tell me what to do with my
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can tell me what to do with my
plants once I've paid for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done my work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel the same way about the seeds
that I breed that are available to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got my seeds, you're allowed to
breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what my plants will do in
future generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like breeding is really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fulfilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's something you want to do,
my seeds offer great potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I almost encourage you to breed with my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pack of water bottle seeds
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy sold me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a male in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose to breed with that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't work the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just used water bottles work to create
more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I should do is use water bottles male
to some other person's female or another
[SPEAKER_00]: female that I've worked with and then
create my own seed and then use a male out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to do some work to it to kind of
make it my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just grabbing stuff off the shelf and
mixing it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to do a little bit of ingredient
working myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to do the work on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I mean when I say work it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just get a plant, get a clone,
get a male plant out of a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and do some dusting and make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it means a little bit more when a
breeder does some working, when you take
[SPEAKER_00]: things to different generations,
when you inbreed or outbreed or back cross
[SPEAKER_00]: or do some work to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to do a little work,
make it your own instead of just using
[SPEAKER_00]: that pack of seeds from water bottle using
his male and making my own seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just breeding for your own
personal fulfillment, feel free to use
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever male you've got access to that
fits your breeding criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to put something to
market, it's better etiquette to work
[SPEAKER_00]: something and build your own male instead
of just pulling something out of a pack
[SPEAKER_00]: and reproducing more stuff out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I meant when I kept saying
work it and make it your own in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward and talk about
something a little more useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a phrase that I hear quite often
that may be confusing to some growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: The phrase is clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I spoke about
Gorilla Glue number four being a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: only strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also talked about Golden Goat being a
clone only and Girl Scout Cookies being a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do I mean by a clone only strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by a clone only is that no
males of these plants were ever released
[SPEAKER_00]: and no seeds of these plants were ever
released by the original breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the female that was released is known
as a clone only because there was no way
[SPEAKER_00]: to reproduce that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way it was circulated was as a
clone, a very specific cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about specific
cuts and cut names in a minute here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm saying clone only,
I mean it's only available in clone form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like Golden Goat and Gorilla
Glue, those plants just happen to be
[SPEAKER_00]: accident but they are also clone only
because the person who created those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants never intended to make seeds for
commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seeds were never released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew those small batches themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they found the keeper, the prized cut
out of those seeds, the star phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they gave that clone out to their
friends and they never released any males
[SPEAKER_00]: or any seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a clone only female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know people are already going,
but I've got seeds of Golden Goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put out seeds of Golden Goat,
how can that be a clone only?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are breeders like myself and many
others who have learned how to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: plants which means I can take a clone only
plant and I can treat it with a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That solution will trigger a hormone
reaction inside of the plant which makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it create pollen sacs which contain pollen
which only contain female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take that female Golden Goat pollen
and put it right back on a female Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat plant and I make female Golden Goat
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until that became a popular practice and a
lot of people started learning how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it, these clone only strains were much
more sought after and were much harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do believe if you grow my Golden
Goat from seed, you should label the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of your plants Golden Goat S1
because it is not the original Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a very close representation but
it is your responsibility to properly
[SPEAKER_00]: label it as a Golden Goat S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what we mean when we say a
clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were never seeds released by the
original breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you're going to find seeds of
that is if somebody made feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or perhaps maybe somebody did a back cross
but that needs to be labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making seeds, please learn how
to label them correctly and please do not
[SPEAKER_00]: mislead people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also said we would talk about
specific cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I hear that there's a strain and then
there's a specific cut of that strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very popular example is the Mack from
Capulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mack is a plant that is available in
seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can buy Mack seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mack is also available in a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a very popular Mack cut known as
Mack 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also known as Capulator's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Cap did release the Mack in seed form
but he has also shared his favorite cut
[SPEAKER_00]: with his friends and there is a story and
some rules that go along with the Mack
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to share it with growers that
you respect and people that you feel will
[SPEAKER_00]: deserve it and you cannot take money for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be gifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some rules that come with that
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate and respect that but
the one that Capulator gave out to people
[SPEAKER_00]: is Cap's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Mack 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has been labeled Mack 1 and Cap's
cut to indicate that that is the sought
[SPEAKER_00]: after prized cut from that batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy the seeds but you cannot label
any of the seeds that come from that batch
[SPEAKER_00]: Cap's cut or Mack 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can label it the Mack if that's what
the seed pack says but you cannot call it
[SPEAKER_00]: Mack 1 because Mack 1 is a clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the first strain that came
to the top of my head when I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about strains that are clone onlys
that have their own specific name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may also be known as a Breeders
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a prized cut of my Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I've got almost unlimited
amounts of seeds of Arise that I can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown a lot of Arise plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to select my favorites out
of countless seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a cut that is a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to release that I call that the
Breeders cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one everybody would want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best one you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've culled several to replace them with
this one and I upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I find one that's better that one
replaces the older one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have got the Breeders cut of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Arise number four that I've
released to a few friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carefully label it Arise number four
because that is a popular sought after
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Breeders cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how some of these strains get
their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they get called specific cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see like the profit, the 505 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because the profit was bred by irie
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my friends down in Albuquerque found a
very beautiful phenotype of the profit and
[SPEAKER_00]: they call it the 505 cut because they pass
it around and they share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when other people grow the profit
and they offer clones and they're like hey
[SPEAKER_00]: I got clones of the profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their friends will probably go you got
that 505 cut or did you just grow it from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed because everybody's going to want
that 505.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the special one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you get specific cut and
specific cut names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get regional cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get Breeders cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also dispensaries have very popular cuts
of certain strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a dispensary in Denver that grows
the Lemon Jeffrey and they have got a very
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful phenotype of the Lemon Jeffrey
and they do offer clones of it on
[SPEAKER_00]: occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get those clones you have got the
Kind Love cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to Kind Love you get Lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call that the Kind Love cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one they run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that they share.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are known for that cut of that Lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how these certain strains get
their cut names or their sub names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're either grown by a grower who is
popular and they get the cut named after
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rasta Jeff cut or it could be regional
or it could just have some sort of a story
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a popular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that happens is sometimes
the breeders will identify specific
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes before the seeds are released
and they will tell you to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: specific phenotypes within the batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am known for identifying phenotypes in
my batches and I give very good
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions of the phenotypes on some of
my podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go off on a little mini rant
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop talking so much about
desirable phenotypes because those are
[SPEAKER_00]: what are desirable to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing a pack of seeds from
seed I feel like you should find the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that is more desirable for you
and your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of don't worry about what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got good recommendations but
sometimes I feel like when I start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about phenotypes I sway people's hunt and
they don't get what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get what I want and that's not why
we're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not why we're pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to back off a little bit on
some of my phenotype recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still make descriptions and things
but I'm not going to recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I often say that one's the
keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may get away from doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say the one you like the best is the
keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me try to figure out where I was
and get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working my way into talking about a
breeder who tells us about specific
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes of a specific strain and what
I'm getting toward is jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy jilly bean we know that we
can look for the candy store pheno and the
[SPEAKER_00]: orange pheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two very popular and very
reliable phenotypes that will come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: a pack of jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two very popular phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always hear about the candy store jill
and the orange jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically what we mean when we
say like basically a subtitle or a sub
[SPEAKER_00]: name to a string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hey I've got the jilly bean and then
your buddy will go do you have the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: cut or the candy store cut and you'll go
oh and then if you've got both of them if
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow a pack of seeds it's very likely
you will get the candy store and the
[SPEAKER_00]: orange and you won't know when you smell
it you'll go oh that's obviously the candy
[SPEAKER_00]: store then you smell the other one you go
oh that's obviously the orange dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jilly bean is very well known for the
orange and the candy store phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you start hearing those
subtitles I guess it is when we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now really quickly I should cover land
race genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an expert when it comes to land
races.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always said that there are seed
breeders and seed collectors then there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a subculture of land race growers breeders
and seed hoarders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of the subculture within the
subculture the extra nerdy among the
[SPEAKER_00]: nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my take on land races is essentially
this land race seeds are seeds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired from a region where the plant and
the cannabis breeding has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupted by selection from man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about in some places
they've got a large field of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growing outdoors they let the males and
the females grow side by side they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those male plants open pollinate all of
the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants are harvested those seeds
are dropped right back into the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally just from the plants being
shaken by the harvest method just by
[SPEAKER_00]: nature just by being there those seeds
fall back into the ground then next year
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds grow up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male and female plants are allowed to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males are not cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those males pollinate those females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each female plant contains seeds from
multiple male plants from that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this happens over generations over
generations without being adulterated by
[SPEAKER_00]: mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody goes there and disrupts the
breeding of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that people are doing is
removing the finished plants we are
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the seeds to fall and they are
allowed to grow next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't doing any selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature is doing all of the selection here
for these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that grow the best in that
environment they thrive and they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those plants with survivor instincts
get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males get to shoot pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The future generations have those traits
even more solidified.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been happening for generations
among generations without interruption of
[SPEAKER_00]: mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are land race genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to one of those regions and you
acquire those seeds and you bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: back home those seeds you acquired were
land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you fuck with them that
offspring is no longer a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can label it secret Tibetan mountain
F2 or you can label it something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: but you cannot call it a land race
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been adulterated by mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is no longer a land race worked by the
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be people who argue with my
definition of what a land race is but to
[SPEAKER_00]: my understanding to my standards that is
what I would call a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds that have been unadulterated by
human interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been breeding and selecting
themselves in nature in their own
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and they have adjusted
themselves to grow through evolution in
[SPEAKER_00]: their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls pimps and hoes friends and foes
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers and growers.
