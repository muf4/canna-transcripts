Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back podcast world, I'm your host
Rasta Jeff this is episode 827 of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart podcast I've got another
great show lined up for us in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out We'll talk more about the free
seeds later on in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you that the dude
grows cup is coming to Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado on June 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us at the dude grows growers cup in
Fort Collins, Colorado on June 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team irie genetics will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there white mic will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude will be there Scotty real will be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be a huge party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to join us at the dude grows
growers cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out DGC cup.com for
all of the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's work our way into
some people's new favorite portion of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out there has a grow room pet
peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something that happens in a
friends grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something that has happened in
a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something you've seen on the
internet online on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me know what is your grow room pet
peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know something drives you crazy out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know your grow room pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your peeve here on the podcast,
I will send you a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of irie genetics premium seeds off of
irie direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of peas in one paragraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a grow room pet peeve that did
come from my friend Shawnee Mack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says Hey Rasta Jeff, thanks for all
you do for the community, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you really help empower both new
and seasoned growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are very thankful for your
willingness to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an amazing compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to be empowering growers,
new and experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually the goal of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means a lot to hear that I'm hitting
that exact goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've got a pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: My example is when I'm listening to a live
show or a podcast and they have someone
[SPEAKER_00]: either in the community, in the comments
or a guest being a know it all and not
[SPEAKER_00]: being open to have a conversation to talk
about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing themselves a disservice by
being so hard headed and it just leaves a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect from your friend Shawnee
Mack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Shawnee Mack, I agree with you in so
many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frustrating when there's a panel,
a group and one person does like to just
[SPEAKER_00]: try to take control and push their agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit I do talk a lot when I'm on
other podcasts, but I understand what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm educated on the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to listen and I try to give a
positive and useful insight when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking on a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just try to talk about random
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have something that pertains to
the subject, something that could help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do understand not everybody is as
good of a guest as we would like them all
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will talk right over you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are there with an agenda
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought them on a show where maybe
we're both a guest on a show to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: germinating seeds, but they want to talk
about their new nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every other paragraph out of them is
about their new nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the know it all is in the comments,
the know it all is on the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is super frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many ways to grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it bothers me when you come up with an
idea, you start talking about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this often happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of industries I've worked
in that this happens in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get off on a side tangent
here, but this one is what makes the show
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've shopped at Guitar Center and I've
shopped at grow stores in the past and
[SPEAKER_00]: they both have the same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in there and you tell the person
what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Hey, welcome to either a
garden center or a guitar center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either fucking one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, Hey, welcome to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to do today?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say, yeah, I'm trying to complete
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need part B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got A and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need part B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you show me where that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like at both of those places,
the guitar center and the grow center,
[SPEAKER_00]: they both go, Oh, your idea sucks,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way it's going to work is if you
do my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so frustrating when people
can't, they don't even know my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know my situation, but their
way is better than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only their way will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does drive me crazy and frustrate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love it when I look into a garden and
I see I can go, Oh, these people listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the show because they're growing three
gallon pots with cocoa with perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the light set up the way I talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't grow the way that I do,
I'm totally fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the way that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow what works best for you and absorb
the knowledge and information that works
[SPEAKER_00]: best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, there are a lot of
podcasters out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other podcasters grow a different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they grow, but I know
it's different because they're not in my
[SPEAKER_00]: room doing it the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all grow a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the same thing with a
different style with a different twist on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take the information you get that
applies to you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't apply to you, take it with a
huge grain of salt, and then judge the
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe of the podcaster that you're
listening to the guest, whoever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it sounds like this person
already knows who they do and do not want
[SPEAKER_00]: to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there are so many ways to grow
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those know it all do drive me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard headed folks do drive me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else that drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is coming from a person who is a
podcast viewer and also a podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: producer, but also I'm a guest on
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a lot of different perspectives
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when podcasters interrupt guests,
it drives me freaking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that problem on this show,
because it's just me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's interrupting, it's probably
Mike interrupting me and I approve of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they'll get a good flow going,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have a host and a guest,
and then a co host maybe or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just even the host, they'll get a good
flow going and they'll be like question,
[SPEAKER_00]: answer, question, answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they finally, they got a warm up to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a couple of questions and answers
and some chatting to get comfortable on a
[SPEAKER_00]: show, but then they'll ask that one
question that we've all been waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the breeder or the answerer or
sometimes it's me, I'll get excited like
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, I'm excited to answer this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm excited about the question,
I know that the listeners are excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about my response because I've been asked
freaking everything on a podcast by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ask me a cool creative question,
shout out to Chad Westport for asking cool
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me excited and I get excited to
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start telling you something really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk for a couple of minutes and
tell you something really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then about 30 seconds into that,
either the co host or the guy that asked
[SPEAKER_00]: me the question will distract me,
interrupt me, ask me another question and
[SPEAKER_00]: sidetrack that, you know, I don't get to
finish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to keep up with the show
and keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I answer the second question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The audience, if I'm the one listening to
the show or the one on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the audience got screwed out of
hearing that sometimes I go, ah,
[SPEAKER_00]: shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to hear that answer, but the host
will just talk right over the guest,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even give us the opportunity to hear a
really cool answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just let a guest talk sometimes,
uh, you'll get a really cool story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get really cool details that you
never would have gotten with just a
[SPEAKER_00]: straight back and forth, uh, just
question, answer, question, answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid fire sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let a guest talk is something that I
really enjoy or that is a pet peeve when
[SPEAKER_00]: people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't let the guest talk,
that drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what also drives me crazy on podcasts
is when, um, I'm talking to a camera right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any feedback from an
audience, but I know you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm imagining you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm imagining some people over there just
snacking popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are hitting the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are just scrolling into their
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are on their car.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, um, I don't get any feedback
right here, but when I'm talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody or when I watch a podcast where
it's two people talking back and forth and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just question, answer, question,
answer, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like it to connect a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it drives me crazy when the guy's
like, what's your favorite color?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you grow up?
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you drink soda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you eat tacos?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such a boring interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see people connect a little bit
more, but I do agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a podcast listener, a podcast
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a producer and a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to sit in three different chairs
and see three different perspectives of
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting and everybody does it
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the podcasters do it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it differently than the dude grow
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude grow show does it differently
than Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all do it differently than tad
hussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, everybody just has their own style,
but, um, I do agree with you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does drive me crazy when there is a
know it all either on the show or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have something to say,
but I feel like some people just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: type into the comments just to show that
they can type and have something to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend, my new friend, Shawnee Mack,
bro, check your email because you do have
[SPEAKER_00]: a coupon code for a free pack of I read
genetics, premium seeds at I read direct
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thank you for the great
pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did get me rambling there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the show started off super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a pet
peeve that you would like to share with me
[SPEAKER_00]: once again, please do send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your pet peeve here on the show,
you will win a free pack of seeds off of
[SPEAKER_00]: irie direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this momentum going
and work our way into the grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That website is irie genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs says grow help or grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a grow question, or if you
need grow help, or if you have cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: culture or community questions,
you can use that grow help tab there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will ask you a few preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may ask you about the temperature
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain are you growing indoors or
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to fill out that stuff,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not go right to the bottom,
you can ask us your grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your grow question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds off irie direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question in today's show came
from our new friend Daniel Daniel,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening for a little over two
years and I love your style, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you like my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says, I have a question here that
I hope you will clear up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I feed Synganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you know how much I love the
word Synganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to let that one fly this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you think a product like push
would or could help with your yellowing
[SPEAKER_00]: midflower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any feedback would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wraps it up with tax time is soon
and I'm going to hit up irie direct for my
[SPEAKER_00]: next couple of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, thanks for the help,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have to wait for tax
time to hit up irie direct because since I
[SPEAKER_00]: read your question here on the podcast,
you will get a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of irie genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into the answer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is experiencing yellowing and
midflower and they're asking if push could
[SPEAKER_00]: or would help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellowing push, of course, is a foliar fed
product from our friends at hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the folks that put out the
product of veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also put out shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great set of products that they've
got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, will the push product
help with the yellowing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it is going to be the
solution that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you are experiencing or what the
plants are showing you is a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, which means those plants
basically need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed them push, they're going to
start cycling even more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're going to see more
deficiencies because of the already
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient nitrogen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I really think you need is
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I would recommend is more
nitrogen late in the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you can't do that now, but when you
do grow this plant next time, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: continue the nitrogen, your base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you're doing synganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what kind of bottles or
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your combo there of your
synganic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's kind of why it throws us off
and I have no idea what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that some of it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is bottled stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I would recommend is if you
grow this same cultivar, this same plant
[SPEAKER_00]: again, is that you give this plant more
nitrogen late in the veg phase and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue that nitrogen a little bit later
into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know this plant's going to use
a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's burning out early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will receive most of its
nitrogen in that late veg phase and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will store it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will use a lot of that stored
nitrogen into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this situation, it seems like you
did not have enough of that nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: stored up, so the plants are running out
of energy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bottle feed with the
nitrogen-based nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also foliar feed with that
nitrogen-based nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do the push.
[SPEAKER_00]: The push is, like I said, the push is
going to probably make the plants try to
[SPEAKER_00]: go faster than they're already going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to create more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not use the push unless everything
looks good already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push is not a fixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push is an enhancer in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, I wouldn't use it to
fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's push.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called push.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like everything else is already in
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's fucking push.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think push would be for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the yellowing that you are seeing
is a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely, most commonly, that yellowing
is a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would boost up the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do that next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do it by increasing that in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add more nitrogen later in the veg
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it store up all of that so that it can
use that early into the flowering phase
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep feeding it the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably not using an A and B,
a veg and a bloom bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say that somebody is using veg
newts, and then they're going to flip to
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this particular plant, I would keep
those vegetative nutrients in the mix for
[SPEAKER_00]: at least one more, maybe two weeks,
and then switch to that flowering nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were using the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think that the problem here is
a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you may want to check
on and you may want to dial in is the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: of the feed or the water going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: into your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress too much on the pH of the
soil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be chasing that forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will always be in flux based on how
wet, how dry that soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH will always be changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on the pH of the solution that is
going into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's a bed, a pot,
or what you're working with, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing shit up, if you're pouring in just
water, adjust that pH and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend somewhere between 6.2
and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pick a number that you like that you
think will work for your setup and stay
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent when you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may also help with your nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really think happened was these
plants took off on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're showing a little bit of
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing to do is feed them
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this chasing the plant and it's
definitely getting away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Daniel, thank you for
the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do check your email because you've got a
coupon code for a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to stop now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question came from our friend who
wants to be called Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one once again came from that Grow
Help tab on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, hey Rasta Jeff,
hey Brian, thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just want to start off by
saying thanks for all of the knowledge you
[SPEAKER_00]: give for free and for inspiration to
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, those are two great things to get
compliments for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing that the podcast is
free, that I don't charge a thing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: 825 episodes available.
[SPEAKER_00]: On YouTube, go listen to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for saying that I inspire
you to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding cannabis gives me joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to pass on that skill and
that joy to somebody else that puts a
[SPEAKER_00]: smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm about to start popping some
of your feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I bought these seeds and I'm
wondering if I pollinate those feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it make more than usual amount of
female seeds or just the usual 50-50?
[SPEAKER_00]: Male, female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of weird ideas,
misconceptions, myths, misnomers,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question that pops up
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to this is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should probably get 50% male and 50%
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this seed, if this plant came from,
if your female plant came from a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seed or a feminized seed, it will not make
any difference when you breed with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it will produce more male or female
seeds, it will produce 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference in that feminized
plant and a regular plant is that there
[SPEAKER_00]: were no male chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend, Mr. Soul,
because Mr. Soul kind of put this idea in
[SPEAKER_00]: my head this way of thinking about femme
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the way that it works,
but this is a good mindset, a good idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grasp feminized seeds and how they
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is if maybe
hypothetically I had a male plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: here and I've got a female plant over
here, when I'm producing feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it that I magically created a
force field that does not let male pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: get to my female plant, because in my
opinion, in my experience, in my studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen is what determines the sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have gone back to the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I believe that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can make feminized seeds from
female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about my theory, my idea that I
want you to wrap your head around is the
[SPEAKER_00]: only difference is that I have sucked out
of the room all of the male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say that the pollen's coming
off of that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of that pollen will be a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of that pollen will be a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a security guard standing at the
door going, ladies only, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I've got a shop vac that only sucks up
male pollen or a filter that only gets
[SPEAKER_00]: male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only girl female pollen has made it to
the female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that pollination has happened,
everything is the same other than no
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be all females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I want to give credit to my
friend Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the one that put the idea of to
teach the vacuum, the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good metaphor of how to
teach feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how it works at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's much more work to it than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about fem seeds,
the only difference is that they are all
[SPEAKER_00]: girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no male pollen, no male
chromosome available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically put up a barrier and we kept
all the dudes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ladies night party on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, my friend, was the really long
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be exactly like any other plant
that you ever breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the short answer is probably
50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see anomalies and
variation in every breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get some that are 70% males,
30% females, and the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, you will see a 50-50
mix in the progeny, whether you're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized female or a regular male-female
produced female pollen receiving plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was a lot of technical words in
one sentence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that was a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, thank you for the great question.

[SPEAKER_00]: There is a Smoker's Lounge chat where
there are probably five or six,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven or eight really cool people hanging
out right now, smoking, dabbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about life, talking about growing
ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what they could be talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a Grow question and you need
some help right now, there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody in there right now that could
answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pop in, join us on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a link to the Patreon server
at patreon.com forward slash grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure you use that Grow Help tab
at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a person who wants to
be called Old Head Willie.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Old Head Willie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, make sure you check your email
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a general Grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question starts off with, Good day
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good day Willie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I got a question about lighting
when in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to switch tents mid-flower and the
light spectrum from the lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one they came from is more yellowish
and soft compared to where they are
[SPEAKER_00]: currently, which is more white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the change in light spectrum affect
the plantain anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without reading the second half of this,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light spectrum can change a lot of things
in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will show a lot of different
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for an example, I've got a room
running right now that's got a high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium lamp, a metal halide lamp,
and then a few LEDs lined up on the outer
[SPEAKER_00]: perimeter just to give some extra light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see a difference in the sections
in the room that are getting different
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the different performances based
on those different lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HPS light is the one to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little more ragged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look as healthy as the light
next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That metal halide light, those plants look
a little bit more healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been overfeeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants underneath the metal halide are
taking the overfeeding very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not showing as much abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants under the high pressure sodium,
they look a little bit pissed off about
[SPEAKER_00]: that overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a little more than their
nails done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting the tips and the edges are
getting a little bit crinkly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I need to pull back on the feeding,
but no, I want to push them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my global party how I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can see a lot of variation in the
structure of the plant, the shape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, the bud development, the
stretchiness of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants under the metal halide did not
stretch as far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants under the HPS, they're
stretchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their branches are kind of falling over
and more gangly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see a difference in that room
just by the plants that are under
[SPEAKER_00]: different lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that are under all three look
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one row that gets hit with the
HPS, the metal halide, and the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants look freaking stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I we will see some difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights will make a lot of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown, so for several years I grew
under high pressure sodium lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my go-to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bang out really nice crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one year I decided to switch to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants looked totally, totally
different when I switched to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were shorter, squatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the same thing, but a little
bit wider, more compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inter nodal spacing got tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branching got tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still branched out, but they didn't
go and stretch out real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just went bang and stretched out real
strong and real stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw differences just switching from
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see some difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he does go on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I've seen the plants kind of hit
pause for about two weeks before they hit
[SPEAKER_00]: their stride again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't show any deficiencies or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went from a, you said from a light
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came from a yellow to a white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just probably adjusting to that
new spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: To them, it's a new season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, why did the sun change?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun was yellow for so long and now the
sun is white.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to figure out what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm not sure when you did the
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did this at like week two,
week three, they might've just been
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning and they were just changing
their hormones around anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just went on stall mode because
they were confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, now this is my in-between run
where I run eight, one gallons with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six of the eight were, are dialed in and
doing wonderfully, but the pause was
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's probably just, they weren't
mad or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to figure out why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like imagine if you woke up one day and
the sun went from orange to white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, you'd go, ah shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be really confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the fruits and vegetables would go
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything would be strange out from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going, hey, why is the light
different colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: It thought it might be a different season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take dabs before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, are there potential pros or cons
when switching light spectrums mid flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get mid flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could the slowdown caused by the change or
was it from something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was most likely caused by the
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that growers like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we like to do as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the obvious cause of something,
but we like to doubt that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop second-guessing yourself as a person,
as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be confident in your first decision and
trust your intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably right, probably correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overthink things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's most things in life, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I'm going to assume that the
slowdown was because of the switch in
[SPEAKER_00]: light spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you went from more
powerful lights, less powerful lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a different spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that changed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they think you moved them
from the top of the mountain to the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the mountain, or maybe from Colorado to
Florida, or maybe even from Colorado to...
[SPEAKER_00]: let's pick some more way different...
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just picked some more different that
maybe I might want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just moved them and they're going,
where are we, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it was the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a different... not only is the
DLI different because of the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting a different spectrum,
a different PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighting is way different,
but also I bet you the VPD changed with
[SPEAKER_00]: that because the it's in a different tent,
which means a different light,
[SPEAKER_00]: which probably different air flow,
the light's going to give you a different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to create a different humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things change to these plants that
they're just going, what the fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're going to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get their shit back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you can switch from that
HPS or the metal halide to the HPS about
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks in, you won't see a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a thousand watt,
or if you step up and go, if you go from a
[SPEAKER_00]: six to a thousand, you shouldn't see much
slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think you just confused them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I think you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to switch lights,
you guys try to do it more gradually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go up in wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go down in wattage and try to pay
attention to the spectrum and try to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper spectrum for the stage of
flowering, which you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a lighting expert to help me do a
podcast about lighting because I honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: am not qualified to talk, teach too much
about grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the plants very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how all that stuff works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deeply understand breeding, but when it
comes to lights and stuff, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something in my brain that just doesn't
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ADD stops me from learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a lighting expert out there
that would like to come on the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: teach us the basics of lighting,
I'm all ears and our audience would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach out, grow from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I am super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually end the show right now,
but let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more message here on today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called one deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this did come from that grow
hell tab on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm growing indoors in soil using
HLG lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it best to pre-mix your nutrients and
let it aerate for 24 hours and then water
[SPEAKER_00]: or should I just mix pH, check PPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, don't let that shit sit out for too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not meant to sit for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is meant to be mixed, stirred up,
pHed and fed to the plants as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why all of this stuff is
sold in different bottles because when you
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in one thing, there's a chance
that they will bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your heavier nutrients are going to
fall to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighter shit is going to float to the
top overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to notice the different
things lock up and bind together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will sink to the bottom and get
all shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not let that stuff sit out too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up, stir it, use it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely check that pH, check the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people are going to say, what about
hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff's in there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting stirred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're shaking the bottles the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to feed it in pots,
this person said that they are in promix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, mix it up, water it as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and does it matter if you use
compost teas with bottled nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the compost teas with bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to burn anything,
not to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those compost teas should give you
some good life in your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those beneficial bacterias,
get them more active, which that does work
[SPEAKER_00]: as a good buffer to help get those
nutrients balanced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the microbes in the soil work with the
exudates in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell the plant what to uptake a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, all those buffered and chelated
nutrients are going to get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a whole other episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I know it's a lot to go over,
but I would really like to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on how you water and feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly, I could tell you on how I
water and feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use anything from a five gallon
bucket to a 35 gallon trash can to a 155
[SPEAKER_00]: million gallon drum, whatever we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a personal grow, I just use water from
the tap because our municipal water here
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a commercial grow, I would run it
through a big boy filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do not do, what is it,
RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That causes more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sets you up with more struggle to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill up my vessel with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to add some sort of potassium
silicate or a silicate product,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one goes first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that in there at the recommended
dosage or whatever I think I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me for burping at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But add the potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will start with my base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I using right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypothetically, we're going to say we're
going with the Botanicare Pure Blend Pro
[SPEAKER_00]: line because it's very easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use the Botanicare Pure Blend Pro
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much of that as I feel like I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour it into a measuring cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one I use for a five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would use about 100 to 125
milliliters of that base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour that into my five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would continue down the line,
whichever nutrients I need for this mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably some Cal Mag, the recommended
dosage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably something with some Bloom
Booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm just guessing what else might go
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all my liquids in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I add my powdered microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes go in after I adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I feed it directly to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on, again, the size of the
room, the amount of plants, the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hypothetically, if it's a small space,
I'll use a pitcher, like a Kool-Aid
[SPEAKER_00]: pitcher that you'd get at Walmart for
mixing up lemonade or Kool-Aid or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to put on the Fourth of July
picnic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dip that into my big container of water
and just hand water my plant as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to water, most of the time,
I use a three gallon pot with a soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mix and a personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a three gallon pot with a soilless
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will water and probably about half to
three quarters of a gallon of water per
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dry enough to take that,
that's usually when I like to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's if you've listened to Watertech 1
through 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll hit that half to three quarters of
a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then usually that will give me just
enough runoff to almost fill that runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: tray, that saucer underneath the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll almost fill that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not dump that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people go and collect that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are healthy and stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole pot's filled with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little bottom part isn't going to get
too angry with some extra water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's how I buy myself an extra
day or two of watering when I go out of
[SPEAKER_00]: town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mix it up, pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I mention pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I throw in the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the microbes go in, I also check
the EC or the PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write all that shit down, throw in the
microbes, give it a good solid mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just go in there and water each
individual plant as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wait for that runoff to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the commercial grow, I will document
the pH and EC of the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal grow, I don't feel the need
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember what's going on a little bit
better, and it's my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm accountable for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to take that note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could, I should, but it's my grow,
and I feel like I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's going on in there enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm paying enough attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the commercial grows, I've got room A,
room B, room C, building A and building B
[SPEAKER_00]: with rooms A, B, and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit gets overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take all those fucking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my personal grow, I think I can
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to document the EC and pH of
my runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got enough going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me see how much of this
message I covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I really like to know my thoughts
on how I water and feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did the quick version,
just like most people, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill the container, silicate first,
mix it up, base nutrients, liquid karma,
[SPEAKER_00]: cal mag, bloom booster, carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that can go in almost any order,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silicate first, then the base,
then just tag on everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH it, mark down the pH and the EC,
throw in the recharge, mix the fuck out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and then water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nothing real challenging,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoner is really what works best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, there'd be a
lot of, we'd plug some shit in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would all water for me, but keep it
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoner is what seems to work the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got super rambly.
