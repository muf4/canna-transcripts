[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure if you're watching the YouTube
video, you have noticed that joining me on
[SPEAKER_03]: the microphone today is a coffee and
red-faced white mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you're having a great evening,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just watched you take a pretty chunky
dab there, watched you cough for a few
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes while I tried to stumble through
that SeedsHereNow ad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was splendid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dab and the ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you take a dab of, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the last of my sour diesel
ambrosia from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't the last dab of something delicious
kind of a bittersweet moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, this is delicious,
but it's also the last bite.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one bites the dust.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to do that on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit focused, as focused as we get
here on two guys coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, since you asked, I am smoking purple
Starburst live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a four-gram jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is now a four-gram jar minus two fat
dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've taken a couple of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a three and a half-gram jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just about three and a half grams at
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a blend of purple punch and
Skittles and Starburst OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the package, the flavor is described as
spun sugar, grape and shampoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oddly enough, I didn't read that label
before I thought that it tastes like
[SPEAKER_03]: cotton candy and shampoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it tastes like... When you hug
it, I'm really tall and you're a tall guy
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hug a pretty girl and if you just
rest your face on their hair, it always
[SPEAKER_03]: smells like strawberries or pretty
shampoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go all Biden on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've hugged pretty girls and they smell
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They smell like fucking good shampoo,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what this smelled like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled like a fruity, good shampoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hug a pretty girl, or maybe it
smelled like Bed Bath and Beyond,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a good candle in there, just to keep
myself out of trouble with Mike and the
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like girl shampoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, it's got me stoned and rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the back of the package, it says it
contains 54.84% THC and non-detectable
[SPEAKER_03]: amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not a really high number of THC,
but it got me stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to assume the rest of that is
turps because it is fruity and fragrant
[SPEAKER_03]: and pungent.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I open the jar, I can smell it from a
distance from my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to put this one up to the
nose to give it a sniff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can smell it from quite a ways away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I'm smoking purple Starburst.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine is not the last dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a fresh jar, so we get to enjoy
this for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Mike, this is the point in the
show where we do a shout out to the folks
[SPEAKER_03]: who support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are still under a corona type of an
environment, so I'm not going to smoke a
[SPEAKER_03]: bowl with you guys, but I will pack you up
digital bong rips and digital dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll roll up some digital joints,
some digital blunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to pass those all out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off with a giant shout out to
our buddy, The Stoned Trout Bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out.

[SPEAKER_03]: Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dive right in and see where the
emails take us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's dive right in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you've got random shit on your
brain to spout out and I just wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: see where your brain went today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Patreon contributors,
this one did come from a new Patreon
[SPEAKER_03]: supporter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to our friend, Totally White
Tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent us this message on Patreon and
it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope all is well out there in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: All is iry bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for checking on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're keeping to ourselves, behaving
ourselves, trying to stay safe and
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's kicking with the fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously we're recording over Zoom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're doing our best to stay safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: This says, I'm a somewhat new grower up
here in Michigan with just a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: grows under my belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the gang.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Bruce Lee started off as a white belt
at one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I recently got some of your lemon
Jeffrey and orangegasm seeds and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: popped three of each.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a great start.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a really good, the orangegasm
will be really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lemon Jeffrey not as easy,
but still it will be a breeze because
[SPEAKER_03]: you've been listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I can't wait to see what I can do
with these lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I plan on running each of the strains
separately in two by four by six tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that's a two foot wide by
four foot deep by six foot tall tent,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably in three gallon radical bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a good setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question to you is with only having
about five feet to work with for height
[SPEAKER_03]: wise, due to my lights and carbon filters
at the top of the tent, at what height
[SPEAKER_03]: would you suggest flipping my ladies from
flower to veg so they don't stretch too
[SPEAKER_03]: far and grow up out of control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for any help and suggestions man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growers love and stay iry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growers love back at you and you stay iry
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, we can shine some good light on this
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're asking, well, they've got two
different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to have to do two different
analysis here or breakdowns, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: planning to 24, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: 18, say that again, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 18 to 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would go, yeah, somewhere around
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got, but they've got individual
tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got, they're going to run them
separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask if that's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like, that sounded like what you
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've got six individual tents?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're not going to run them in
six different tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to run the strains
separately in two by four tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've probably got two tents,
but either way, the advantage that I see
[SPEAKER_03]: there is that we've got the orangegasm in
one and the lemon Jeffrey in another,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really helpful because they don't
grow the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: One gets, the lemon gets quite tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The orangegasm stays a little bit shorter,
a little bit squatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So doing them separately is going to
really help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good move there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lemon Jeffrey will double.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can count on that plant doubling in
height during the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within about the first three weeks of
flower, it is really going to take off.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do popping and twisting techniques,
I'm sure you've listened to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grab the plant at one point,
grab it at another, give it a twist right
[SPEAKER_03]: in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do that all the way up the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will slow down that stretch.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant will focus on repairing that
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not slowing down any bud growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant would be stretching anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hormones are kind of shifting over.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will help slow down that stretch,
but that lemon Jeffrey is going to double
[SPEAKER_03]: in size by the time it is done flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be ready for a double in size.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you've got a six foot tall tent,
probably five feet tall with the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the height of the pot?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say whatever height you've got,
measure that from the pot to the light and
[SPEAKER_03]: then cut that in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go a little more than half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave yourself a cushion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we don't want to be touching the
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need some space away from that light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike makes a very good point there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grants don't like to kiss the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very, very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's talk about the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_03]: The orangegasm is going to stretch,
but not as radically as the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say a third, maybe not double,
but it will get a third as tall,
[SPEAKER_03]: a little more than a quarter, a little
less than half.
[SPEAKER_03]: So measure your space and flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can grow that accordingly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now something I would really
recommend, if you're in a tent,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're in a two by four by six tent,
it will be really, really easy to trellis
[SPEAKER_03]: that down and fill that space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could grow it up to where it's a
few inches tall, then put a screen down
[SPEAKER_03]: and spread it out horizontally instead of
vertically until you've got all of that
[SPEAKER_03]: space filled up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had a box and I said, put as much
weed as you can in there, would you just
[SPEAKER_03]: put a bunch of spears or would you try to
layer that shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's try to fill the space the best we
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've only got two by four by six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost any light is going to get that
spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's trellis them down and get them
going horizontally and then put another
[SPEAKER_03]: net where when they grow up, they grow
into that net.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is going to buy you a lot more space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look like a lot more space
until you do it and then you realize how
[SPEAKER_03]: much more plant is actually in there,
how much more biomass can actually grow
[SPEAKER_03]: once you spread it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lemon Jeff is going to double.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one is going to grow about a
third.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: About 70.75.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know how to do the math on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as big as the lemon Jeffrey,
but I would recommend in those tents,
[SPEAKER_03]: scrogging them out so that you can control
them a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can keep them short in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can bend them down and then when it's
time to flower, just give yourself plenty
[SPEAKER_03]: of flowering space and then put another
net up so they can grow into that net for
[SPEAKER_03]: supports.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any input on that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like you had something to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scrogging was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even consider it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're in that small of a space and
you're worried about height, why not scrog
[SPEAKER_03]: them down?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've got full control of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when you flip them, they'll start
growing straight up and you've got all
[SPEAKER_03]: that space filled up.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look in there, it's just rows of
colas instead of just a few sparse buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll really make a big
improvement in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally white tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate the great message and huge
thank you for the generous Patreon
[SPEAKER_03]: support.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that today and I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have another email here in front of
me, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one will definitely get your
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep scratching my nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to take a minute and try to
get the itch.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to take a minute to scratch
that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me if you're watching the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: My nose itched really badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got another email.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one comes from, they said their name
is Brandy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I can say their name, but it says,
oh, it says right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use my name on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should my question make it on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, shout out Brandy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to use your message and say your
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I love the show and I'm glad to
be a Patreon member.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned a 50% of what I know about
growing from you and I've taken so many
[SPEAKER_03]: notes from listening and re-listening to
the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much great shit in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon contributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 50% of what you learned, you have
learned from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means your garden probably looks a
lot like my grow and that makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope you're doing a really good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for listening and
re-listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go back and re-list.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just, they think they learned
it all the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says hands down my favorite weed
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all the work you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm loving the Zoom shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, people are loving what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Mike for joining me on those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says my question is quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make it kind of long
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a medical dispensary in Oklahoma
a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drove, oh, we're not going to say,
okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drove up from Missouri where I have a
medical card and I'm able to use it in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oklahoma for a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reciprocity is a great advantage and
addition to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going to load my bowl this
morning with some blue dream and I found a
[SPEAKER_03]: shit ton of seeds in my weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they bought some dispensary weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got some blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went to pack a bowl and they went to
tink, tink, tink, tink, tink into the
[SPEAKER_03]: tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says after I messed around with the
weed and it's all crumbly and dark green
[SPEAKER_03]: and almost yellow in color.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they got some very, yeah, the face
you're making Mike is accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some very sub par disappointing product
that still probably costs top dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says at first I was happy because I
scored some seeds, but now I'm feeling a
[SPEAKER_03]: little duped and jipped because my entire
ounce pack I bought seems to be loaded
[SPEAKER_03]: with seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unacceptable unless it is clearly
labeled seeded product.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be minimal seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should find one seed per ounce at
maximum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, it's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even want that one, but I mean
shit happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: One seed per ounces.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of them are a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I says, I'm wondering, is this normal for
typical medical dispensaries or is it
[SPEAKER_03]: weird for my medicine to have so many
seeds in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody screwed the pooch and you got out
of state ID tagged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, do you think that's what they did?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this person's not from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just give them a shit bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here for how long?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get, no, get the other jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's possible, but all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my take.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, or maybe this dispensary dispensary
just has a bunch of shitty seeded weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what they're selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all boo.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wrap it up with thanks man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep being iry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm half Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Island love.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says lots of love to you and yours from
the Midwest signed Brandy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Brandy, you should not have gotten any
seeds in your product from a medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody had a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a light leak.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a hermaphroditic plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what went wrong, but that's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go to weed maps and I would leave
a solid review.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be rude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be rude about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say, start with an email,
reach out because maybe it was an honest
[SPEAKER_02]: mistake and maybe they want to take care
of it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they don't, that's what the,
the mic is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've processed a lot of medical cannabis
at more than one facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times would you not notice an
ounce loaded with seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to bash a dispensary,
but if they missed, they knew they had,
[SPEAKER_03]: they knew what they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not worth the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: They already knew what they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They already fucked them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go to weed maps and say, Hey,
this happened to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you don't go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the opportunity to make it right
the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, if you want to send the email,
if you're a kind person, if you're real
[SPEAKER_03]: gentle and patient, go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they knew what they put in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if a chef serves you raw fish,
fucking chef knew he was lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew that fish was definitely hit him
up and, and contact them and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I, I picked up an ounce at CD.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd have weed maps open and I'd be
ready.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be ready to go home.
I'll be ready to go home.
Yeah.
So that's how I went on the show in
decision-making.
I was on the show in decision making.
We worked at C CD Press and they told me
that they needed a reseller, and I signed
[SPEAKER_02]: up and I was reading the comment roasting
them while I was on the phone with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And take a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read it if they do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't do you right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the world know this is where you go to
get city CD product for full price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm sure they didn't give you a
seated discount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just in a shop the other day
and I smiled because on the shelf,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had clearly labeled on their discount
shelf, this is outdoor that got seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the price was a little less than half
of what the same quality jar right next to
[SPEAKER_02]: it was, that wasn't seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: But have it clearly labeled, that's
perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's completely acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I say seeds in this herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis consumer has been dealing
with seeds forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's bait and switching people is just
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be part of the ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to buy your bag of weed and then
go home and then do your process,
[SPEAKER_03]: however you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get all the seeds out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting home and going through a bag and
getting all the seeds and stems out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a way to pass time in high
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put on some whatever you listen to and
some Grateful Dead and pick the seeds out
[SPEAKER_03]: of my weed and smoke a couple bong loads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody had a special dish or a tray or
a magazine, something.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of my friends thought they had to
have an album cover just because they all
[SPEAKER_03]: tried to be hippies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they all had a, either it was either
the wall or terrapin station.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all my shout outs to all my hippie
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who you fucking are guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ride around in the van and get
lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put on my Gencos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is still wearing his.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a little dog dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were good days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there should not have been any seeds
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take a picture of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when you do decide to contact
whoever that you've got a photo of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: take a picture of the product and then
don't go to that place again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of shops in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go there and check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what you can find.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also there are a lot of shops in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you visit Colorado and check
out some of the recreational shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you don't travel home with any
illegal medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just have to say that as a podcaster and
all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Rasta, Jeff and White Mike are
fictional characters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now the question that I have Mike is
about those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first it sounded like our friend Brandy
was a little bit excited in one sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was happy because I scored some seeds,
but now I'm feeling duped and jipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they look if they're good,
and what do they look like if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: crap, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if they're crap seeds, they'll be
white.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be if they.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not about what the seeds look
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like doing a fucking covid-19 test
visually over Zoom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't tell if you've got covid or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can you can if they're tiger
striped here and the money if they're big
[SPEAKER_03]: there are tiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you might want to try to grow them
if they're white and tiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can tell if they crush when you
squeeze them really lightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are dead dull.
[SPEAKER_03]: non viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do choose to grow them,
you sounded excited like you might be
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in growing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do grow them if you've got room and space
and if you're not going to get in trouble,
[SPEAKER_03]: but keep in mind that you have got a wild
card there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know why those seeds occurred in
that garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a male that got out of control?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the best case scenario for you as
the consumer with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: For everybody else, that's the worst case
scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there was a male that got missed
and it pollinated, you've got a male
[SPEAKER_03]: female cross, which is the best case for
you in that grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means your seeds are going to be the
most viable, the most successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be boys and girls in there,
but they won't be terrible mutants,
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully, possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have a hermaphroditic problem
that caused these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: A female plant could have been stressed in
a way, or it could have just been
[SPEAKER_03]: triggered to show intersex or
hermaphroditic traits and it would have
[SPEAKER_03]: thrown out male sacks that would have
created pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of seeds for a herm plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got enough to be pissed off,
like if you really got a bunch,
[SPEAKER_03]: that means that plant really hermed out on
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really spit out a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that rate, you have got the
opportunity, the potential to have
[SPEAKER_03]: straight up hermaphrodites or also
feminized seeds or also straight up crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of variables here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have really good feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way you're really going to know
is to grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got some space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're relying on a grow for
medicine or for product or for profit,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you can't do it as a hobby and a
passion project and kind of a science
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment, I wouldn't grow these.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were tight on money and you can't
afford a little bit of electricity,
[SPEAKER_03]: some nutrients, don't grow these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some reliable seeds from a
seedbankseedsherenow.com coupon code
[SPEAKER_03]: GFYH10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some reliable seeds from a breeder
that you can trust that has packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you've got are like, those are like
pound puppies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know the pedigree.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could have been beat to shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be just ready to bite you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no idea what you got there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want something that came from a
breeder with some pedigree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, if it's not going to set you
back to grow it, if it's free,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you've got time for a hobby,
if you can afford some soil, some
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity and some dedication,
grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you grow them, keep a strong eye out
for problems early, early on, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: all the way through flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early in flower, you should see male
flowers pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see the males.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find the guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll pull those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, the hermaphrodites will show
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then see if the girls that are growing are
worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way to tell us to grow them,
but you always have to make sure there are
[SPEAKER_03]: no hermaphrodite signs popping up in these
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plants like to go seven or eight
weeks before they even let you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: boink, I've got male balls on me
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're like, no, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seven weeks in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been flowering this plant for seven
weeks and it's showing me a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I try to pick the nanners out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I spray it with water and try to cut
off that one bud?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I just risk it because maybe they're
non-fertile?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the word for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sterile flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many different options for that
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay really close attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have limited access to seeds,
just want to have a project, you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: throw some shit outdoors, these could be
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said throw them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you really have to keep an eye
on males and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pollinate Mike's outdoor and my
outdoor and Jesse's outdoor, we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to come looking for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to cut down your crop and take
yours because we don't have one this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happens in a farm community if
you fuck up and let the males go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do have a bunch of free seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry you didn't get any medicine out
of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is disappointing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way to stop that is to grow your own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to all the podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said they learned how to grow most of
their lessons from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow these out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow them side by side by reliable stuff
and compare them.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've read my fucking brain, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla glue was an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden goat was an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my assumption, girl scout cookies was
probably an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem dog was an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have the next gorilla cookie
chem scout something in there that is
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may get to name it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out of Blue Dream, so it's only
got so much potential, but you may get to
[SPEAKER_03]: give it a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to try not to rip on Blue
Dream when you went there anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gentle about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a joke, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been part of the, it's a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say it out loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been part of the Fuck Blue Dream
gang.
[SPEAKER_03]: For quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream is a quality strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it works for you, let it do your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew, consumed, sold, smoked,
traded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much Blue Dream that everything smelled
like Blue Dream and it was ridiculous for
[SPEAKER_03]: a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you would say Blue Dream,
my insides would cringe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to make some money,
if you've got a production grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to kick it the fuck out,
Blue Dream will pay the bills,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it also, it doesn't get me as stoned
as I could try to get off of some fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just like to pick on Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to call it stripper weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll get the girls nice and lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're a connoisseur and you're
really fucking dabbing up and smoke that
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream like it's water, nothing will
happen to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've got a cool Blue Dream cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what you got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, do you want to jump into more
emails?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've only been going for, I'm going to
guess 25 ish minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we cut the people short.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't give them at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do another email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a pile of emails here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had those two prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see how long I think this one might
take us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was going to be a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's two pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know guys, this is maybe going to get
edited, but we may just go right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's just read this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, we're going to keep the
show flowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to read the one on the top
of the pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they want their names said?
[SPEAKER_03]: This one comes from a dedicated and a
grateful man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before getting too far into this email,
I like just to give you a heads up that my
[SPEAKER_03]: email does include my real name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not going to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you read this on the podcast,
if you do happen to read the whole,
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry, I'm trying to catch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's parts I'm not supposed to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get on with the reason I'm emailing
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just recently discovered your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am eternally grateful that I'm lucky
enough to have done so as you are by far
[SPEAKER_03]: the most best in the business when it
comes to cannabis education, or at least
[SPEAKER_03]: you are in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a great way to start a really long
email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you found us and I'm glad that
you find I'm the best for education.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't find it a competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say that all the time, but even when
there's no competition, when someone tells
[SPEAKER_03]: you you're the best, it feels damn good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where else are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: My love and undying passion for cannabis
started about two years ago when I spent
[SPEAKER_03]: some time with my father in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: There I smoked cannabis for the first time
and I truly discovered how wonderful and
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing this plant truly is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to California and California
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not shared this fact with many
others other than my closest family and
[SPEAKER_03]: friends as I now live in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many, if not most of the people
surrounding me are strictly anti-cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: as I once was before I decided to make my
own decisions to educate myself on this
[SPEAKER_03]: wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, welcome to the team.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude's walking around with a secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I smoke weed and it's so
fucking cool and I can't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the dark side, homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come hang out with us over here in
Colorado where we are all open about
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes on to say the friends and family
that I have chosen to confide in have
[SPEAKER_03]: reacted surprisingly well and I'm thankful
to them for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably smoke too, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking for smoke buddies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with that being said, however,
it has been over a year and maybe two
[SPEAKER_03]: since I've even been around cannabis in
any way, shape or form and I am scared now
[SPEAKER_03]: to even talk about it as is like so many
others who choose to keep their love for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis to themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I have a job and many other good
things I would rather not have taken away
[SPEAKER_03]: from me just for consuming a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here I am rambling again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but dude, we like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there really is a reason I
decided to contact you, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, that's a good setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know a little bit about you and I feel
like we're friends now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, as I stated previously,
even though I have not been around
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis in close to two years now and my
love and passion for it is still
[SPEAKER_03]: undeterred, I decided that a major goal of
mine would be ultimately to get a job as a
[SPEAKER_03]: consultant or a lead cultivator or a
breeder or any other job that will allow
[SPEAKER_03]: me to be around this wonderful,
magical plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done countless hours of research and
listened to all the grow lessons and the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcasts all the way from 351 up to 385.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he's way further than that by now
and I intend to continue to listen to the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast, old episodes and news so I can
absorb all the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot more, but I think the
question is how can he get into it?
[SPEAKER_03]: He hasn't been around a plant for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I may return to California to do
a grow of my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's no substitute for
experience from research, but it seems
[SPEAKER_03]: like the number one thing a company wants
is experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I would like to take a
horticultural course from Oakster Dam
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know that if nothing else,
it will look good on a resume.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't expect to enter the industry as a
lead consultant or a lead cultivator,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I hope to get able to get there with
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most important thing I wanted to ask,
here we go, is do you have any tips to get
[SPEAKER_03]: into legal cannabis other than just
putting out a resume and hoping for
[SPEAKER_03]: someone to hire you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any and all tips?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, where are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it impossible to get hired in the
industry without hands on growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, this case won't be for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in case worse comes to worse for
anyone else wondering the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're busy, but I got your email
on the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will continue listening to the podcast
and I have as I have done for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, make sure to get a little medicated
for all of us out here in Prohibitionland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, a dedicated and grateful man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry I stumbled through that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in a really small font.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why the fucking font came out
that little, but I felt like an old man
[SPEAKER_03]: reading that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friend here has a passion for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, where they are,
they cannot get any hands on experience
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis, but they would like to
enter the legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to know if we've got any advice
for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of ways to go about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, as someone that hires
growers and helpers and people in a
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation facility, I kind of like
people who don't have bad habits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to train people right than it
is to break bad habits and train them
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is sort of an advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are guys out there that show up and
they're like, I've been growing for this
[SPEAKER_03]: long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can identify fucking pest problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can identify fucking nutrient problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to work on things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys are great, but also they got
some ego problems and they're too trained
[SPEAKER_03]: and programmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to come into my grow and do it
their way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to do it their way because a
home grow is way different than a
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, your home grow works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep killing it, slugger, but we've got
millions of dollars here and we've got to
[SPEAKER_03]: make this shit work every day repeatedly
on schedules, on cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody like yourself that doesn't have a
lot of experience, who doesn't have bad
[SPEAKER_03]: habits, who isn't trained to fuck shit up
that I can teach fresh from the start is
[SPEAKER_03]: very valuable to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do have an opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the passion that you convey in this
email comes through in the interview,
[SPEAKER_03]: the enthusiasm, the passion, the eagerness
to learn, the willingness to learn and
[SPEAKER_03]: adjust, that helps you out in an
interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me want to put you on the grow
tech team and see what you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a couple of things I wrote
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you say you want to be lead
cultivator, lead somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike shaking his head, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the cannabis industry, everybody has to
start off as, yeah, you got to start on
[SPEAKER_03]: the bottom somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's already a lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually if the lead cultivator quits or
gets fired, the lead grower becomes lead
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivator and then everybody just shifts
up one step.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only way to get in that line is to
start at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're either a trimmer or you're either a
grow tech or a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the main three places you enter
into the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're lucky to enter as a grow tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to find my grow techs from the trim
room when there are tasks that need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: done, when I need a hand, if I need
somebody to do something random and you
[SPEAKER_03]: show that you can do it, you can take
objective, you can learn it, you can
[SPEAKER_03]: manage it, you can get it done and get
back to your normal job and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck up the flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I need two or three things done in
the grow, I think about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day when Mike can't do it
because he got to do something with the
[SPEAKER_03]: kid, I go, Hey, what's our friend's name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dedicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to work in the grow today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mike is sick or Mike's off taking
care of the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, Holy, should I get to be
a grow guy today?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day somebody will quit or
somebody will not show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I say dedicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been dedicated for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're the grow tech and you go,
Oh, I'm working here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day I'll get tired of the
bullshit from the manager at that facility
[SPEAKER_03]: or the owner of that facility or the
consultant at that facility or another
[SPEAKER_03]: facility will offer me better money and
less hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll take it and I just won't show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not how I really do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just saying I'll fucking move on
because that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I move on from facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get them rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get the staff trained up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a good solid flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once the music is rolling on
itself, they don't need a conductor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take off and let the band play on its
own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, one of those growers takes
the reins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you move up, they move up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can shift up forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you show that you've got initiative and
you can follow instructions and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: basically following instructions a lot of
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, being able to do extreme repetition
correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't no thing to have three plants and
to defan those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three thousand plants is a different story
altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires a different process,
a different game plan, different
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques, different attitude,
different attack plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to just sit at a table and
trim five days a week, eight hours a day
[SPEAKER_02]: for six months before somebody says,
hey, instead of trimming nugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: now you get to pull fan leaves for five
days a week, eight hours a day for the
[SPEAKER_02]: next six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a real job.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is somebody that gets paid to
defoliate five days a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fill five gallon buckets up with
leaves, put them on a scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to weigh the leaves that are torn
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: They throw them away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole job all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you do is just slowly walk rows,
pulling fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else is slowly walking rows,
twisting stuff into trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody else is slowly walking rows,
checking piping emitters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another person is more quickly walking
around distributing predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're sachets or sprinkling them into
pots that all that shit has to get done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, don't talk about metric tags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, you're giving me small nightmares.
[SPEAKER_03]: The metric tags stabbed me low.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's all small stuff that needs to
be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we find entry level folks to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can do it correctly,
that's when we move you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you're going to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing at the retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody starts off as a budtender or a
greeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, hey, someone so quick,
you want to step up and be a manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody stepped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need somebody to do our marketing,
advertising, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be management, not only do you need
to be able to manage plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants are the easy part when it comes to
managing commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to manage Mike and I've got to
manage John.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to manage Brian and Elijah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I should put some girl names in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because we do have females in
there, I just try not to pick on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got to manage people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of those people have different
personalities, different lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't address Mike and Elijah in the
same tone of voice because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to learn how to get them to do what
I need done politely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And still sternly as a boss without
pissing them off and disrupting their
[SPEAKER_03]: personal just because how people are.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you tell some people, hey, bro,
fucking go do that real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I tell Mike, hey, bro, go fucking
shut off that water before it overflows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said fucking and bro, Mike's OK with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I say, Sarah, go fucking turn off the
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like I'm yelling at Sarah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to say, hey, Sarah, will you
please get the water before it overflows?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being management is a whole new game.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to think about every word and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to manage people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have to manage schedules.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many days do I need Mike here?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many hours can Mike work?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a whole other skill in itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have some people and some
team-managing experience, which takes
[SPEAKER_03]: years to develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still not really good at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I've got a decent hand on
managing a staff and getting a team to do
[SPEAKER_03]: what I need done and accomplishing a grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that takes a lot of time to develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I really caught here is
how do I apply?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I get noticed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: With any other job, you put together a
resume and you go around and apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike cannot see the paper on my desk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being out of state, you're kind of at a
disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike said what my paper says.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is now a regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just like applying.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wanted to apply to work at a Ford
dealership, you would email that Ford
[SPEAKER_03]: dealership and set up the proper contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wanted to work at the grocery store
over there, you would contact the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries, the grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much harder where you are because you
don't know where the dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_03]: grows are, but you've got a phone book or
weed maps or whatever works for you to
[SPEAKER_03]: contact places.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are groups on social media where you
can join that will actually help you find
[SPEAKER_03]: jobs in other locations in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there are groups online where you
are that will help you do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I didn't research.
[SPEAKER_03]: The group that makes me think about jobs
and finding on Facebook is the Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: Badged Network 2.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to send in a request to be in the
group, but then they will help you find a
[SPEAKER_03]: job in the Colorado cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's one for pretty much every
legal state now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then another thing, if you're coming to
Colorado or if you're going to another
[SPEAKER_03]: state that is ran by the marijuana
enforcement division, you need to ensure
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can acquire a marijuana
enforcement division badge where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: even apply to work in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without that, you can't get in at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't walk into a grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a worker, you can't walk into a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't touch any product without that
badge.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got crimes or weird shit on your
record, you may not be qualified to
[SPEAKER_03]: research and see if you're allowed to do
that before you move to somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: See where you'd like to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Locate some businesses in that area and
contact them.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if you can do a phone or a Skype or a
Zoom interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them know how eager you are to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then if it's time to relocate,
come on down.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do the- You've got two big
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to move, take the time to
pick a place where you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: happy and you're going to be allowed to
work because there are a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that came to Colorado that have felonies
on their record.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rule one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in other states, they're making a
point to not exclude felons because the
[SPEAKER_02]: people who were disenfranchised by
prohibition laws should have a crack at
[SPEAKER_02]: the legal industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado, we said, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got busted for weed two years ago,
10 years ago, don't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of good growers were banned already.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people that moved here to work in
the industry had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They moved across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They packed up their family.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have enough resources to make
that move again once they got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ended up working some regular job
that they could have had back home,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the time to research it or fight and
get it legal where you're at and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't got to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it on the ground floor where
you might not have to work your way up so
[SPEAKER_02]: hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start in the middle off if it's
your own place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, it's like you've got my notes in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to segue into that by saying
when you do get the interview,
[SPEAKER_03]: don't treat it like it's a stoner job.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need people that are dressed
semi-decently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't show up in a suit and shit,
but don't show up like a bum.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be around a lot of other
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need hygiene.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need professionalism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be on time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Treat it like any other job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good resume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dress, speak, and write professionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't show up with a bunch of homies in
the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bring weed to the interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be baked when you show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've literally seen all of those within
the last year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: People get weird when they hear it's a
cannabis job, but the important part of
[SPEAKER_02]: that is job, not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had somebody show up stoned as shit,
smoke coming out of their clothing still.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a group of six people in their
car waiting for them and the music was
[SPEAKER_03]: going through the whole building while I
was trying to interview this person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't hear their interview over their
own friend's fucking stupid music.
[SPEAKER_03]: That person did not get, I didn't complete
the interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it look like the interview was done
and then I said, well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do their application.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we pick you, you'll hear from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to call you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we covered most of this part.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to start at the
bottom and you're going to have to find
[SPEAKER_03]: out if you can apply somewhere and see if
you're qualified to work in whichever
[SPEAKER_03]: state you choose to, and then pick a good
location and then try to get in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like Mike said, do what you can to get
legalization happening in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you're passionate,
so maybe it may be easier to find the
[SPEAKER_03]: right people, team up with the local
normal organization and get you legal
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way you can create the rules and
then you can be a pioneer and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: start your own grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be one of the first to have a grow
in your area in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being first is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are not a lot of places where you
can still be first at things.
[SPEAKER_03]: America is getting populated quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got the opportunity,
you've got the opportunity somewhere to be
[SPEAKER_03]: a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pioneer that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dedicated and grateful man or fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you for the great long
email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, you ramble just like us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be part of the crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come hang out sometime, take some dabs,
come out of the shadows out there in
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody else out there has a cannabis
cultivation, cannabis culture question,
[SPEAKER_03]: we would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a mountain of emails here,
but I will get your email on the show
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Mike, I think this is a good
point to start wrapping up episode 534 of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap it up, homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you learn today, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have prepared you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made it through another day of pandemic,
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pandy, day 5000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did learn something today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fancier the sheets are, the faster you
got to get them out of the dryer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I learned today.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you know, people, the more you
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's red lasers, there's blues lasers,
and there's knowing, and knowing is half
[SPEAKER_03]: the battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_03]: smokers and growers, clone cutters,
seed collectors, pollen chuckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what rhymes with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my rhythm.

[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is all I have got for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last words, Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a Mike's moment for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick little rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a dispensary owner or manager or
even a trimmer, make sure you're trimming
[SPEAKER_02]: your herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten a lot of furry nuggets lately
during the pandemic, and I know
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries are getting off a little
light because people can't get up on the
[SPEAKER_02]: product and super judge it before we buy
it right now, but that's no reason to be
[SPEAKER_02]: slacking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your fucking sugar leaf where it
belongs in the trim pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the white Mike rant for today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it here, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the trim room trimming right
now and you work in a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_03]: trim that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're one of the people trimming it,
high five fist bump, but if you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit is a little leafy, bro,
come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it another pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one more spin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go back over it one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two eights recently that would not have
left the building if I was running quality
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have been sent back.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them, I would have taken back and
been a dick about it at the trim table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have dumped that shit out in front
of the whole crew and just shook it out in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of you and been like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed a rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was Mike's moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, thanks for listening to two guys
coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be back in just a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
buddy, totally white tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a smile, sun's about to fade in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm doing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm doing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would I know that this could be my
fate?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would I know that this could be my
fate?
[SPEAKER_01]: To what you wanted to see good has made
you blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you wanted to be yours has made
it mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't you lock up your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that you wanted to see fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hands up and shake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell on black days.
I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would I know that this could be my
fate?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would I know that this could be my
fate?
I fell on black days.
I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell on black days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell on black days.
I fell on black days.
