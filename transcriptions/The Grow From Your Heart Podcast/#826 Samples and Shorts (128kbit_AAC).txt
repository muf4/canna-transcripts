[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we
[SPEAKER_00]: go!
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody!
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 826 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I've got a fun episode lined up
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds, hang out, we'll talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the free seeds later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to take this moment to invite
you to the Dude Grows Cup that is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening June 1st in Fort Collins,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, the Dude Grows Cup is coming
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there, White Mike will be there,
the Ivory Army will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cordially invite you to join us at the
Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all
the links, deets, and info you may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tickets are on sale now, so get those
tickets because the event does sell out
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, now we're going to segue into one
of my new favorite sections of this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of course the pet peeve section of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the podcast where we
talk about something that just may drive
[SPEAKER_00]: you crazy in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you see it in other people's grows,
maybe you see it in pictures on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, maybe you work at a commercial
grow where some weird shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the section of the show where we
can air those grievances.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call this the pet peeve section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to share with you one of
my major pet peeves about growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: about the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is when a breeder gives somebody seeds,
and those seeds go into a collection box
[SPEAKER_00]: and never make it into any dirt or into
any grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you gals, you growers,
you smokers, we put a lot of work,
[SPEAKER_00]: we as breeders put a lot of work into
producing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we give you seeds, we're like,
hey bro, you want some new shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool that you want to keep it,
you want to cherish it, you want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it like a keepsake or something,
put it in that treasure box and keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: forever, but as a breeder, it would be
really cool if you grew at least a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of those seeds that I gave you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's my pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand they're like Pokemon cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to catch them all, you want to
collect them all, you want to have them in
[SPEAKER_00]: that vault, but as the breeder,
grow that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see what you do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my pet peeves is seeds sitting
in a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could start giving my friends
seeds that are already folded in paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that order tester seeds on the
internet, I wish I could send those to you
[SPEAKER_00]: already folded up in a wet paper towel so
it's like, hey, they're started for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're on a timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get them going now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we know you're going to grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could do that with the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand not everybody's able to grow
them right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you do have other things
lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand that you've got a grow
room plan, a grow room strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still it would be cool if you grew
that shit that we sent you for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is my pet peeve for
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to hear your grow room or
your cannabis community pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've seen something in a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've seen it on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've seen it at a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody says or does something that
just drives you crazy in our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good spot to air that grievance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that website, there is a top row of
tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One says grow help or grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that tab, that tab is
designed for you to be able to send me
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room questions and I can help you
with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need help, send them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is also the opportunity for you
to send me your grow room pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your pet peeve here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds on iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if I read those grow room questions
from the grow help tab, I will also send
[SPEAKER_00]: you a coupon code for a free pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do send me those grow room pet
peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you need help in the grow room,
send me those grow questions on that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if I read those questions or
pet peeves here on the air, you will get
[SPEAKER_00]: that coupon code for a free pack of
iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more piece of
business to cover before we jump into the
[SPEAKER_00]: email portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have noticed that for a short
while I was posting shorts on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you didn't notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't, go check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've posted a few shorts on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they are short clips taken from
long episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched some of the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a few key moments that I thought
would be notable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut them out and then I post them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I edit them up a little bit and then I
post them to YouTube as shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does a lot of advertising for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed I do get more subscribers and
more viewers because I post those shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have the time to make
those shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where I'm going to ask for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
cannabis community, my video editing
[SPEAKER_00]: friends out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching these podcasts and you
see key moments that you think could be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into useful shorts or useful clips
for social media, I would appreciate it if
[SPEAKER_00]: you clip those moments, edit them down to
they need to be between 30 and 55 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: long if I want to use them as shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're watching the show,
you see a notable moment clip that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a longer segment that you chop
down into 30 to 55 seconds so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But find that clip that you think is good
that may stand out, chop it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it into a 30 to 55 second clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to put a cool intro,
a cool outro on it or don't, I can add
[SPEAKER_00]: that if necessary on my own or I can use
it as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to put a filter or a texture
on it, that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your artistic creative thing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can send me one or two shorts
as an audition, I would truly appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if I like your style, maybe we can
work something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like to do honestly is trade
you a few packs of seeds for a few shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could send me a few now,
a few in the future, and then I'll send
[SPEAKER_00]: you a few seeds now, a few seeds in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep it like a continuous trade
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're always stacked up with new
seeds and then I've always got new shorts
[SPEAKER_00]: to post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I simply don't have time to
re-watch the podcast, pull the shorts out,
[SPEAKER_00]: edit them back down and then post them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody out there would like to make
those short clips for me, I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: trade you seeds or we could work out some
sort of other compensation for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, what I need is a short clip
somewhere between 30 and 55 seconds long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do your artistic creativity to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a long clip that's a three
minute ramble and you can cut it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: make it 30 to 55 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need is things that will draw
people into the podcast to get people
[SPEAKER_00]: watching, get people's attention in that
quick short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted that ramble to be much shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went way too long on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to wrap that up and say,
I look forward to your response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to reach out to me is use my
email address, growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we covered all of the business
at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to work into the email
section of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a bunch of great emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I mentioned that grow help tab
on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, iregenetics.com
on the top, there's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it says grow questions or grow help,
click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a grow question, please do
send me your grow question through that
[SPEAKER_00]: tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the show,
you will win a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds on ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first question did not come from the
grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talked about this a little bit on
my Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was intrigued by this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I would address this here on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend who wants to
be known as Brian420PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message,
Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one showed up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, it's so great for us consumers to
hear from a breeder directly like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do realize that that does help me out a
lot in this community, in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the breeders will sell you a pack
of seeds, and once you've got their money,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the end of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't respond to your emails,
your messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no show where you can find them,
no Discord where you can conversate with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take your money, and they salute you
if you get that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mail you a package, and it's all over
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in being part of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the product I sell you
should be of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be satisfied with what you get,
and I feel no need to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm sending you a good
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of my people tell me what a good
product they get from me, and if anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: does have a problem, I'm quick to correct
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said I love the transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got nothing to hide, and I feel like
it means a lot to the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hyri army.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a problem with the package
of seeds, or even just a grow question,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a lot of messages, so sometimes
everybody's message does not get answered
[SPEAKER_00]: promptly, but I try to answer most of the
messages I receive, and I'm on Discord way
[SPEAKER_00]: more than I should admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you really have a question,
a problem, a concern, you can find me on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not there, I'll be there soon,
and we can talk about whatever is going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we need to, we could break off into a
private chat and talk about it there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but thank you for noticing the
transparency, and it does make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice it makes a big difference in the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to events, I notice the few
breeders, there are other breeders that
[SPEAKER_00]: put their faces out there, and shout out
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks, the guys, the gals,
they put their faces out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones at the events that have
large booths, that have more people at
[SPEAKER_00]: their table, that have more traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that keep their head down,
and they don't put their faces out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't answer messages,
you can see at the events, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: At their booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thanks for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, based on only customer feedback
in the last year, which of your strains
[SPEAKER_00]: collected the most positive sentiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that was a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did also talk about this on my Instagram
live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not following me on Instagram,
I'm Iri Underscore Genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of fake accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one with 35 point something
thousand followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The others have like hundreds of
followers, so don't be duped, but this did
[SPEAKER_00]: come through on my Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Monday night, I do a live show at 7
10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time on every Monday on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, find my Instagram, Iri Genetics,
Monday, 7 10 Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for me to go live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be up there on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch me do a live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me questions, interact,
and hang out, and then after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I go play on Discord as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Mondays are busy, but this came up on
the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recall the answer that I gave on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have said blueberry butcher,
but after the Instagram live, show I took
[SPEAKER_00]: a moment and I went and looked and kind of
read some messages and scrolled through
[SPEAKER_00]: some things and looked at some customer
service emails and some reviews,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't remember the answer I for sure
gave on Instagram, but after thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and looking into it a little bit,
the strain that got the most positive
[SPEAKER_00]: sentiment, the most accolades,
the most notable strain from my lineup
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, that's harder to say than it
looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it was a tie between the
orangegasm and the blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm has been my most popular strain
for two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sells very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of great customer feedback
from the orangegasm, but recently I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed the blueberry butcher may be
passing that one up in popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also newer, so it's got more hype
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really having great success
with that blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got tremendous potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes all kinds of amazing extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it with BHO, if you're
doing it with water, if you're pressing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, the concentrates come out really well
from that blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a tie between that
orangegasm and the blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in third place, I know you only asked
for one, but it's my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can ramble if I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third place winner in that competition
would be the lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: My number three most notable strains,
it's going to be a tie between orangegasm
[SPEAKER_00]: and blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, number three, or maybe that's
number two, is the lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top three, orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry butcher and lemon jeffery are
the three that are getting the most
[SPEAKER_00]: notoriety now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that will shift because I put out a
lot of new stuff recently and people just
[SPEAKER_00]: simply have not had time to grow all of it
and send back a bunch of great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new stuff coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new stuff in testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new stuff that's recently been
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are growing that and there will
be new feedback on that within the next
[SPEAKER_00]: three, six, nine, twelve months,
especially over the next 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those reports will start coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see a big shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to add on to this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the strains that got the
most positive sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to talk about the strain of the
year for 2003 that I feel like got
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a lot of great strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send them out to friends to grow them
and then we put them online for other
[SPEAKER_00]: people to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what you guys are growing because
you post your pictures on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send me pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You share the photos on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please join the discord server and post
your pictures of my lines over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from all the reasons and results that
I've seen, I think people are really
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeping on the red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red line is an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces gigantic flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got amazing aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a concentrate maker,
red line is made from red Lebanese hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a hash plant derivative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red line is very overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it would have sold more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it would have been more sought
after and more hyped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people kind of seem to be sleeping on
the red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my top three best sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red line is the one that got
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, I think previously in the
previous years, scarlet begonias was the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that got snubbed and overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those strains, the red line and
the scarlet begonias are hot fire and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just didn't get a notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I wonder if it was my marketing,
if it was timing, if it was the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's the strain name that
does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People weren't into the strain scarlet
begonias for some reason, but I wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: what does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I know what's gonna make a
strain stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photos are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I put up red line right next to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a cool name, red line,
because when you smoke it, your eyes get
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that's as high as you're gonna
get your red lining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I used to ride bikes when I
was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a tribute to the red line
bicycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rode GTs, but red lines were around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the red line, one of the most
overlooked plants in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really was funny that happened though
is scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do still have some scarlet begonia
seeds, very few.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to package them up, get them on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are almost gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I thought was funny is when I was
almost out of scarlet begonia seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain got real popular and people
wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that it's gone, I don't make it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's hyped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what will happen to the
red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Brian, 4.20 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do owe you a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This did not come through the proper
avenue, but it was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me a lot of good rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brian, 4.20 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't fake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell me you're Brian if you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message or a comment on YouTube
with your email address or with a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in touch with you, because I would
like to send you a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds at irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this party moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another great question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one did come from the Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody who wants to
be called Soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Soda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this Soda from Discord?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's not Soda from Discord,
you should join the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you will be the other Soda on
Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I did so that I could tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this question is a general Grow
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm just wondering about federal
rescheduling or descheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a lot of talk lately about
the DEA rescheduling or rescheduling or
[SPEAKER_00]: descheduling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no true info out yet at the time
of this recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you think breeders will be
able or even want to send out flower
[SPEAKER_00]: tester packs before folks decide which
seeds to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a pretty cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He clears it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, what I mean by that is maybe a
couple of nugs or pre-rolls of each flower
[SPEAKER_00]: product so you know which seeds to buy
based off the effects you get when you try
[SPEAKER_00]: a test sampler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like a sampler at a
microbrewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just seeing myself walking
around Costco getting little samples as
[SPEAKER_00]: you said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, this would be just an additional
product people could purchase if they
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is a really cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some pros and cons to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may set a really weird expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grew a bunch of, let's just say pick
a strain, what's coming out real soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say light ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light ripper is coming soon you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: P91 to Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light ripper is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be released very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out iREDirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign up for the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But light ripper is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say I wanted to advertise light
ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew whatever, a whole bunch of light
ripper and I rolled up or just divided up
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I took a pound and I gave you a
whole bunch of grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it all in grams and then people
that were tempted to buy the seeds could
[SPEAKER_00]: order a sample for whatever a gram would
cost and then we could hypothetically send
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I would have light ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I would also have, what else is
something that's going to come out soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give you guys too many
tinfoil hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I got some tinfoil hat packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I got some paradiddle packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe I got the weed also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I could send you a paradiddle
gram, a tinfoil hat gram, a light ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get all those and you can
smoke those and then you can decide which
[SPEAKER_00]: strain you want to buy those seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing weed for a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown cannabis in basements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown cannabis in attics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown cannabis in rooms that have
been built under stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also grown cannabis in giant
commercial production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in all different types of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also bred this product that we are
sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be able to grow this like a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be able to grow the shit out of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be award-winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may be setting an unrealistic
expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grow it and I send it to you and you
choose from those three, maybe I chose a
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotype than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I had better lighting than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I had better nutrients than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've just simply got more experience
and you're going to make your selection
[SPEAKER_00]: based off of my grow, which that's cool,
but your grow won't be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it won't come out the same for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying as the breeder,
I like the idea, but I'm also sketched out
[SPEAKER_00]: by the idea for a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I think the descriptions
and the genetics give people a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of why they want a strain and why
they want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really cool hypothetical idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cool fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cool what if.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of things to think about
that come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I wrote down is, bro,
that's what the events are for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like the Dude Grows Cup,
the Groovy Gravy Event, the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the other big consumption events or
the big community events where you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're allowed to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeders, the growers, we try to bring
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the venues tell us we can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to sneak them in anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we do what we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we simply don't have samples
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're between crops or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we like to do is bring a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going to the Dude Grows Cup,
I want to sell you a bunch of orangegasm
[SPEAKER_00]: or lemon jeffery seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't I grow a whole bunch of
orangegasm or lemon jeffery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jar it up and bring it with me to the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it sitting on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when you're like, okay,
I'm thinking about buying orangegasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be like, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell it and you can go, holy shit,
I have to buy two packs of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the events is where that is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also what's beautiful about the events,
you can find five, six, 10 or 20 people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are growing iry genetic strains and
you can sample from different people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have grown it in different environments,
different conditions with different
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, different nutrients, different,
completely different methods altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is mixed, cocoa, hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you can grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to come up some smart ass
way, but we'll stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people are growing it from California
to Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got people in Maine where it's snowing
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got people in Arizona where it's hot
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's growing it in different
environments and conditions and we all
[SPEAKER_00]: meet up at the Dude Grows Cup and you can
say, hey, this guy grew Raphael in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy grew Raphael in Missouri and you
can see both of their samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy grew orangegasm in Colorado
and this guy grew orangegasm in Maine and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can look at both of our samples and
you can see kind of a variety of what iry
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics has to offer by coming to the
events with the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do you get to come see the
product, smoke the product, you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to meet the iry army, all the
people you've been talking to on the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll also get an opportunity to
meet Mike and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are stuck behind the booth most of the
time because we've got work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But come up to the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy anything to come to
my booth and say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not busy, if there's not a long
line, there's points in the day where the
[SPEAKER_00]: booth gets really dead and really slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's not a wave, if you just want
to come bullshit, come bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we are there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a hug if that's what you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke some of the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet the community and say hi to us is
what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm rambling once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what I smoked,
bro, but it was fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this would be a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool if I could send you out some
samples like every few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be like, hey, here's five different
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what seed pack you're into and
we can get you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is really what the community
events are for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out there, join the community,
move around and go to as many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: events as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of events coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsored by any of the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsoring any of the events,
but there's the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is rumored to be a Groovy Gravy
Secret Stash coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two different booth crew meetups
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Hoco does his meetup every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of other random cups all
throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a part of that community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet more people and then find out where
the next event is going to be in your
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start branching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start traveling around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to more of the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet more of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank you once again for
listening to another short episode of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to keep them short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice you guys watch all the way to the
end if they are shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want longer episodes, argue in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see what I can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you once again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns, I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you do have a pet peeve or a
grow room question, use that Grow Help tab
[SPEAKER_00]: on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you could possibly need is on
that website iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link to the Patreon server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link to the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link to the website to get the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you can imagine is at
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've listened this far,
make sure you use coupon code love for 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: off at iredirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're shopping at iredirect,
use coupon code love to save 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm doing a sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm recording this episode,
I'm doing a sale on iredirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing an inventory reduction blowout
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to count all the inventory on
iredirect, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier if there's no inventory to
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to blow it out at crazy
prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will come out probably during the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may still be some stuff left that
coupon code love will still apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other coupon codes you have will
still apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go hit iredirect and grab the packs
you've been thinking about getting while
[SPEAKER_00]: they are still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once these seeds all do blowout,
we will do an inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do a fresh restock and some new
drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want some packs at a blowout
price, now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in one week with fresh new
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my
little brother, Hawaiian Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big up yourself every time, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to take another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your piece and a nugget by the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit back, Pokemon, be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aura.
Rasta Jeff.
Rasta Jeff.
Rasta Jeff.
