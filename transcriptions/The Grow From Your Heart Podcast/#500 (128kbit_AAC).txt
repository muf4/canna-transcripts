while, but you've been listening Do you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys have any we'll start with Mike since
he's we're gonna go in a circle Do you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys have any favorite episode or favorite
moments out of 500 episodes?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the the centennial episodes the 100
I think was like 102.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we do it too?
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe did a 250 know me 100 and 400
I think were my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay when we get like Spencer and the big
crew here When we had the the big table
[SPEAKER_05]: for 100 was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the big table and the little table
There used to be another table over there
[SPEAKER_02]: two tables for that one Yeah, when sloppy
took a dab out of the rig with no water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a good podcast Dry dab and
then my microphone dab where that's funny
[SPEAKER_02]: that you say that bro That's a great segue
because I wrote down a favorite moment of
[SPEAKER_02]: each of you guys and it says Mike smoked
the microphone That's my one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite moments of being on the show with
you imagine and I'm gonna give these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: here on the show a visual a visual imagine
if I had the dab rig like this and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: this rig and Mike put the dab into the
banger like he was gonna make it work,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he put his mouth on the microphone
Like he tried to smoke through the
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone and fucking took it like a
champ I laugh like a champ I hit it until
[SPEAKER_05]: my eyes registered that the rig wasn't
responding correctly to my inhalation
[SPEAKER_05]: Something's wrong because I'm sucking and
there's no bubbles or oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a microphone not a mouthpiece These
mics in front of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not natural Like if you don't do
this, this is you're not used to having
[SPEAKER_02]: this big thing here So it was totally
funny to me and I really laughed at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very everyone's adjusting their
mics now since I said that that's funny
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna be more conscious of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a podcast get stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun Matt you're new to the show,
bro You're kind of one of the new homies,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why I wanted to bring you we've
got Mike who's been here since Basically
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning we got Clint who came around
around the middle and then you're brand
[SPEAKER_02]: new.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cool to have That's why I wanted
this little spectrum of folks here and
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse was invited but could not make it
Jesse's working hard on the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did send a message to somebody else
didn't hear a reply So shout out to
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to get you guys, but we don't got
no more room anyway So let's hear your
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe one of your favorite or most
memorable moments from the show,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm honestly I binge watch your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all kind of blend together nice a
lot of times And that's how content is
[SPEAKER_01]: taken nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just watch seven episodes all day,
you know, I Enjoy it all man from the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge just to even hearing about your
strains and your crosses because you know
[SPEAKER_01]: as a Grower myself, you know, I'm always
interested in what's coming out new nice
[SPEAKER_02]: my memorable moment Well, I've had you on
the show recently Was watching it fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: stoned and then try to get your shit
together for the show I didn't realize how
[SPEAKER_02]: stoned you were before we recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And then we're right when I hear
because it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happens people think I'm fine
I'm fine and everybody thinks I'm fine and
[SPEAKER_02]: you put a microphone in front of people
that don't broadcast or record or do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything and they suddenly go I'm not
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man You get twice as or three times
or four times as high and I didn't realize
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd done that to you So I had to kind of
kind of ease you into it, but I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: that and I thought it was great I don't
mind that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when people are you become more I
wouldn't have been the first guest to need
[SPEAKER_05]: a nap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man It's funny Jesse didn't show up
but then memorable one of my most
[SPEAKER_02]: memorable moments for Jesse was in the
middle of a pile He gave me the the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking across-the-throat thing of like
cut cut cut And so I just finished up my
[SPEAKER_02]: sentence pressed pause and he stood up and
went late on that couch over there Didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: say much for like an hour I think I gave
him some cookies and a bottle of water and
[SPEAKER_02]: he just laid over there on the couch That
was my memorable moment for Jesse for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I do have a tendency to kind of
wreck people It's this dab rig and these
[SPEAKER_02]: good concentrates in this environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone feels so comfortable here that
they're like fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's smoke yeah, I've never heard such a
Unlistenable version of what cookies and
[SPEAKER_01]: cream was Jesus Christ Man, I went back
and listen to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, holy fuck dude, like yeah No,
we dab out hard and I think for Jeff to
[SPEAKER_01]: put out as great content as he does and
hit that rig like he does this fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible Man's a train I'll agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a compliment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's not exaggerating I we took a
few extra minutes to start the show
[SPEAKER_02]: because I took probably three or four
extra dabs that these guys were not
[SPEAKER_02]: Involved in the mic went to go have a
cigarette and I was like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: here we go then And to just make sure that
I was well-prepared and yeah had to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more baked now They're still
passing around this bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, the ball doesn't make the torch
sound so it gets a little more longer in
[SPEAKER_02]: the show Clint you look like you're eager
to tell me your most memorable moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am dude episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear about it, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I was growing those plants I was growing
I had six hemp plants that I was growing
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'd been working on that farm and
So I was finishing up those and going
[SPEAKER_04]: through your drying and curing Tutorials
was what made it to where I actually like
[SPEAKER_04]: oh nice have decent non moldy Like not I
didn't need them to be like super moist or
[SPEAKER_04]: anything because it's hemp and I'm gonna
grind it all down anyway But there was
[SPEAKER_04]: just some key things that you you know,
hang it upside down for like a week in a
[SPEAKER_04]: 50% humidity Here's how you do that and
just things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my favorite because I I would go
back And listen to that over and over and
[SPEAKER_04]: that really helped me a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if I ever told you that
Yeah, well, that's that's spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you, man And I'm proud of you
because you've brought over you brought
[SPEAKER_02]: over some weed that you grew your first
batch and it was you know It looked like
[SPEAKER_02]: some weed that you grew and I can tell
some outdoor that you kind of you know You
[SPEAKER_02]: grew some weed and then you brought over
that branch recently and you're like this
[SPEAKER_02]: got broken off a plant I dried and cured
and trimmed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a tremendous difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was way better I even smoked it and
complimented it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I've seen evolution in Excuse the
throat learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen evolution in your cannabis
growth You're better now than you were
[SPEAKER_02]: when I first when you first started
growing you didn't even smoke when I first
[SPEAKER_02]: met you So you've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude I I knew you right before the
podcast started Wow, cuz you started a
[SPEAKER_04]: different podcast and that's how we met.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep I've been listening for a long time,
but I was really able to hone in on some
[SPEAKER_04]: skills Like like you said like having the
experience of having done it once too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like okay, I really should have stopped
here I should have stopped drying here
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, instead of giving it that extra day
or two days, you know, and it was just an
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor grow You know, it's I first grow
and it's I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm addicted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super fun I know a lot of people that
after one or two they're like no,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is like my new thing now I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see it old-school growers used to say
the most addicting thing about cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: growing cannabis Yeah, I think that's an
Ed Rosenthal shirt in it could be but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it to be very accurate I love my
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a relationship with them I was
talking on another podcast about what I
[SPEAKER_02]: call the growers gaze when I'm done in my
grow room if it's my small 5 by 5 space if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a 10 by 10 space or if it's a giant
commercial facility when I'm done with the
[SPEAKER_02]: work as I Sweep the floor toward the
doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gather all the trash toward the door I
set everything outside of the door and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I just stare into the room and it's
just this growers gaze I'm just first of
[SPEAKER_02]: all, I'm looking at my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm marveling and look I did that that's
what we did that if it's a team like we
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplished that those are Living
organisms that we've kept alive for a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keeping shit alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's impressive in its own You know
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we should be playing Xbox and
fucking high-fiving each other But we're
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping gardens million-dollar gardens
alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I marvel at my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stare at this work I go wow,
it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also I'm just feeling the energy
from those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're giving me a vibe They're saying
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for making us look so good You
just defoliated me and you cut off all
[SPEAKER_02]: that bottom shit and I could grow and look
out man I'm flexing they look like they
[SPEAKER_02]: just got their hair done.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look look how pretty I am I look So
fucking good and then also that's when I
[SPEAKER_02]: notice the issues when I'm doing that
growers gaze just that stare That's when I
[SPEAKER_02]: hear like oh that air conditioner is going
tink tink tink tink because now I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about defoliating or sweeping I
don't have Joe Rogan in my ear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just I forgot I've lost my fucking
total train of thought but now you just
[SPEAKER_04]: get honed in on the plant It's really nice
to have like these goals and like you like
[SPEAKER_04]: being able to breed things like this and
with your feno hunting and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm excited to move on to like maybe
something, you know actually grow one Of
[SPEAKER_04]: your strains this year whenever you're
exciting whenever you are ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta figure that out So we'll see we'll
see where the where the tent can go up and
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll go from there can't wait All right
The next thing that I had written down
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wanted to talk about was did we
learn anything in 500 episodes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like Clint has been learning his
ass off for the past 500 episodes Like
[SPEAKER_02]: you've learned how to dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the most valuable thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it probably the drying and curing that
you've learned?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that I would have to say that
because the the grow knowledge,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know through veg at least Is pretty
pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they grow you feed them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing You put them in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, don't leave them in those
black five gallons either, but you know
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm learning But I mean there's just so
much to learn about the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think I Don't know man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I think the most thing is you said to
read books Yeah, and so that helped me a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I got that Rosenthal's and then I You
know just being able to go on the internet
[SPEAKER_04]: and actually like find a credible source.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not hard anymore Yeah, all of the
books I recommend are available on a PDF
[SPEAKER_02]: form on the internet for free Yeah,
we're all taking a poop at some point in
[SPEAKER_02]: our life and we probably scroll Facebook
So just type in the name of a book and do
[SPEAKER_05]: that instead But there's totally a reason
humans been playing with this plant since
[SPEAKER_05]: we found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it's marvelous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it There's not one group of people
on the planet that ran into cannabis me
[SPEAKER_02]: back around to the thought that I lost
That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were saying that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more addicted To growing it then
smoking it and that's why I get that
[SPEAKER_02]: growers gaze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just beautiful I'm just staring at it
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's an accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited that you have learned so much
It's good seeing one of my bros go from
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of interested in smoking hanging out
with a bunch of stoners like I smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: occasionally and then you got a job at a
hemp farm and then you learned a lot about
[SPEAKER_02]: it and now you've actually produced your
own cannabis that you're able to enjoy so
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've come a long way not just as a
stoner I love that you're on our team now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I love that you're growing and that
you know how to do it You can teach other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's and now that's another more
people will learn how to grow like in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future because of that So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of my goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a lot to learn before I think I can
teach anybody But I do feel what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move to the left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Double door dank What have you learned
in 500 episodes at this show brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man I've learned a lot honestly
environmental control With you has been
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the key thing that I've focused
in on Really listening to your episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of Makes me, you know go back and
question like, you know, what is my VPD?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know making sure that I am
consistent with you know the room's
[SPEAKER_01]: environment all throughout not just in one
section and trying to you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just dial everything in you know,
and I like the episode where you Describe
[SPEAKER_01]: dialing in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hearing that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cracker Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: He tilts your head like you're ready Oh,
there's so much that we've learned over
[SPEAKER_05]: 500 episodes, dude like from how to record
a good podcast to sound editing to which
[SPEAKER_05]: pieces equipment or pieces of shit to I
mean all the different grow knowledge that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've specifically researched so you can
do those episodes like There's a lot we've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned here You've taught us a lot bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've taught people how to be active and
how to I've learned how to be more
[SPEAKER_05]: effective Just trying different shit at
council like I'm trying to think back to
[SPEAKER_05]: like episode one through ten like what
else was going on then and Like I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: think Pueblo had regulations for legal
cannabis yet I think we're still bitching
[SPEAKER_05]: about them or just getting started into
hammering those out and We've gone full
[SPEAKER_05]: circle, but now we're reviewing all of
those now It's been a long strange trip
[SPEAKER_05]: brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a fun evolution The birthday of
the show is coming up in March or April.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have a birthday show here coming
pretty soon What did the hash look like
[SPEAKER_05]: for episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the hash for episode one was dark
shitty shatter and was it black and a
[SPEAKER_05]: co-file was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was we were past that I think it was
crappy shatter at that crappy shatter
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I remember doing like the two
gram shatter dabs and stuff back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't you miss the titanium nail days?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shatter and I just found one going through
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This show used to be sponsored by highly
educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: No kidding Yeah shot at the task and
highly educated he's gone for making
[SPEAKER_02]: titanium now We make some of the best
quartz bangers on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: He calls him the gavel pretty Nice fucking
piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah shot at the task rock, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned a lot I guess I should talk
about stuff that I have learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh I never told us about my favorite
moment of Clint one time I was starting a
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast episode and I used to start with
music and I would go Yeah, welcome back
[SPEAKER_02]: pot and as soon as I took a breath to go,
yeah Clint beat me to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was yeah Like way different than I do
it like he came he like totally tried to
[SPEAKER_02]: opposite I could see him like timing it
and shit and I was like he's gonna do any
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of Yeah, just like off it didn't
even sound good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like that was there's a
beautiful crash Those are my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: moments of you most easily remembered
moments of you Yeah, yeah, I try not to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've grown out of that, but it was fun It
was highly acceptable that time people
[SPEAKER_02]: loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The listeners loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, people are fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun podcast What's the point if
we're not having fun?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was a I love learning but I hated
school and sitting there and feeling like
[SPEAKER_02]: I was being lectured if they would have
made school fun I'd have like a quadruple
[SPEAKER_02]: major, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would do that, but it was boring I
don't want to sit there and get lectured
[SPEAKER_02]: and shit I want to put my hands on stuff
and see what happens if I do it wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, like that's so yeah You're
gonna teach in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna talk about the things that I've
learned like Mike said I've learned how to
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast I've learned when to quit rambling
about something that doesn't matter almost
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've learned a lot about growing I
have changed a lot of my approaches to a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of things and I've learned that it's
okay if you want to grow and evolve it is
[SPEAKER_02]: okay to change your ideas and your
approach and your Direction if you learn
[SPEAKER_02]: something new that could disrupt your
entire schedule your entire plan But if it
[SPEAKER_02]: improves something and if you knew you
were making a mistake or if you can
[SPEAKER_02]: Compound on something and make it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not change?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had to fucking change on the fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned to just adjust and grow I've
learned a lot of shit over the past few
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned to say Oh, yeah, that was my
old way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I do it now I may have been
wrong before and I'm comfortable with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have to we know everybody's got
to evolve man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've gone from in my grow ever
evolution I went from a Three-by-three
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that I went from a computer box lined
with foil basically was my first real
[SPEAKER_02]: attempt at growing I got a computer box
and put foil in it and put yeah dudes does
[SPEAKER_02]: whack but it made weed but then I got a
three-by-three tent and then I got a 11 by
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 room and then I had an 11 by 14 room
and like some more rooms and then I had
[SPEAKER_02]: like a couple of 8 by 8 tents and then it
just started getting crazy and then now I
[SPEAKER_02]: run facilities that have a thousand lights
completely in the whole facility and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: have learned a lot and if you listen to
the show you've heard my evolution like
[SPEAKER_02]: you've paid attention and seen my growth
and go from this is how we would do a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of plants to this is how we do
fucking seven thousand plants in one day
[SPEAKER_02]: with the crew of six like yeah I figured
out I've learned a lot of stuff and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned how to cut out a lot of crappy
steps and learned what is learned to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of filter out what's not necessary and
what we do really need to do because once
[SPEAKER_02]: you get to a commercial grow like Matt's
got a big experience in a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_02]: you cut out a lot of the crap and then you
take that to your home grow and your home
[SPEAKER_01]: grow just flourishes oh yeah I think
learning how to keep a healthy veg and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep cycles going perpetual on a
commercial scale is something it's
[SPEAKER_01]: invaluable to a grower especially at your
home yeah because you take that knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: and really veg is the point where you're
gonna have either success or failure
[SPEAKER_02]: scheduling problems and yeah powerful
plants healthy happy plants it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: rhythm that varies plant to plant and
strain to strain so like you really have
[SPEAKER_05]: to be in tune with it to do it right and
I've seen it done well and I've seen it
[SPEAKER_05]: done not well thank you yeah it's funny
you mentioned when everything's home and
[SPEAKER_05]: it is so much fun it doesn't matter if
it's one plant or six plants or 16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: plants when it's going well it is so much
fun yeah it's funny you mentioned the
[SPEAKER_01]: little foil line box or whatever I
remember being like 12 and finding one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those at my uncle's house and be like what
the hell is this why is this shiny and
[SPEAKER_01]: lights in here this is great and he's like
I'll leave that alone that's for taking
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures that's my photography box yeah
yeah you know right all right so I asked a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of great questions I got my my
guests interacted and involved I've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of emails that I think would be
very appropriate for this episode of the
[SPEAKER_02]: show first I want to read this one just
because it's kind of funny and you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are Pueblo folk this one says dear Rasta
Jeff please don't use my real name if you
[SPEAKER_02]: need a name you can call me used to be
cool because I used to be cool when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: young and they spell it EUSTA middle
initial B last name cool used to be cool
[SPEAKER_02]: man you're still fucking cool you're
calling yourself used to be cool you're
[SPEAKER_02]: still stylish I'm 40 and still kicking ass
there's no reason why you can't since I
[SPEAKER_02]: came across your podcast after I saw you
on the dude grow show well your shows are
[SPEAKER_02]: both entertaining and informative I try
not to miss a single one I was drawn to
[SPEAKER_02]: your story because my wife has suffered
two major life-threatening head injuries
[SPEAKER_02]: during our 40 years of marriage I'm sorry
to hear about your wife and congrats on 40
[SPEAKER_02]: years while she has mostly recovered good
to hear life changed for her and everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: around her yes a brain injury will make
shit different the process of thinking is
[SPEAKER_02]: both complex and amazing she is one of the
nicest and a most and amazing people I
[SPEAKER_02]: have ever met and I am truly grateful to
still have her in my life but that is not
[SPEAKER_02]: why I write all right so here is why this
person writes this he says now here you
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about Pueblo and how cannabis has
changed it for the better yes we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about that a lot this used to be kind of a
little a different place and now it's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of lively up we're getting better food a
better environment because of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry I believe this person says in the
80s we lived in a small Kansas town and
[SPEAKER_02]: our trips from the mountains took us
through Pueblo it was in the mid 80s on a
[SPEAKER_02]: return from camping that we had one of the
nicest things anyone has ever done for me
[SPEAKER_02]: while traveling happen in Pueblo as we
were approaching Pueblo from the north we
[SPEAKER_02]: could see a massive thunderstorm over
Pueblo very common here right we get some
[SPEAKER_02]: killer thunderstorms here in the late
summer I was one of those scary purple and
[SPEAKER_02]: green cloud storms when we got into town
traffic came to a standstill due to
[SPEAKER_02]: serious flooding my memory is a little
fuzzy on this detail but it might have
[SPEAKER_02]: been where a railroad bridge crossed over
the highway and the road dropped down as
[SPEAKER_02]: it went under a bridge that part made me
laugh everybody yeah took a breath because
[SPEAKER_02]: they all want to say where it is where is
that boys I think that was 29th Street
[SPEAKER_02]: 29th Street under the highway where the
railroad bridge is this person was right
[SPEAKER_02]: up by the mall used to be really really
bad it still is on the north edge highway
[SPEAKER_02]: exits yep yeah soon if you get rain and
you're on that side of town everybody just
[SPEAKER_02]: scatters they're like nope do not want to
be over on this part of town Matt's new
[SPEAKER_01]: here and he knew what we were talking
about immediately and there's a spot on
[SPEAKER_01]: exit one away too if you're coming from
the freeway it dips down really oh yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that spot'll flood out yeah well
that's new though I don't think that was
[SPEAKER_04]: there in the fucking 80s that didn't exist
well it's nice that they remember
[SPEAKER_02]: something that still is a tradition for us
right yeah yeah but you see it on the news
[SPEAKER_02]: every couple of years that intersection
floods twice a summer yeah the cars will
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking float away in that intersection
but there is an upside to this message and
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was really funny cuz I knew
everybody in the room would know exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: when I said where the highway dips and
there was water you're like yeah fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: north side thanks for the memories then it
goes on to say as we were approaching
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo from the north oh no where am I I'm
lost now let's see let's see I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: catch up okay as we sat in the traffic jam
for nearly an hour with no sign that the
[SPEAKER_02]: street would ever clear anytime soon then
I noticed a woman about my wife's age
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting next to us in a pickup she noticed
me and she and we shared a smile she also
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed our young children sitting in a
backseat people began breaking off from
[SPEAKER_02]: the standstill to find alternate routes I
think she must have seen my gears in my
[SPEAKER_02]: head turning because she hollered at me
she told us pull in behind me and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: take you a safe way through town because
she did not want us going the dangerous
[SPEAKER_02]: way through town she led us all the way
through town safely through Pueblo neither
[SPEAKER_02]: my wife nor I have forgotten that simple
act of kindness so if you read this on the
[SPEAKER_02]: air I hope that woman is listening so she
will know how much she helped and how much
[SPEAKER_02]: we appreciate it keep up the good work
Ross to Jeff and keep making Pueblo a
[SPEAKER_02]: better place is there anything cannabis
can't do signed used to be cool that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: cool fucking message I thought we would
all laugh about them being stuck and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they got a nice person to guide them
through town I don't know which way they
[SPEAKER_02]: took them probably down Elizabeth but
depends on where they were headed all
[SPEAKER_02]: right shout out to used to be cool I
thought that was funny since we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: here sitting at the table god damn you
Clint and I love a good positive Pueblo
[SPEAKER_05]: story because someone so many of them
don't take that twist in the middle yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah I expected she got like let off by
that lady and then went to the bad side of
[SPEAKER_02]: town she led us to a part of town where
there were a bunch of bunch of fucking car
[SPEAKER_02]: dumps and a bunch of landfills and we've
never seen our vehicle or children since
[SPEAKER_02]: and when we came out of the restaurant the
car was on blocks some Pueblo stories go
[SPEAKER_02]: all right I do have another email from
somebody this is Dan the indoor man they
[SPEAKER_02]: show us a lot of support Dan what up Dan
the indoor man it goes like this it says
[SPEAKER_02]: hey bro it's dick Dan if you read this on
the air damn name is dick Dan all right
[SPEAKER_02]: what's up that's awkward I have to tell
you how much you have helped me through my
[SPEAKER_02]: grows and my life you're an inspiration to
all of us well thanks dick Dan then it
[SPEAKER_02]: says but hearing the tune at each of your
podcasts is something I love and wait to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear for the 500th episode I thought it
would be cool if you could create a
[SPEAKER_02]: playlist and explain why these tunes
matter to you you mentioned that your
[SPEAKER_02]: uncle loved Metallica and it influenced
you and I'd love to hear more about the
[SPEAKER_02]: influences on your life not only is your
grow knowledge top-notch but your musical
[SPEAKER_02]: choice is stunning see my music choices I
might just rolled his eyes I could see him
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the corner of my eye he disagrees
but that's all right that's all right he
[SPEAKER_02]: listens to 311 so we're gonna be okay this
is and as I said through the year I gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: go set it see 500 you could make it about
music I also have to tell you the last
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast with Clint and finding your weak
nesses and bettering yourself has given me
[SPEAKER_02]: a message I had kind of ignored there we
go food for thought much love and ultimate
[SPEAKER_02]: respect signed dick Dan big shout out to
dick Dan I don't want to dedicate an
[SPEAKER_02]: entire episode to talking about the music
that I enjoy but I've got a good group of
[SPEAKER_02]: friends here that have similar yet
different musical interests Matt and I
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about music as he plays Mike and I
have hung out for a long time so we have
[SPEAKER_02]: suffered each other's music quite a bit
and Mike and our Clint and I kind of match
[SPEAKER_02]: up kind of don't match up on some the
middle of our music lines up the outer
[SPEAKER_02]: edges are way different in our musical
likes yeah we're kind of opposites I'd say
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah there's not a whole lot that I think
we would both be like oh yeah this is all
[SPEAKER_02]: right let's put you on the spot then if
you are what do you like to listen to when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're good and baked if you just had to
pick some music if you you're gonna man
[SPEAKER_02]: this is allegedly if you're gonna get
stoned and drive home in this fucking nice
[SPEAKER_02]: day and you're just cruising and I you
know the fucking drive when it feels good
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're stoned and got the music on
what song are you putting on probably put
[SPEAKER_04]: on like go Jerry
[SPEAKER_04]: they're a French metal band they're
they're just brutal it's it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: really good though it's like I've actually

[SPEAKER_02]: the name of them and I googled it they're
good brother music is good it's heavy I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: a drummer and I am melodic too it's not
like screamy I don't know it's in there
[SPEAKER_04]: screaming about like fixing world issues
like global warming and like endangered
[SPEAKER_04]: species and stuff they're not cursing it's
all in English I'm really like putting
[SPEAKER_04]: this band over because I like them a lot I

[SPEAKER_04]: choice is the Gojira do you have a backup
last night I got my record player put up
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was listening to uh damn I can never
remember that dude's name I'm sorry man
[SPEAKER_02]: that's all right is there a song or
something from back in the day that when
[SPEAKER_02]: you smoke and you hear that song it just
gives you that like huh you just get a
[SPEAKER_04]: feels for for memories from back in the
day yeah yeah you know I was such a dork
[SPEAKER_04]: for like country back in the day so I can
listen to some George Strait and really
[SPEAKER_04]: like get down on it all right especially
like you get a little bit of a broken
[SPEAKER_04]: heart and all of a sudden like country
boys are really speaking the gospel so
[SPEAKER_04]: like I don't know man I don't do much
drinking but it makes me want to like
[SPEAKER_04]: drink when you're listening to some of
those dudes trying to put it down so I
[SPEAKER_02]: just want to remind you you did make fun
of Mike for listening to 311 just a minute
[SPEAKER_02]: ago yeah I mean it's still justified you
guys are even now I'll take my lumps I
[SPEAKER_02]: understand you guys are even country 311

[SPEAKER_04]: each other now people are gonna be like
metal and country and I'm into that too so
[SPEAKER_02]: let me know at tall Clint man I can't hate
on anybody for their musical choices I've
[SPEAKER_02]: played music for more than half of my life
and I love did I I'm a drummer for hire if
[SPEAKER_02]: you need a drummer and you give me a
couple weeks notice and you give me the
[SPEAKER_02]: music tell me the songs I'll fucking learn
those songs I'll play them on stage it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be beautiful I have been treated with more
respect and paid more appropriately by
[SPEAKER_02]: country bands than any rock and roll or
blues band ever the country folks are very
[SPEAKER_02]: professional they're on time they speak
well they pay you well and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: respectful it's a business that is a
business to them the rock and roll bands
[SPEAKER_02]: it's 50-50 business 50-50 getting out away
from the family on Friday night yeah so
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah the country bands they pay well and I
know a lot of country music on the drums
[SPEAKER_02]: like yeah there was a band around here
that had a very lovely female country
[SPEAKER_02]: singer and they used to pay me very well
to be her drummer yeah so I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the lead the female lead vocalist country
type stuff got paid a lot of money to play
[SPEAKER_04]: it well I mean there's there's a lot of
money and entertainment yeah all of all
[SPEAKER_04]: factions that's it country's a big thing
it's crazy especially right here in this
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the country we got a really cool
musical opportunity you can be in a metal
[SPEAKER_02]: band one night in a country band the next
night the hip-hop band the next night here
[SPEAKER_02]: and ever the bar will be full all three
nights because we got such a diverse crowd
[SPEAKER_02]: here we really do yeah yeah all right I'm
gonna move over here to double door cuz
[SPEAKER_02]: he's not in his head you're excited bro
what do you like to listen to when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: good and stoned honestly dinner on an
unplugged album oh that's a good one
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking just listen to it that's good
you're too young for that bro that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I's age shit that's timeless dude
yeah that's true put it on just let it go
[SPEAKER_01]: man the whole album fucking just perfect
that makes me want to go grab my acoustic
[SPEAKER_02]: guitar because that's basically how myself
and a couple other friends learn to play
[SPEAKER_02]: guitar is through that album like we all
learned all those simple Nirvana licks
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah he just learned the fucking G's and
C's off of those songs and from there yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of Nirvana in a high school
and stuff on guitar and you know it just
[SPEAKER_02]: always stuck with me I was inspired to
play the drums by Lars a big big shout out
[SPEAKER_02]: to Neil Purt real quick by the way but I
was inspired to play the drums by Lars
[SPEAKER_02]: from Metallica and partly by my uncle
that's what inspired this question here
[SPEAKER_02]: but smells like teen spirit was the first
song I actually focused on learning on the
[SPEAKER_02]: drums and like accomplished and felt like
I can put that on in the headphones and
[SPEAKER_02]: play it and sound like I'm actually
playing with a band and smells like teen
[SPEAKER_02]: spirit was my first tune that I learned so
that was kind of cool oh yeah so Nirvana
[SPEAKER_02]: is what you want to put on when you're
stoned what's the fucking song or the
[SPEAKER_02]: album that gives you the feels brother
just makes you fucking get some some
[SPEAKER_01]: tingly spine feelings let's see where did
you sleep last night okay fucking great
[SPEAKER_01]: one wake a fire yeah man where did you
sleep last night just all Nirvana yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Nirvana well no I was in the metal for a
long time mostly like Pantera and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that which I'm you know like Cowboys
from Hell I really love the vulgar display
[SPEAKER_02]: of power album was really good I really
liked the what's after that the one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm broken's on there I can fucking see
the baby bloons got a screw in his head
[SPEAKER_02]: it's what's the name of that album dude
can't remember that when people are
[SPEAKER_02]: yelling it at their fucking phone right
now it's called this you asshole it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Pantera to the return to electric boogaloo
Pantera we have so many people so angry
[SPEAKER_01]: Vinny Paul's gonna kill us oh is he the
one with I'm broken on it oh is he right
[SPEAKER_02]: too soon
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking loved that one that was a good
one it was a little overproduced but after
[SPEAKER_02]: that I fell off the Pantera train they may
have also I'm not sure yeah but I don't I
[SPEAKER_02]: love some good Pantera they got that good
heavy feel good music yeah you'd think for
[SPEAKER_02]: a reggae fan and a fish kid and a Grateful
Dead fan I wouldn't know so much about
[SPEAKER_02]: Pantera and Metallica but that's where I
came from yeah yeah my uncle's put that
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking good metal vibe in my head I just
have to be sure I'm not driving when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to Pantera and shit like fucking
speeding tickets bro we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: it earlier fucking hey you put the right
song on man you're going fucking 20 over
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah I think Mike and I might not allowed
to listen to Master Puppets in the car
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the fucking speeding ticket fucking
right there master oh shit I'm getting
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled over the blue lights go with it
great though just keep drinking cops like
[SPEAKER_02]: you were fucking nailing it but you're
going 120 just a minute officer let's get
[SPEAKER_04]: through the chorus check out the drum solo
[SPEAKER_02]: you getting this on your fucking body cam
sir all right let's move forward there
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike Mike let's talk about I kind of know
what you like to listen to but let's be
[SPEAKER_02]: fair and give you an opportunity to talk
about it what do you like to listen to
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're good in stone bro though the
parameters you set originally the first
[SPEAKER_05]: song that popped into my head was Tom
Petty running down a dream nice I was just
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna hop into the car just a little lit
and pick a song that would be high on the
[SPEAKER_05]: list to start off the ride home if it had
to be a whole album that gets harder all
[SPEAKER_05]: right I was never an album guy there was
very few albums that I would put in and
[SPEAKER_05]: play Nirvana unplugged anyone my age
that's on the list of whole albums or
[SPEAKER_02]: listen to something about being a musician
we put on the whole album because we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to skip we don't want to put on
another disc between songs because we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to stop playing our drums or
guitar so you just press play on the album
[SPEAKER_02]: and put on your headphones and you learn
the whole album that's I was never an
[SPEAKER_05]: album that's what I really dug soundtracks
for a while because it was never like five
[SPEAKER_05]: great songs and then seven fillers it was
like at least all pretty good yeah I like
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's cool makes sense so we've got
running down a dream I hear some Tom Petty
[SPEAKER_02]: in my head I'll drive this bucket on that
song that started off so many drives in my
[SPEAKER_02]: life that's way off of what I would have
expected you to so if you're not driving
[SPEAKER_02]: then what else are you gonna listen to you
like what's what else are you down to I
[SPEAKER_05]: want you to say it's pretty eclectic like
you always give me shit for 311 which is
[SPEAKER_05]: totally fair because I've probably seen
him in concert 20 times over my life there
[SPEAKER_05]: were the last band I saw in concert if
that's the question they were not the
[SPEAKER_05]: first but they were one of the first that
like as an adult it wasn't like I can't
[SPEAKER_05]: count the Beach Boys concert that I went
to when I was eight because that wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: like a conscious choice I made that wasn't
a stylistic statement about me I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe Boyz II Men when I was like 14 for
two tours that counts no that was all me
[SPEAKER_05]: and my brother being like dude you have to
take us or we will fucking ruin your
[SPEAKER_05]: summer Montel Jordan Missy Elliott and
Boyz II Men for the two tour at Fiddler's
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that that kind of counts and
then 311 was the first one that I was like
[SPEAKER_05]: no I work for this money I'm spending this
money how I want going to 311 at Red Rocks
[SPEAKER_05]: or the Ogden or the Fillmore there's so
many but there's some electronic in there
[SPEAKER_05]: like if I had to pick a whole album to
listen to like happy to be hardcore volume
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 would be on there that was yeah that's
part of my life that you I probably
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't shared with you at all because
you're a fucking fish head I feel like we
[SPEAKER_05]: did different drugs in college we did very
different drugs in college or in the time
[SPEAKER_05]: when you could have been in college yeah I
wasn't in college but I was at you were in
[SPEAKER_05]: the band when I was in college but you you
lived on on one kind of yeah no country in
[SPEAKER_05]: my repertoire some some metal but not like
a ton Ramstein's in there a little bit if
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to go for like top metal for a
while that that album that hit big here in
[SPEAKER_05]: the States was one of the albums that I
would listen to it was one of the only
[SPEAKER_05]: ones I had with me when I went to France
the first time when dismons were a thing
[SPEAKER_05]: and so I would put it on listen to the
first track and fall asleep on the tour
[SPEAKER_05]: bus and wake up three hours later wherever
we were headed like having listened to all
[SPEAKER_05]: of it in my sleep and absorbed lots of
angry German metal did yours have the bass
[SPEAKER_05]: boost button it did and the thing that
swore it would not skip for 30 seconds but
[SPEAKER_02]: that was a fucking lie yeah yeah because
you would have to wait 30 seconds for it
[SPEAKER_02]: to play if it really works like that right
wouldn't you have to be 30 seconds behind
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the science behind it but it's not
fun no I know I know better it's reading
[SPEAKER_02]: faster I get it but still it makes my
brain goes you've got to get a 30 second
[SPEAKER_02]: head start then yeah yeah Jeff like I
don't watch TV shows on TV ever because I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to fast forward through the
commercials I will wait 10 minutes for
[SPEAKER_02]: that show to be fucking 10 minutes late
just so I don't have to watch any
[SPEAKER_02]: commercials all right so Mike your music
is very eclectic bro very eclectic lately
[SPEAKER_05]: there's been a lot of rise against but I'm
not 100 percent sure if that's because I
[SPEAKER_05]: really like it or because I really fucking
miss raging this machine I think we can
[SPEAKER_02]: all agree on rage against the machine at
this table I can't believe they're fucked
[SPEAKER_05]: into hitting tour dates but like I'm not
rich and can't take flying across the
[SPEAKER_05]: country to go see a concert trip right now
so what gives you some kind of feels what
[SPEAKER_05]: song every time you hear it you go ah
there's too many to pick one okay I've
[SPEAKER_02]: listed off many yeah yeah all right well
then this one should be easy and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: just gonna start with you again and work
our way back around I figure if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna talk about music we should also talk
about movies every stoner likes a good
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking stoner movie right it doesn't have
to be a stoner movie but what do you like
[SPEAKER_02]: to get stoned and just lay around and
watch a movie what movie are you gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking put on with one of your favorite
movies he's really thinking you guys you
[SPEAKER_05]: can I don't have favorites like this like
that if you had to pick five for a fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: desert island I'm like okay when I finish
the fifth one I'm shooting myself you know
[SPEAKER_05]: that's how this ends right because if I
can't take them all fuck that um but right
[SPEAKER_05]: now it would probably be something out of
Kevin Smith's library okay cool then I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna make you watch tusk all the time god
damn it you gotta pick that one it can't
[SPEAKER_05]: be fucking top out or one of the other
shitty ones it's got to be fucking tusk
[SPEAKER_05]: you made me do it bro what about red state
I'll watch that shit a couple of times all
[SPEAKER_05]: right I'll let you have red state we're
fucking but I was thinking more like
[SPEAKER_05]: clerks to or just strike back or watch
Jersey girl I'm pissed at this one that
[SPEAKER_05]: reboot didn't get released nationally that
it's he's touring at Roadshow till it hits
[SPEAKER_02]: DVD and I have to fucking wait Mike's a
big Kevin Smith nerd if you haven't cut on
[SPEAKER_02]: he doesn't see Kevin Smith at a live show
one time it was a good fucking time yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a nice little show in the front row
even I'm glad that happened I was excited
[SPEAKER_02]: for that thank you bro all right so Mike
wants to see Kevin Smith stuff Mike just
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to meet and greet and hang out Kevin
Smith and be his homie for the rest of his
[SPEAKER_02]: life he even smokes weed now like it's
gonna fucking happen fat man and beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: our worlds are slowly inching towards each
other we'll do podcasting and what we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: get there all right man what movies do you

[SPEAKER_02]: movies do you like to watch what's your
favorite movie when you're all stoned um I
[SPEAKER_01]: like Paul recently all right I know that's

head knowing that that's the wrong person
[SPEAKER_05]: not able to say Seth Rogan now that's
funny but and an alien I'm in for that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit for sure I wanted Seth Rogan to be an
alien suddenly or Seth Green to be an
[SPEAKER_05]: alien now I was listening to Joe Rogan on
the way over here and I kept seeing like
[SPEAKER_05]: you were saying Seth Rogan and I was like
Joe Rogan no not to do with the podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: that'd be Jar Jar Binks by the way if that
happened Seth Rogan is an alien would be
[SPEAKER_01]: Jar Jar Binks that's right yeah oh yeah

Disney Plus yeah and it's eight episodes
[SPEAKER_04]: and I got to put that over it was
fantastic nice there was one episode I was
[SPEAKER_04]: on the edge of my seat I would never that
is sin I would just put it over it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: saying hey it's worth the like eight hours
overall all right it's not like super long
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really well done I'm just I don't
know I watched it it was excellent feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like that's a cop-out because you answered
with the series and mine would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: Narcos yeah Doug Benson wouldn't allow it
well then well maybe then okay Mike let's
[SPEAKER_02]: hear about your favorite goddamn series I
want a movie I'm just gonna put that over
[SPEAKER_02]: he said half-baked he's cool dang this
ain't Doug loves movies I'm gonna let it
[SPEAKER_02]: slide there's no prize bag okay Jeff loves
Clint judge is cool with Jeff loves
[SPEAKER_02]: dabbing so I'm gonna have to check that
out a lot of people have I see baby Yoda
[SPEAKER_02]: the Mandalorian the baby Yoda Mandalorian
that's all social media talks about it's
[SPEAKER_02]: butts drums weed and baby Yoda that's all
it's on my fucking Instagram interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram feed it's beautiful bro what
else could you ask for butts drums weed
[SPEAKER_04]: and baby Yoda it's working for me I don't
know man it was excellent I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people are gonna agree it just was well
done I'm not a huge Star Wars guy I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: still loving it I've seen all the movies
but never like in depth I've never watched
[SPEAKER_04]: them I've probably seen at the most couple
of times each and that would be a stretch
[SPEAKER_04]: and I just that series is so well done
they really established really good
[SPEAKER_04]: characters and I know the writing was
really well done the videography is well
[SPEAKER_04]: done I don't know I just got to keep
putting it over Disney you can send your
[SPEAKER_02]: check to tall Clint that's true thank you
sponsors hashtag ad there we go positive
[SPEAKER_02]: energy so a very long time ago I was
talking about that time period like when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're fresh out of high school or you
might even still be in high school and you
[SPEAKER_02]: just need that place you can go party
sometimes and everybody's got the one
[SPEAKER_02]: friend whose parents just don't give a
fuck you can do whatever you want at that
[SPEAKER_02]: house and so I found that house and I went
there one night and we may or may have not
[SPEAKER_02]: have eaten a little bit too much LSD and
we possibly may have watched dazed and
[SPEAKER_02]: confused and half baked and Billy Madison
on a VHS tape that's how old I am you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: VHS and we would watch it and we were
tripping and when it ended we're like just
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking rewind it and do it again because
I don't know what else to do so the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: crew sat on the couch all night I think we
watched the whole videotape three times in
[SPEAKER_02]: a row probably just in the course of this
acid trip and those I can almost quote
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the lines from dazed and confused
that is one of my favorite movies and then
[SPEAKER_02]: in the future in my life if you've
listened to the podcast I ended up meeting
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody who's in that movie and it become
pretty damn good friends with that person
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's kind of cool but dazed and
confused has always been one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite movies I just fell in I knew I
loved it before I had acid and watched it
[SPEAKER_02]: like eight times I always knew it was
gonna be one of my favorites just a good
[SPEAKER_02]: stoner movie that's a great movie yeah
Friday is a good stoner movie half baked
[SPEAKER_02]: is a good one Billy Madison always have a
spot in my heart yeah I'm not a huge movie
[SPEAKER_02]: buff that's never been one of my my things
but those are a few of the good movies
[SPEAKER_02]: that I really enjoyed yeah if you're
unloading in Las Vegas that is a great one
[SPEAKER_02]: also Mike kind of shook his head like this
one I never got it well like every one of
[SPEAKER_05]: my friends loves that movie and I've
watched it several times and just been
[SPEAKER_05]: like like I get it but I guess I'm on the
wrong drugs yeah I was gonna say I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to elaborate too much on
your business but you never seem to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: one that's into the psychedelic or
psychedelia that's not your type of stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think it's because you are you know
about psychology and you want to not fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: up your psychology and you're worried
about it and I'm over here not too aware
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on in my brain I was like
some acid let's put it in there and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what it does and so that you allegedly
well back in the day I used to go to fish
[SPEAKER_02]: shows and eat too much acid I'm okay with
people knowing that's a thing but it you
[SPEAKER_02]: see things differently and you're into
different shit once you fucking open to
[SPEAKER_05]: that psychedelics were never my thing and
I talked to people that did them and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: like I don't want to take it for that ride
well like I'm gonna get on a different
[SPEAKER_01]: ride that sounds more fun well I've been
to Las Vegas like three times man and I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to go around like old Las Vegas and
just like after seeing the movie you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you just want to trip your ass off and
fuck go to circus circus it's fucking kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun she's trying to live the dream just
did your feet stick to the carpet like
[SPEAKER_01]: theirs no honestly I just got really
fucked up and I know I really don't
[SPEAKER_02]: remember a lot that's fucking awesome
Vegas there are a few fish shows where I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like huh I wish I would remembered
more of that show yeah that was an
[SPEAKER_04]: expensive memory loss heard that was a
good time I'm gonna have to listen to the
[SPEAKER_02]: recording um so did I get everybody's
movies yeah we got everybody's movies
[SPEAKER_02]: right yeah I talked about my movies Clint
came back to his I'm stoned you guys if
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't tell I'm gonna take a dab here
pretty soon because I could be it's about
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 stoner the word I can be stoner Matt's
over there packing a bowl he's got the
[SPEAKER_02]: right idea um let's see since he's packing
a bowl this is a good way to segue into
[SPEAKER_02]: this 2019 just passed we're at the start
of 2020 here I'm glad I got the year right
[SPEAKER_02]: because I said it wrong in a previous
episode and it made me feel like shit um
[SPEAKER_02]: we're at the start of a new year just
wrapped up an old year episode 500 this is
[SPEAKER_02]: a good time to talk about strains of 2019
did any strains stand out to you guys in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2019 or what was the winning strain for
you last year Matt's laughing go for oh my
[SPEAKER_01]: god did you fucking win with your goddamn
baby shit smelling dabs over there that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the winner dookie yeah I don't think
that's the winner it stands out you can
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking have it if you find it no no I
don't find it like you know as one I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke but it's definitely the most
unique strain have you smelled this yet my
[SPEAKER_02]: nose doesn't work just tell the mic what
you smell yeah your nose is a little off
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah my nose doesn't work that well
guys all right yeah it's I mean it's
[SPEAKER_02]: something I'm gonna get it doesn't work
like that I'll let you guys in the room
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about the aromas you go ahead Matt
you know you've talked about what it
[SPEAKER_01]: smells like and then I'll give you my
description at the end um it is it is like
[SPEAKER_01]: a like a baby shit next to you in a
restaurant and you're just like wow yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: that's definitely baby shit it's a diaper
duty yeah and you know you kind of get
[SPEAKER_05]: some of that diaper it has a diaper genie
ask funk to it I described it as a medium
[SPEAKER_02]: sized dog took a dump in the lawn but it's
a lawn with grass about an inch tall and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's in the shade so there's plenty of
moisture but the outer layer of the dog
[SPEAKER_02]: turd has hardened and become dark but then
you ran it over with the lawnmower and
[SPEAKER_02]: broke it open and that splatter middle
moist poop smell that comes out real
[SPEAKER_02]: strong and punches you in the face and you
almost have to like scrape it off your
[SPEAKER_02]: tongue I think that's what that smells
like and I'm not exactly sure why I bought
[SPEAKER_02]: it I think I was curious I was like that
smells terrible I want to take a dab of
[SPEAKER_02]: that and then I dabbed it and that dog
turd turp oh you don't want to dab that I
[SPEAKER_02]: apologize I'm not even gonna say what it
is or where it came from we don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: need to talk about that but if you go to
the dispensary and you get the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: smells like a hot dog shit just skip it
that's my advice oh man you know weird
[SPEAKER_01]: turps have been in lately but that's one I
just I I don't know yeah the doctor is not
[SPEAKER_01]: on my palate you know we'll go funky
garlic body odor smell all day you know
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think that one's on a no-fly list
yeah stay above the waist all right so now
[SPEAKER_02]: let's get real bro let's get real because
man if that's your strange choice for the
[SPEAKER_01]: year you've got issues well no no I mean
if that's like the most like standout one
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think I've come across it in the
year as far as like just things that just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of blew my mind as to why does this
exist all right yeah why does that exist
[SPEAKER_01]: that smells so fucking miserable I got a
wonder about the grower who like had that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know come out and then just was like
oh man fucking yes you know like I just
[SPEAKER_01]: got a wonder what that guy if he's like
the guy who like scratches his ass and
[SPEAKER_01]: then just you know he gets a whiff every
once in a while or something and he just
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoys that I don't know man I don't
remember growing that I don't know they
[SPEAKER_05]: say like there are people out in the world
that like black liquorice like it could
[SPEAKER_05]: just be one of those things but I really
think that was something that they grew
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're like well we're not throwing it
away because we don't waste stuff here
[SPEAKER_05]: process it and like whoever buys it I'm
sorry yeah but we need our 750 a gram
[SPEAKER_01]: wholesale or we can't survive so I'll tell
you what it makes a great gag flavor you
[SPEAKER_02]: get to be stoned so this guy won't leave
dad they got me really really stoned like
[SPEAKER_02]: like I was like I get high off of most of
the concentrates but it made me like
[SPEAKER_01]: droopy like more I'm stoned yeah yeah
wasn't bad as far as like good flavors
[SPEAKER_01]: good strains this year I think GMO man
just is it's just been popping all year
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody who's put it out has done an
excellent job I've been in love with that
[SPEAKER_02]: garlic turp bro just killing it GMO real
quick GMO doesn't mean garlic mushroom
[SPEAKER_02]: onions from the to the best of my
knowledge here's what I know about GMO we
[SPEAKER_02]: got way sidetracked but you said that a
lot of people have the wrong idea what GMO
[SPEAKER_02]: why it's called that GMO it's not a
genetically modified strain it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: garlic mushroom onions I think it's chem
four and Girl Scout cookies it's a chem
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies cross I think that's correct from
I'm just trying to go from memory here a
[SPEAKER_02]: guy named skunk master flex called it GMO
it's a phenotype that he found in a pack
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds and he called it GMO because it's
got Girl Scout cookies in there and it
[SPEAKER_02]: smells really crazy it's got a chemical
funky smell to it at that time the Girl
[SPEAKER_02]: Scout cookies organization was under
scrutiny because it was discovered that
[SPEAKER_02]: their cookies were being made with
ridiculous GMO products so Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies Girl Scout cookies were popular
the GMO thing came up in the news that
[SPEAKER_02]: strain smelled really funky let's put the
word GMO on that cross that's how GMO got
[SPEAKER_02]: that name that's why it's called that so
let me clear up a bunch of crazy weird
[SPEAKER_02]: rumors and bullshit on the internet and
that's what this podcast was designed for
[SPEAKER_02]: but dude I totally agree with you that the
GMO is fucking awesome that garlic turp
[SPEAKER_02]: that fucking earthy savory thing I've been
talking about garlic mashed potatoes dabs
[SPEAKER_02]: for like since fucking the summer and I
love it dude garlic banger anything with
[SPEAKER_02]: that garlic fucking mmm yeah savory turp
yeah it's addictive man yeah you just want
[SPEAKER_02]: one the buzz from it is beautiful it's
like a nice body buzz and a face high
[SPEAKER_02]: something about that garlic turp gives you
a nice high that's one of those you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: stop smelling in your jar even though you
don't want to crack it they never have
[SPEAKER_02]: more at the dispensary because I've talked
too much about the garlic turp so it
[SPEAKER_02]: always sells out all the garlicky shit
goes quickly yeah Clint you're new bro um
[SPEAKER_02]: so you haven't had as much experience
throughout the years to see the hype in
[SPEAKER_02]: this the strain hype and popularity but
did anything stand out for you in 2019
[SPEAKER_04]: strain wise no man I've just been kind of
smoking all the homegrown stuff so it's
[SPEAKER_04]: been like I'm not paying attention to
anything in stores or anything I love that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're uh just kind of your own stoner in
your own stoner bubble you're not like
[SPEAKER_02]: over here trying to be hyped up with
everybody just doing the Clint thing and
[SPEAKER_04]: you smoke some weed sometimes I think
that's the best way to be you just got to
[SPEAKER_04]: be yourself and not really follow a whole
bunch of trends most people aren't even
[SPEAKER_04]: good at being themselves yet yeah you know
that's ego man that's that's the first
[SPEAKER_04]: thing you get rid of when you start being
yourself there you go keep smoking what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're smoking it's working I think so
Mike gelato was everywhere last year
[SPEAKER_02]: gelato was everywhere that is for sure I
see Mike bless you I had a strain in mind
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was gonna talk about it just left
my head so I hope somebody else keeps
[SPEAKER_05]: talking it seemed like at the start of the
year it was cookies everything yeah you
[SPEAKER_05]: went to the store one day and they were
like no it's gelato now pick one it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: all right if that's the new thing yeah
frosty one was it your peach smash record
[SPEAKER_04]: your peach record seemed like you were
getting pretty hype on it I took a dab of
[SPEAKER_02]: that peach record a minute ago and
everybody in the room made this face up oh
[SPEAKER_02]: that smells really good yeah yeah the
strains that I noticed for 2019 were of
[SPEAKER_02]: course the Mac the fucking Mac was
everywhere shout out to Jaren for growing
[SPEAKER_02]: the fuck out of the Mac shout out to the
Green Dot crew for making some amazing Mac
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates they made some Mac pens some
Mac carts I'm actually gonna grab a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of Mac carts we've got a little adventure
coming up we'll have a Mac cart for that
[SPEAKER_02]: adventures we get some Mac cart adventure
yeah the miracle alien cookies it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere everybody's been breeding to it
everybody's been working with it I've
[SPEAKER_02]: grown it I've smoked it that was one of
the most popular for 2019 which is amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got a nice story behind it the
breeders super popular a lot of hype for
[SPEAKER_02]: that one also the GMO like you said bro
the GMO was one of my favorites for the
[SPEAKER_02]: year then I would be silly if I didn't
talk about some things that really
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised me strawberry fucking starburst
strawberry starburst has blown up this
[SPEAKER_02]: year that's been the strain of the year
for me other than a rise which is always
[SPEAKER_02]: my most popular but strawberry starburst
really took off people are making amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates amazing photos it's amazing
smoke amazing harvest weights I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: getting major reports on strawberry
starburst it's been fucking impressive so
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's the one that kind of blew me
away this year I didn't expect it it came
[SPEAKER_02]: out of nowhere there's just there's one of
my like kind of one of my favorites but
[SPEAKER_02]: not like my top like ooh can't live
without with that one but then it just
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking expanded up quickly that's super
killing it so the strawberry is one that
[SPEAKER_02]: blew me out of the out of the water what
do you guys see coming up for 2020 you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys have any predictions any strains any
flavors any trends in cannabis that you
[SPEAKER_01]: see for 2020 everybody just shook their
heads it's funny I see a lot of now and
[SPEAKER_02]: later process coming out yeah a lot of
that now and later the mochi gelato type
[SPEAKER_02]: of crosses I also see a lot of people
going back toward the cheesy sort of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's another strain that I see a lot of
hype based on also skunk is making a
[SPEAKER_01]: comeback I've seen a few people trying to
bring skunk back it's funny because skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: and cheese are the same thing just
phenotypes of the same lineage yeah that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the skunk and the cheese it's the same
thing basically just get a real cheesy
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype of the skunk or a real skunky
phenotype of the skunk that's fucking yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: so we're gonna see skunky cheesy stuff I
really like the way that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate companies are kind of making
their connoisseur blends they're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: their own flavor their own style and green
dot lab seems to have a nice thing going
[SPEAKER_02]: on they got the cherry they got the peach
they've got the mimosa the dosis of
[SPEAKER_02]: mimosas they've got a nice thing going on
with their blends apothecary's got a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of nice blends going on I like the way
that the individual companies are making
[SPEAKER_02]: their own like connoisseur styles that's
making it really nice see a lot of great
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors come out of there each brand has
sort of a flavor that catches on like
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody knows about apothecary's
clementine we all know that that's fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hot fire everybody knows they're a couple
from fucking green dot that we could talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about but everybody knows that each
company's got that one or two that stands
[SPEAKER_02]: out and I loved it that sort of stuff is
coming up and that I'm able to find it
[SPEAKER_02]: where I am that's also something I love
but I see more of the the skunky stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I see more of these connoisseur
blends coming out things like the doses
[SPEAKER_02]: and mimosas and stuff like that are going
to keep killing it those like custom
[SPEAKER_02]: blends that they're making I've talked
about in the future we're going to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about what we like you basically
can tell a guy behind a counter or maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: computer that this is what I like and then
you press button and then it spits out a
[SPEAKER_02]: slurpee that is concentrate it's five
percent this six percent this I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that's where we were headed at the start
of last year it's the start of 2019 but I
[SPEAKER_05]: think we took a hard turn away from that
about halfway through the year with the
[SPEAKER_05]: bait prices shit the market shrank by like
80 across the country a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: companies that were heavily moving that
way have shifted back into other products
[SPEAKER_05]: different types of concentrates away from
the pens and the cartridges so I think one
[SPEAKER_02]: day I'll have a card just like my ATM card
but I stick into a machine or maybe it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be my fucking retina I'll look into this
machine it'll scan my retina and I'll go
[SPEAKER_02]: beep beep oh what's up Rasta Jeff are you
here for your concentrate refill and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: go yes I am I go do you need your daytime
your afternoon or your nighttime refill
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll go yes please then press a button
to give me all three it'll spit out three
[SPEAKER_02]: little containers that have got a perfect
mix of what I asked for this much THC this
[SPEAKER_02]: much limonene this much mercine whatever
you know what I mean in each jar they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be labeled exactly for me Jeff's daytime
evening nighttime medicines I think we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: all be able to get our own custom Slurpee
blend in the future it'll be kind of neat
[SPEAKER_02]: so in the back of somewhere like instead
of having the fucking coke dispenser that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes and it spits out the syrup there's be
a bunch of cannabinoids and terpenes and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the other compounds that go into our
dads I'll just be chilling out in the back
[SPEAKER_02]: in a bunch of bulk then you got to just
mix them up in small quantities and spit
[SPEAKER_02]: them out in gram portions for us that's
the future you guys that's the Jetsons of
[SPEAKER_05]: dabbing I just want a place that's gonna
have quality flour on the shelf week after
[SPEAKER_02]: week isn't that a struggle we live in a
state that it is completely legal we've
[SPEAKER_02]: got commercial grows on every fucking
block if you go to the right area there
[SPEAKER_02]: are a lot of commercial grows if you know
what to look for and we still have a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis shortage here there's not quality
cannabis on the top shelf in every
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary all the time it's not a fully
open market yet it's still like half the
[SPEAKER_05]: places are vertically integrated or trying
to be the other half their wholesaler
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't have what they normally do so their
order got switched up and shorted and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just watching it all settle out like don't
get me wrong it's been a lot of fun and
[SPEAKER_05]: every time I get down on our local market
I just get online and check out what's
[SPEAKER_05]: life is like in like Pennsylvania right
now yeah yeah shut the fuck up for six
[SPEAKER_02]: months but yeah well Mike that's a good
segue um we've been doing a lot of great

[SPEAKER_02]: new situation with the two kids and the
new living situation life kicks your ass
