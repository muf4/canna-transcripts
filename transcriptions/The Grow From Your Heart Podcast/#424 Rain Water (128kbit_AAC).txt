[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 424 of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon elite seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Oregon elite seeds and you can
find them at www.OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm sure most of you know that
I like to start this podcast off by
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of Tropicana
cookies, full spectrum extract from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says this product has
76.3% THC, 0% CBD and 87.5% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack this jar open and give
it a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost like a grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have ever drank a product called a
Grapefruit Izzy, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: this smells just like a fresh cold
grapefruit Izzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost smell the carbonation in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the flavor and aroma on
this product and the high goes straight to
[SPEAKER_00]: my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me chattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me creative and talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is perfect podcast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves a really great kind of a sweet
and sour sort of a candy flavor in my
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth, which is really pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out again to our friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropicana cookies, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I do plan to read a
couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another submission about what 420
means to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout

[SPEAKER_00]: I just appreciate you for listening and
enjoying the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to you also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I've got a couple of emails
to read for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a question that you would
like me to read on the show, you can send
[SPEAKER_00]: me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first email for this episode goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, my name is Mike and I'm
from Prohibition Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I want to say thank you for
what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you help people, but honestly,
you probably have no clue how much you do
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that means a lot to me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate hearing that I'm helping
somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the show is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just knowing that I'm helping you means
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've honestly never thought about how far
my show reaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I get a lot of comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of interaction, but I'm really
not sure exactly how much help I am
[SPEAKER_00]: providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to know that I'm probably reaching
further than I had realized is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: compliment and a great little boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say when I decided to email
you my question, I just plan to email you
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask you the question, but you asked on
your show what 420 means to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a little bit late and I'm not
saying this because of a contest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when 420 means to me is seeing my mom
smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this email is referring to right
here is a few episodes before 420,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started asking my audience for
submissions to tell me what 420 means to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy is a little bit late for the
420 episode, but I still want to hear his
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion and I still want to share his 420
story with you and what 420 means to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that phrase right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had a parent say,
I'm not mad at you, but I'm disappointed
[SPEAKER_00]: in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, that's the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather somebody be fucking mad at me
because I fucked up when you feel that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointed in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes you feel like shit as a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes you feel about two inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes you feel so weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, ah, you know, they're only a
couple of people you really want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: happy in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're younger, it's your mom and
your dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when one of them says I'm
disappointed, ah, that just fucks
[SPEAKER_00]: everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even worse, she was disappointed in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's fast forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am 36 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was 31, my mom was diagnosed with
severe rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is painful and miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says little did I know what my
mother was about to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: RA is miserable to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is almost as miserable watching
someone you love experience those sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost see the pain in their
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost see the pain in their
joints when they walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know that person, you have seen
them go from a healthy person to a person
[SPEAKER_00]: who hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just terrible to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says within four years, my mom had both
of her hips and both of her shoulders
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced from her joints flattening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then shortly after, she was diagnosed with
severe COPD and congestive heart failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor told my mom that she had two
choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could prescribe her opioid pain meds
and she would be on them for the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if she went a day without them,
basically, God bless her soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other option was taking drugs that
killed her immune system so she would get
[SPEAKER_00]: sick easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sickness would get really bad
because her body can't fight it off
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she picked the opioid meds because it
honestly was the safer option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, she didn't have much to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had crap or crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like she picked the less
crappy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm sorry to hear that your mom and
your family are in this type of situation
[SPEAKER_00]: as if the RA weren't enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she had to have surgeries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she ends up with COPD, which is
chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes it hard to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you feel like you're drowning
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's also got congestive heart
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like she's having a string of
bad luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got her on opioid pain
medicine, which can't turn out well for
[SPEAKER_00]: her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says since we are in Indiana,
there is no medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had no other option than to wipe
out her immune system or just literally
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom being my mom, she just quit the
pain meds and suffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that's a strong lady right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For two years, she couldn't sleep or walk
without groaning every step because it
[SPEAKER_00]: hurts so badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is on oxygen and she can't smoke and a
good edible is impossible to get around
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get butter someone made that I'm
not even sure is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one day my buddy came back from
vacation from Cali and brought edible
[SPEAKER_00]: gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me being me, I had to buy some and try
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate two of them that night and I woke up
the next morning sitting in my recliner
[SPEAKER_00]: with a bowl of melted ice cream spilled
all over my lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like the gummy bears worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ate two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put you out while you were eating ice
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You woke up with ice cream all over your
lap, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how asleep this guy had to be if
cold ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was melted, but it still wasn't
warm and it was spilled in his lap on his
[SPEAKER_00]: junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how soundly this guy was sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those gummy bears were working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so I decide I'm going to make my
mom try one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy's mom was a teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was anti cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was not mad at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was disappointed when she discovered
that this person was a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy is going to try to give his
mom one of these cannabis infused gummy
[SPEAKER_00]: bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump back into the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I game planned all day how I was
going to bring it up to her and had built
[SPEAKER_00]: up the level of balls to actually offer my
60 year old ex school teacher mom
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, which isn't even legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally I go over there the next
evening and I just drop it on her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told her I have something I think will
help her sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked what and I told her and what
happened next blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy finally got the balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: He drove over there and he said,
mom, I got something I think is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened next is going to blow
our minds because she told me she has
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to try it and has been reading
about it, but didn't figure she would ever
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to get any because of their
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she snatched the gummy bear out of my
hand and couldn't chew it up fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool that your mom was not
only open to the idea, but she had been
[SPEAKER_00]: excited and researching the idea herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows you what pain and suffering
will do to you when you are in pain long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough and nothing works and you've got
enough things making you uncomfortable and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've tried something and it just made
you even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will open your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm ready to try just about
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that opened this lady's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was ready to try some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She snatched up this gummy bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: She chewed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read more into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I live 30 minutes away from her in
a different city, but my brother was
[SPEAKER_00]: taking care of her that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went home the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom calls me and tells me she got the
best sleep she has had since she got RA
[SPEAKER_00]: even better than with any pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bro said she was walking to the
bathroom without groaning in pain and was
[SPEAKER_00]: even walking faster than regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this lady ate one cannabis infused
gummy bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many milligrams it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the THC CBD ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem that that matters too much
because it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helped improve the quality of this
young lady's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her rheumatoid arthritis is not
debilitating her because cannabis eased up
[SPEAKER_00]: the symptoms enough for her to walk to the
bathroom without groaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if something you have to do
multiple times a day, like simply walk to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get there somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to either roll over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to crawl over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to walk over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do cartwheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to take a piss,
you got to get there or you get to wallow
[SPEAKER_00]: around in your own piss all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if that was painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting up right now to go piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: My back hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hips hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: My knees hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to grunt and groan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if your pain felt like that and
you found something that you could eat and
[SPEAKER_00]: it would take your pain away enough to
where you don't groan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still going to have some aches and
pains, some discomfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you could just take that one level
of just tone that down, take that off of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you are improving the quality of your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that not to be allowed because of
some invisible line that separates states
[SPEAKER_00]: from states and legality from legality,
that is fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lady feels better because she ate
something that came off of a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: grows out of the ground and the law is
trying to stop that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting way off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the problem is I can't barely get
edibles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gotten edibles three more times
since that people have brought from legal
[SPEAKER_00]: states and every time I get and give them
to my mom, she gets the biggest smile on
[SPEAKER_00]: her face because she knows she is going to
get some relief and some sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that invisible line that prevents
people from getting relief and sleep is
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking ridiculous in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind, there's more to this email and it
says, even though it is just a few hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of a break, it means everything to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I'm sure that's like setting down
weights that you've been carrying all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pain is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain will put you in a bad mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain will make you depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain will make you not able to enjoy your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that few hours of relief is everything
to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best few hours of her month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably when she gets to eat that edible
30, 45 minutes after it kicks in,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the best time of her month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could imagine that she gets a big
smile on her face, even though it is just
[SPEAKER_00]: a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, we will be lucky to have her with
us for another year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't think of anything better that I
could give her at this point in her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a bold finishing sentence right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be lucky to have her with you for
another year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm glad you have found something to
keep her comfortable for this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am saddened to hear that you've only got
her for another year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please enjoy that year with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't encourage you to acquire edibles
in your illegal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do anything to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, I hope that somehow you were able
to keep mom heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're able to spend a lot of time
with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enjoy her while she's here and keep
her as comfortable as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up this portion of the message
and it says, so that is what 420 means to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that is a serious, heavy,
deep 420 message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing so much with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of really serious,
really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does 420 mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody for opening up so
much to me, to the audience, for the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the sake of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a second half to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the question portion and it goes a
lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the cannabis here is all shitty,
swag, Mexican brick bullshit, I've decided
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow or hopefully grow some
quality cannabis to make edibles for my
[SPEAKER_00]: mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I can't encourage,
condone or promote you doing anything
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal, but you're an adult, so you are
responsible for yourself and I am proud of
[SPEAKER_00]: you for taking action to take care of your
mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will continue with the message and it
says, I know hydro isn't the smartest way
[SPEAKER_00]: for a noob, but from what I understand,
it is quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to grow three plants in
soil in case I fuck up the hydro,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have studied a lot more on soil
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's talk about one
statement here in that first paragraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I know hydro isn't the smartest
for a noob, but from what I understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will grow more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to cut off seven to 10
days of your veg time, depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: big you want your plants, but it's not
going to go so much more quickly that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to save you a lot of time,
especially in a small home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to be running small
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One or two weeks at the very most is all
you're going to save in a hydro setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take you a couple of
runs to get that dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, they may grow more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see more productivity in a hydro
system, but it is going to take more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to take more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay much more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also notice that the plants in soil
are much more forgiving than the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: your hydro system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mess up with your soil crop,
you can rescue it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a small mistake in your
hydroponic setup, you will notice it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be hard to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil is much more forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, talking about being faster,
it is going to take the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in soil, soilless mix,
hydro, whatever you're growing in,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your setup is, if your plant
takes nine weeks to flower, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take nine weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make it go faster because of
your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, in theory, your hydroponic plant
will grow a little more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get larger, but it also is more
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot more attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you mess up, it is much harder to
correct your mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run a few plants in hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run a few plants in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really hoping that you're going to run
the same cultivar in each setup so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pay attention to what's going on
and not be confused by different plants
[SPEAKER_00]: reacting differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that is in your hydroponic
setup and your soil setup, I hope you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got golden goat in hydro and golden goat
in soil and not golden goat in soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking blue dream in hydro because those
are two different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow two different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier to have one plant and
learn that one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about that in previous
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just my suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're a grown ass man or a grown
ass woman or a grown ass non-binary
[SPEAKER_00]: gendered adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would suggest one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to run the same thing,
especially as a new grower running
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, you've got an opportunity to
learn a lot about one specific cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get six clones or eight
clones of one thing and plant them in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro and in your soil, and then you have
some room for experiments with each one
[SPEAKER_00]: within each setup, you can learn a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically like having two grows
that you can experiment on at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, again, highly suggest one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that you're in prohibition land,
so you're going to have to get whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have access to clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you feel about ordering
seeds online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like you're going to do a
pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're ready just to get
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get clones or seeds,
I assume you're going to just pop some in
[SPEAKER_00]: these pots and get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest doing a quick pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done episodes on pheno hunting
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do a quick pheno hunt,
find a keeper and then clone that cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: and run it throughout all of your systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn your systems and get that dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in listening to the
pheno hunt episode, I did an entire talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about pheno hunting on episode 376.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suggest starting with a pheno hunt,
narrow it down to one keeper, then work
[SPEAKER_00]: that one keeper and all systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my idea for what I would do if I
were you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this email, so I need to
get my rambly ass back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out again to the Tropicana
Cookies Full Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really got me talkative for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, My question is this and it
relates to both soil and hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always hear you talk about reverse
osmosis or filtered water being the best
[SPEAKER_00]: to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about pH rainwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be good to use to put your
newts in and water your soil plants or to
[SPEAKER_00]: run in your deep water culture reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering because I went to
Walmart and I have a 20 gallon res.
[SPEAKER_00]: RO water was $6.50 for five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I go that route, I'll be spending
$32 a week just on water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If rainwater isn't good, is there a
cheaper option?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwater is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwater will contain trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most regions, rainwater should be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a really densely,
if you live in China, you may reconsider
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of pollution,
a lot of fog, you may reconsider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most areas you should be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to think about when you are
collecting rainwater, how are you
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that water running off of something
before it gets to your collection vessel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it coming off of the tin roof,
which may have rust on it, which may have
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about where that water is
running before it ends up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: collection vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be safe to feed to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, add your nutrients,
then adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to put nutrients in
it, then adjust the pH before feeding it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't adjust the pH, then put newts in it
because you're going to have to adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nutrients, pH, check your EC and your
PPMs and then feed it to the plants if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were in the acceptable ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a follow up question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, also, what is the best
temperature to keep my water in my res?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading everything from 55 to 72
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use my name and location on the
show if you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe someone important will hear it and
change these BS laws here so my mother can
[SPEAKER_00]: get the relief she so desperately needs
and deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best wishes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sends a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I hope that somebody realizes that
cannabis is helping your mother improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of her life and they will help
change those bullshit laws that we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's address this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, what is the best temperature to
keep the water in my reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say somewhere between 62 and
68 degrees is the best range to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the water in your
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any colder than that, the plants will
start slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't take up any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The metabolism will start slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will actually think that it is
becoming winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not flowering the plants,
they may try to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may try to start finishing and
ripening up because that's what they think
[SPEAKER_00]: it is time for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think, oh, it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere between 62 and 68 degrees
would be your ideal temperature to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants in their most vigorous state
of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long, great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend,
Mike, out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who's your country?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, I hope you and your mom are
both doing wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said at the start of the show,
I had two emails to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one email got away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little rambly, a little long
winded because of these Tropicana cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means there is only one email on
this episode, which means I have got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of great content for future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with a long,
