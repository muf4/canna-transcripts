[SPEAKER_00]: for letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Koo, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab of some lemon
OG shatter, and I dunked it in some lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: jeffery high terpene full spectrum
extract, and I took the dab a little too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, and it sent me to another planet for
a second, but I am back and I'm ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends that were
joining me on Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing some Instagram Live videos
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I go to the iRi Genetics
Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iRi underscore genetics, and I go
live occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't been doing it a whole bunch,
but I just did a nice little Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: video with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, this podcast is
brought to you by our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you want to add some new
seeds to your lineup, if you need new
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in the garden, if you need
regular or feminized genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you check out thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thedankteam.com carries brands like

[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics, Rare Dankness, the Cali
Connection, and many more trusted brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out thedankteam.com
and let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get down to business,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: On episode number 250, I challenged you
guys to identify the backwards voice and
[SPEAKER_00]: the voice that said, oh shit, Rasta Jeff,
in the opening song on episode 248.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, on number 248, okay,
on all of the throwback Thursdays,
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes lately, I've been playing some
goofy music that I've made myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: just playing around, putting stuff
together with GarageBand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make funky music when I'm all
stoned, just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted a cool opening for Thursday,
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what came out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to put some voices in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one backwards and it says
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody did identify the backwards voice
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people have identified the
voice that said, oh shit, Rasta Jeff in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, let me say it was not Doug
Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people thought it was Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the people that tweeted me,
that sent me emails, they all said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to tell you who it actually was,
I'm going to read a tweet from somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who calls themselves Rex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their Twitter handle is fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Tip Top Magoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know anything about podcasting
or comedy, you know that Tip Top Magoo is
[SPEAKER_00]: a Joey Diaz reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this person said, that's our boy Lee
Boom Boom Sayat, the flying Jew,
[SPEAKER_00]: the original Christ killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Lee Sayat, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee Sayat was the person who said,
oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several people guessed that it was Lee
Sayat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read a couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure this email came from,
excuse my voice though, that's from the
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure this email came from our
friend Tip Top Magoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure this correlates.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, hey Rasta Jeff, I love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been regularly listening since around
1.40, but have caught up on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes thanks to the Throwback Thursday
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from California and have one grow
under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't go so well due to high
temps and a grow tent that was in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds disastrous if you don't
have proper air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said, I'm currently planning out
my next grow in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be donating to your Patreon and
writing an email asking about a sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: garden with CO2 supplementation in the
near future, which is excellent because
[SPEAKER_00]: another good friend of mine was asking
about sealed grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: With CO2 versus vented grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be a great topic for me to
research and give a good presentation on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the Patreon help and I
look forward to your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't know
about Patreon, check out patreon.com slash
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will tell you everything you want to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, anyways,
I'm in my thirties and I am a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: user.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your hard work on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he gives me his address because I
told him he would win a prize if he
[SPEAKER_00]: identified the voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he said, I don't dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding off on smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sober October, man, you get cooler by
the second in your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a Joey listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you're a Joey Diaz and a member
of the church of what's happening now by
[SPEAKER_00]: your tweets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're talking about sober
October, which means you listen to Rogan,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you listen to Bert,
which means you listen to Tommy Buns,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you probably listen to pants
or mom or Christina P, whatever you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to call her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that we should probably get
together and take some dabs if you're ever
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado or if I am ever in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I've got your address, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to need your real name
to send you a prize because I can't just
[SPEAKER_00]: send you stuff with no name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since I've got your address,
I think I've got your real name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not certain and I don't want to
send a package with no real name on it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will come back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not fucking around with the mail
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't put a full real name on it,
they just send shit right back and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to just resend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you a prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be anything illegal, so don't
worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be some stickers
and some other stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check your mailbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for being one of the first
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that you were the first one,
but I love that you said it's our boy Lee
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom Boom Syat, the Flying Jew original
Christ killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the Church of What's
Happening Now, you know what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy's cool as shit just for
saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the thanks for the
participation Tip Top Magoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's you who also sent
this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, it was Lee Syat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email or it's actually
probably from Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I think the person saying,
oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house is Lee
[SPEAKER_00]: Syat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a great podcast and the best podcast,
the best cannabis podcast available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very informative and thorough information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy, I think, was the first one to
email me saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was the first emailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that was you, send me a reply to
that, reply to this by sending me your
[SPEAKER_00]: address and I'll get you a prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know where you are and we'll get
you a little prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to get some stickers or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, we might meet up
and get you something cooler than
[SPEAKER_00]: stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next message I've got?
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, yo Rasta Jeff at the top of
episode 248.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they think it's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought it was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, by the way,
learned of you and your podcast at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grows Cup event this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the brown skin Rasta in the back
hanging near Dextractor and I live in
[SPEAKER_00]: Delaware.
[SPEAKER_00]: By chance I win, I'm coming to Colorado
for the prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time I'm in South Colorado,
need to know of a good, eye-tall vegan
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signed it with his real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also says, he signed it with
his AKA Defiaman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up, much respect, Defiaman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry you were not correct, but since
you're from Delaware, man, and we did not
[SPEAKER_00]: link up at the Dude Grows Cup,
the next time you're in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go get some vegan or eye-tall food
together and you will leave there with an
[SPEAKER_00]: iry gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit me up the next time you're coming
to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warn me because man, my schedule sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to give me a heads up a long
time in advance if you want to make plans
[SPEAKER_00]: with me, but do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll grab some eye-tall Rasta food or
some vegan food and we'll lace you up with
[SPEAKER_00]: some iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what up Rasta?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one comes from, let's see,
do they want their name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they want their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, what up Rasta?
[SPEAKER_00]: The backwards voice is Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fucking accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The backwards voice at the start of the
podcast where it was, there's a voice in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then it goes boom to boom to
boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That voice is the dabbing Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the oh shit voice is Lee
Syatt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person gets a prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all of these emails stacked up on
my desk right here so I can read them,
[SPEAKER_00]: reply to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your address, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get you a cool prize package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want your name said,
man, but the backwards voice absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: was Granny and nobody's going to figure
out that I just used the same clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, this is the dabbing Granny and
you're listening to the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That contest has been won.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through and if you tweeted
me and if you sent me an email,
[SPEAKER_00]: remind me and shoot me your address and I
will get you a prize package, some
[SPEAKER_00]: stickers, some whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, let's link up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you some cool prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm marking shit off the list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to the guy whose name starts with a
T.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a R and I got that guy and lots of
people on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep this pirate ship on course.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, I was complaining
that there was an iPhone update and I
[SPEAKER_00]: could not find some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure I'm not the only one that was
having a fucking problem with the iPhone
[SPEAKER_00]: email setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use the iPhone email app anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps telling me that all my passwords
are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go correct the password.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells me the password is wrong again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go create a new password and it keeps
telling me the wrong is pissing me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until they fix that, I'm going to avoid
that application.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did do though was I installed the
Gmail or the Hotmail app, whatever it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever corresponds with the email
addresses I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use those apps and they seem to be
working just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found all the emails I thought I was
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found all the tweets I thought I was
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is back to normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've sent me an email and I haven't
gotten to it yet, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you guys hear that jingle in the
background?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's McTheDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to McTheDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dog sitting tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: McTheDog is hanging out over there by the
door where the draft comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a great, quiet evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dog is so lazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those emails are back so I will get to
your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another thing, I was doing an
Instagram live video and a viewer on the
[SPEAKER_00]: video, it may have been Kelvin Medina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kelvin, either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me that Stitcher had not loaded
the Throwback Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would explain why the ratings were so
weak on Stitcher this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not get the Throwback Thursday
episode as expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is back up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reposted it right before I recorded this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this comes out, it should be
corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure that it's corrected by the
time this show posts Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stitcher's been corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emails have been corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we are talking about corrections,
let me reach for an email from a listener
[SPEAKER_00]: who corrected me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a recent episode, I think it was
number 252, I talked about deep water
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I talked about deep water culture,
I made it clear that I don't grow in deep
[SPEAKER_00]: water culture and I'm not 100% sure about
a lot of the things I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of what I said was accurate,
but a listener, a regular listener and a
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent emailer, Mr. St. Skinny,
sent me a message and it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Howdy Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if anyone mentioned this yet,
but you misspoke when you did your brief
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation of deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a deep water culture system,
the mist that keeps the roots above the
[SPEAKER_00]: water moist is produced via an air stone
and air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubbles from the stone float up and
pop, misting the roots and the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you are explaining sounds more like
aeroponics, where they use misters or
[SPEAKER_00]: spinning cloner type inserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I don't come off as rude or
anything that isn't my intention at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure you were made
aware of it so you can correct yourself on
[SPEAKER_00]: the next episode or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people really look forward
to your knowledge and information and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for correcting me,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never feel bad about being corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me a better grower,
makes me a better podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will never take offense to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the wrong shit and I know a lot of
people rely on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always, always correct me if I say
something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to get on the microphone
as soon as possible and make a correction
[SPEAKER_00]: in my error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to St. Skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, I owe you some stickers also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I'm sending out all of these
sticker packs for my friends on Twitter,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends that emailed me, everybody that
won these contests for the identifying Lee
[SPEAKER_00]: Syatt's voice, St. Skinny, you also send
me your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you some stickers or something
cool because you helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, great timing on the episode,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually finishing building my
aeroponic cloner as we speak and
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting some lemon balm into deep
water culture tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that means you've done that by now
because this was sent to me several days
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, almost a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this was recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell my dates anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time's traveling so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says, keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mama Saint wanted me to tell you you're
officially adopted and she says,
[SPEAKER_00]: hi son, love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better be staying out of trouble and
growing lots of dank like you're supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, your mom's cool as shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to be adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to be part of the Canna Saint
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Mama Saint, Skinny Saint,
Rasta Saint now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for making me part of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be in the car or wherever we
are right now listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm in the living room,
chilling with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys feel like you're at my
dab table, chilling with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be part of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: He finishes with, LOL, got a lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it easy, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he signs it, Saint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saint, Skinny, and fam, thanks for
reaching out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and respect to you and the whole
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad mom's doing well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we come back, I think I'm going to
read more emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got hydrated, took a couple of
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was scrolling through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was scrolling through Instagram,
I saw something that, I may sound like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hypocrite, but I saw something that I want
to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a video of a person taking a
gigantic dab while driving their car in
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic in California, going fairly fast
with a lot of traffic around them,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the window half down so everybody
could see them, and they were doing an
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a Snapchat video that got
posted up to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to shout out the account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds like I'm a hypocrite
because I have talked about medicating in
[SPEAKER_00]: a vehicle before, but there's a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicating in a vehicle and not getting
caught, that happened, that's over,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude posted it up to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the videos that you post to social
media, all of that shit, if you do do
[SPEAKER_00]: something and it goes wrong, what if this
guy was driving, and I know, I sound like
[SPEAKER_00]: a hypocrite, I sound like your dad,
I sound like an old man, but I want you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm supporting the cannabis community and
the legalization of cannabis, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: dumb shit is what will hinder it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am kind of hypocritical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have consumed cannabis in a vehicle
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not record it for Snapchat and
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those videos are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do end up doing something wrong,
if you hurt somebody while you're filming
[SPEAKER_00]: a dab video, or if you hurt somebody after
filming a dab video, and somebody sees a
[SPEAKER_00]: dab video of you on social media while
driving a vehicle, that's going to appear
[SPEAKER_00]: in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be on trial, and there's
going to be a big gigantic screen in a
[SPEAKER_00]: courtroom with a video of you taking a dab
in the car and blowing that dab out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next slide on that video is going to
be a picture of whoever you drove into in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hospital with a tube coming out of
their face and all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I'm kind of hypocritical,
but I'm calling myself out right along
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's quit posting videos of ourselves
consuming while driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just be smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just be safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about everything you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it as a headline in the
newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dumbass crashes car while dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be that dumbass,
do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, just support the legalization
of cannabis by not being a dumbass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to White Mike for making me
think straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now quite often I like to ask
people to let me know what they're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: on while they're listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to tweet me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to contact me somehow and let
me know how you were consuming cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: while listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tweet me at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to get in touch with me is
the growfromyourheartathotmail.com email
[SPEAKER_00]: address.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the easiest and most convenient
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener says, what up, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking Malibu pie while transplanting
and listening to the new topping episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you really do have the most grow
talk over any other podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not be the grower that I have
become if we didn't have you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I'm doing it on the down low
in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude's transplanting some Malibu,
or he's smoking some Malibu pie while
[SPEAKER_00]: doing transplanting work and listening to
my show while growing in an illegal state
[SPEAKER_00]: on the down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a lot of balls, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very brave growing down there in
North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy smoking that Malibu pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bro, be super careful out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad I've helped you out with your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for saying I've got the most
grow talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you're a good grower,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was able to help you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you become the grower you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you're getting it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, our next email
comes from Tert McGirt, and it goes like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, I've been a loyal listener
since like episode 89 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love the knowledge you
provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have taken a couple of genetics classes,
and you're quite on point with your
[SPEAKER_00]: explanations of genotype, phenotype,
transgressive segregation, and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom is now running a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is she is killing the not
so great clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for the email is I recently
bought a five pack of your Cookie Stomper
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from the dank team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had great service, by the way,
throwing in some bonus seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you had any tips or
helpful info on how it grows and finishes,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe what to look for or to identify the
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie Stomper, man, Cookie Stomper is a
great cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some very, it depends on
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, there'll be some very Girl Scout
Cookies dominant phenotypes in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: will grow kind of tall and kind of skinny,
and they'll just produce some popcorn
[SPEAKER_00]: balls up there, but they'll get real
purple and real black leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want like a peppery, spicy,
like a Durban Poison OG Kush Cross kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a flavor, I would go for that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a bigger producer,
there's definitely a phenotype in there
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a better producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll find the one that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of those phenotypes finish in
around eight, maybe nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to let them go too long,
any longer than nine weeks, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: is necessary with that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: 63 days, maybe 65 at the absolute most is
all you need for the Cookie Stomper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since she's a Cookie Cross, she can get
kind of picky about the pH, so make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you get your pH dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be different with each phenotype,
like the Girl Scout Cookies dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype may like it a little bit lower
than the phenotype that is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: King Kim Grape Stomper dominant,
so you're going to have to dial in your pH
[SPEAKER_00]: for your different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the challenge with that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the main part is look for the
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a smaller one,
which is Cookies dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a larger one, which of course
is the King Kim dominant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that comes out with these pine
cones that are real jaggedy and real
[SPEAKER_00]: sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just the best smoke, regardless of
how she grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I prefer to smoke,
and it's also the best representation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, or of the polyhybrid or of the
F1, however you want to consider that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows the cross the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he continues to say, Additionally,
they sent a three pack of some Cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cream to Arise, which has been named the
Cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, he says, in which I can't
find any info on the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will include some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent some pictures of it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, any tips or hints on this
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it eventually have a name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't found much online for this
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies and Cream to Arise has been
officially named the Cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly new.
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been much online for it so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been posting some pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you check out my Instagram,
iry underscore genetics, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool pictures of the Cream on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, my setup is illegal as
hell in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I even say Wisconsin if you said
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He continues to say, but I'm using two
hydrofoam ebbing flow recirculating
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One has 12 pots, two 1000 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other has 18 with three 1000 watt
lights because of power constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these three run at 600 watts for
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stagger them by six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our crops come from clones using an easy
cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the clones in the box for three
weeks acting like the seedling feeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give them clonex and rapid start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go into the hydropots with clay
pebble medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far you're doing all right,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question I have is that we go
right into 12-12 as soon as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted to the hydropots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no vegging aside from the extra week in
the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea what week we should start on in
the feeding schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: I argue week three, my partner says week
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our first run with your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more of the email also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna figure out this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you asking, when you put them into
flower, should you start on week one or
[SPEAKER_00]: week three of the flowering cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what the question is.
I'm not sure what the question is.
I'm not sure what the question is.
I'm not sure what the question is.
I'm not sure what the question is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're not vegging, you're going
directly to flower when you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them into the hydropots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would wanna feed them week one of the
flowering feed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's week one of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the day that you put them, it says we
go right into 12-12 as soon as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted into the hydropots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no vegging, which at that point,
I would say you want to give them week one
[SPEAKER_00]: of whatever your flowering nutrients are,
because it's week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea what week we should start on in
the feeding schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: I argue week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: My partner says week two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna argue and say week one,
because it's week one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've come from the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went an extra week in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the rapid start and stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live, they survive, they're rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going into your pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you putting them in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy cloner, clones into the box for three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can wrap, so they go into
hydropots with clay pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, start feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna flower them that day,
give them a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a flowering mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start feeding them flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna need vegetative
nutrients, because you're flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if I did not answer that
correctly, if I did not decipher that code
[SPEAKER_00]: or interpret your question correctly,
please re-email me and I will answer that
[SPEAKER_00]: more appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm a little confused as our batch
prior, supposedly something called Ice
[SPEAKER_00]: Princess and Northern Lights was
absolutely great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dense potent crystals and fire bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the last two cycles, the buds
have been fluffy and weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hot due to summer, but we run
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets up to 95 at times in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really have no climate controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the dense monsters were grown in the
winter, what's the ideal attempt to make
[SPEAKER_00]: these babies thrive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that was absolutely your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: 95 degrees is too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: 95 made them fluff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were getting sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't wanna, it was like sitting on
a hot bus with their legs crossed,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't wanna have their legs crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting goopy and hot and sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to uncross their legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had nowhere to go in that heat,
so they just started stretching,
[SPEAKER_00]: making some space in there and fluffing
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say you wanna get that temp closer
to 77, maybe 80, 81, 82 at the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never go any higher than 85.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it down to 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would maybe start off at like 85 in veg
and work my way down to like 77 during the
[SPEAKER_00]: day cycle, 85.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very start of flowering,
you're at 85.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end of the flowering cycle,
you've worked your way down to 77 during
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just kind of mimics the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of lets them know what part of
flower they're in and it encourages bud
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and it gives them better conditions
throughout their cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, there's more to the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ideal temps?
[SPEAKER_00]: So 77 degrees, 82 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the range I would stick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five degree range to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, are you experienced in hydro
setups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very much so, but I may be able to
help just because I've got some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The store was more than happy to sell it,
but now they seem to not want to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only talk about my crops in general as
not to spook them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get little help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how they are, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to give you help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to sell you more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they help you out, they could be part
of your crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may want to go to another hydro
store or just start shopping on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something goes wrong, they'll turn you
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not take the fall for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get in any trouble, they're going
to go, well, that other guy, he,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often does the reservoir need to be
scrubbed out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use to clean it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is bleach safe or something like hydrogen
peroxide?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would clean out the reservoir every
seven to 10 days, especially during
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you asked me the question about what
week to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to run, depending on what
strain you're running, if you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie stomper, go nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the cream, go 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single week, so start on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean out the reservoir, put in fresh
water, add your nutrients, pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust it like you're supposed to,
start feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of week one, maybe Sunday night
or Monday morning, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: top off the water throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add water to it, adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday night or Monday morning,
dump everything out, scrub it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a product called Fizan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use bleach in the reservoir
unless you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either Fizan or H2O2 is what I would use
to clean that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear proper personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use H2O2, wear gloves
and a face mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dilute the H2O2 with a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will fuck your skin up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll burn you, but it will clean
everything very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fizan, I recommend the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put some water in that Fizan,
put like 15 to 30 mils or put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: water in your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put somewhere between 15 and 25 mils of
the Fizan per gallon of water into the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir and then turn on a pump and stir
it through the pump and whatever and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just scrub the shit out of that reservoir
and then dump that and then let it dry or
[SPEAKER_00]: hand dry it however you need to do it and
then refill it and then remix the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that every week because if you look at
the feed chart that came with your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, there's probably a weekly
flowering schedule that changes every
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start on week one a flower
and go week two, week three, week four,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every week it'll be a different feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just dump it out, clean it with Fizan,
clean it with H2O2, dry it, refill it,
[SPEAKER_00]: remix it, readjust the pH, check the
temperature, start feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix it up on Wednesday or on
Monday, when you get home from work
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday, check the pH, check the temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get home from wherever you're
going Wednesday, check the pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: check the temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If water needs to be added, if you're
running out of water, add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you add water, adjust the pH because
every time you add water, the pH is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the water evaporates, the pH is going
to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your nutrients are made out of salt most
likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the nutrients we use are salt
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: The salt is not going to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is going to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pH is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your PPMs are going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of water evaporation will
change the dilutions and concentrations of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to affect your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I would definitely say
about hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and keep it clean because clean
is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I would clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use the Fizan or H2O2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person goes on to say, anyhow,
sorry for hashtag we like it when you
[SPEAKER_00]: ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ramble at me because you got me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what a podcast is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one guy talking into a microphone,
staring at his computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stare into this computer like a
madman and talk to it like it's a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I look down at this paper and
read occasionally, but it's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep you rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, oh, it would absolutely make
my year so far for some answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get mids out of my droves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so it's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's the temperature probably causing
you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like your feed schedule may
be off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are arguing about which week,
send me another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did not correct your question about
which week correctly, send me a more
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed email and we'll get that dialed
in for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he wraps up the message by saying
love from Tert McGirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, I'm not really looking to
get this on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just very much respect your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking for genuine advice as I
have to be discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate the respect and trust in
letting me help with your garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: trusting in me to get your garden back on
track and helping you get what you need
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I can help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to switch grow stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to find a new place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to start reading shit
online and quit asking at the grow store
[SPEAKER_00]: and start shopping through Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they're sketched on you,
you should be sketched on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm just paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also sent a bunch of cool pictures,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garden looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give the pictures another look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only printed out the text part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows me that the pictures are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not print them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at them on my iPad and see what
they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody that sent me an
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that sent me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize how much of a Twitter
following I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of Twitter interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three or four Twitter accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Rasta Jeff 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's I read genetics and
there's the one I prefer you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow from your heart podcast,
Twitter feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize the Twitter audience I
have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to interact with
you guys a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've been having fun on Instagram
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said earlier, I'm not on there
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done one or two, maybe three
Instagram videos in the past few days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come home from work and get myself
situated and take a couple of fat dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: with my friends on Instagram live and just
ramble like a fool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let people ask grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good chance to ask a question live.
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a response from me right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the people that are
checking me out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't follow me on Instagram,
you should now because you may get to
[SPEAKER_00]: interact and have your questions answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at I read underscore genetics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm over here shamelessly plugging
my social media, we've done Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I prefer emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emails are the easiest way to interact
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply grow from your heart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a lot of emails, but I am working
my way through the pile and printing them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stacking them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just working my way through as I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel frustrated if you've sent me an
email and I haven't read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may pop up in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may pop up in the distant future,
but I will try to get through all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat burns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't answer every question on one
episode, but I appreciate the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep the emails coming please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to everyone who has sent me
an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that I've put up 100 episodes
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are at least 100 episodes up on
YouTube by the time this comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making the video slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ties up my computer for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've rancored about that before,
but there are YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the podcast where I
remind you about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you felt like this podcast was worth a
couple of bucks, you can contribute by
[SPEAKER_00]: going to patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get rich off of
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if it were an option,
I would go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody out there wants to replace my
income from working with the grows or
[SPEAKER_00]: doing whatever, and you want to pay me
that income to podcast, I promise you five
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes every week, plus a throwback
Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, I'm not trying to get rich off of
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love podcasting to help you guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did all the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I killed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I killed clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I had success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took great pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of making you guys struggle
and kill a bunch of shit to get there,
[SPEAKER_00]: waste a bunch of time and energy,
I've already done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd give you some guidance and
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking for anything, but a few
people out there did want to contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started a Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'd like to be a part of it,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to wrap up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go and make sure that the
throwback Thursday episode that I put up
[SPEAKER_00]: has finally gotten to Stitcher because
I've gotten a couple of messages saying
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go make sure it finally went
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reposted it right before I recorded
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it takes Stitcher an hour or two
to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go make sure it pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody that listens on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have usually been doing pretty well on
the Stitcher rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week I fell off quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because the Thursday episode
did not post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only put out half the amount of content
that people rely on me for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be another episode coming up
in the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were looking for that, I hope you
got to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for Stitcher not grabbing
the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for not noticing sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends for pointing that
out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I want to thank everybody for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a throwback Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also be back Monday with brand new
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check me out on Instagram
Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the questions and interactions
that come from Instagram Live will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually end up becoming podcast material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never know what could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a
huge shout out to my friend Tip Top Magoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit, roster Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
