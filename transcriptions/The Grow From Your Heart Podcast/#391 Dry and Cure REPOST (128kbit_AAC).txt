[SPEAKER_00]: with a PL grow minder unit So check out my
friends at PL grow systems at PL grow dot
[SPEAKER_00]: systems one more order of business A lot
of people let me know that the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: with dad and granny and giddy up and max
had an audio issue Ladies and gentlemen
[SPEAKER_00]: that audio issue has been corrected if you

[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you to Go back and check out the
corrected audio version of that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being patient with me and big
Thanks to everybody who let me know there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a technical issue And speaking of
technical issues, I am still working with
[SPEAKER_00]: stitcher to resolve the technical issues
that happen randomly some episodes will
[SPEAKER_00]: play for some people some episodes
randomly will not play for people the only
[SPEAKER_00]: people experiencing the technical issues
are people who are listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast through the stitcher application
on an Android device Sometimes it works
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it doesn't I'm not sure what's
causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we had it narrowed down We
corrected a couple of things it has done
[SPEAKER_00]: it again I will keep working at getting
that resolved if you can't listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes through stitcher through the
application You can always go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stitcher website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the show there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can find the show on YouTube I'm
trying to keep all the episodes updated on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if stitcher is fighting you
I am working on it the tech team and the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer support team at stitcher are
Helping me and we cannot find the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I feel like I've gotten most of
the technical business out of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into a podcast ladies and
gentlemen, you know, I like to start the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes off by letting you know what I am
smoking on Today, I've got the honor of
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing some sauce made by a friend This
was locally grown and locally extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy doesn't want to be mentioned on
the show So I'm not gonna say his name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but dude, thanks for the great work My
friend grew some cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I bred the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cream is cookies and cream to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I passed along some seeds He grew it he
harvested it he extracted and made sauce
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it Then he was kind enough to bring
me a couple of sample jars and you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff is Tremendous it's almost gone
because it is so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought me a little sample of straight
isolated crystals He brought me a little
[SPEAKER_00]: sample of straight isolated turps and he
also brought me a sample of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: combined So I've got the turps I've got
the crystals and then I've got the saucy
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture put together at a beautiful ratio
you guys the mixture smells like Cupcake
[SPEAKER_00]: frosting and cookie dough and then when
you take a dab of it It tastes like you
[SPEAKER_00]: just took a big bite of cookie dough with
cupcake frosting on it And then when you
[SPEAKER_00]: blow it out, it smells like somebody's
baking fresh cookies in the room It smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like warm chocolate chip and cinnamon
cookies filling the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate is excellent It is super
smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple of gigantic dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no throat tingle There was no
heaviness on the exhale super smooth super
[SPEAKER_00]: clean super delicious concentrates,
dude I know you don't want Me to say your
[SPEAKER_00]: name on the air, but great product great
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a hell of a job with this This
stuff tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is that it is almost gone
I've probably got one or two dabs before
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff is extinct So bro come back
with a bigger jar and let's uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's make a deal Alright you guys I am
obviously loving these cream dabs grown
[SPEAKER_00]: and extracted by a local farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, great work I truly do appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this episode is gonna be really
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got all of the opening business
covered I'm gonna press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a dab probably the last two
dabs of this cream and when I get back I
[SPEAKER_00]: will give a long lesson on drying and
curing your freshly harvested cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants All right podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well medicated I am well hydrated and
I am ready to talk about drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: your freshly harvested cannabis plants Now
let me do a quick update from the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about harvesting your plants We
talked about cutting them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about hanging them in a room
upside down In a climate controlled room
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing I failed to mention you should
only hang one crop in a space at a time to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent re-moisturizing the first crop
Don't cut down one crop and then let it
[SPEAKER_00]: hang for four or five days Five or seven
days and then bring in a fresh crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: lock that in the same room because what
you're doing is just introducing a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of moisture into that room and it's
just going to go into the other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to re-moisten the other
plants and make them take longer and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to kind of restart your dry and
cure process so one one crop at a time is
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal hanging in the room that's something
I should have mentioned on the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: before and I didn't remember to mention
that so now we are up to speed now let's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get into drying and curing our
freshly harvested cannabis plants now
[SPEAKER_00]: after spending four weeks in veg eight to
ten weeks in flour you really don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to mess these plants up at the very end
here curing is a very critical process
[SPEAKER_00]: curing you can make the most delicious
buds taste like total shit from drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing them improperly you can ruin the
entire crop at this point don't get too
[SPEAKER_00]: scared because I'm going to guide you
through not ruining it but keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is one of the most critical
parts in the growing process this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge process and a lot of things can go
wrong if you don't pay attention so take
[SPEAKER_00]: your time and pay attention and don't rush
to smoke your new crop you've waited what
[SPEAKER_00]: what do we say about 14 weeks probably is
what we did the math on a hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty days you've grown these plants for
a hundred and twenty days is about how
[SPEAKER_00]: long it takes why not wait a couple of
days longer until they are perfect before
[SPEAKER_00]: you start smoking it so let's get it
actually drying and curing these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: now the last grow episode was a harvest
episode and it left us with our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging upside down in a room with proper
temps proper humidity and minimal light
[SPEAKER_00]: now we've been waiting for the sticks for
our plants to snap we've got plants
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging upside down they've been de-leaved
we're just waiting for the right humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plants for the sticks to pop
the sticks should snap we're waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to snap but not explode when you grab
a branch of the plant and you just bend it
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it to sound kind of like that you
don't want it to go you don't want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: explode with dryness you don't want it to
fall apart and you don't want it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: gummy or rubbery or bendy you don't want
it to bend you want it to snap and pop so
[SPEAKER_00]: the sticks should snap the bigger sticks
and larger plants are going to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit longer the skinnier sticks and
smaller plants are obviously going to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly because they don't hold as
much moisture also if you took off less
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf or more leaf they're going to dry
more quickly without the leaf and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take a little longer with that
extra leaf on there because it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold more moisture there'll be more
moisture in the room just more moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: overall to deal with so we're waiting for
is those sticks to snap when the stick
[SPEAKER_00]: snap that's when the container curing
process begins I use two different methods
[SPEAKER_00]: for this based on crop size don't forget
that I run commercial grows in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial setting we do things a little
differently than we would do in a home
[SPEAKER_00]: setting I'm used to pulling down 50 or
more pounds in a commercial environment
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want a bunch of jars you don't
really have the space for a bunch of jars
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have the manpower to open a
bunch of jars all day so we do things a
[SPEAKER_00]: little differently in a home grow it's not
as many pounds it's less jars so I use jar
[SPEAKER_00]: technique in a home grow but let's talk
about the way I would do it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow in a commercial grow I'll
chop the large stock and naked stems out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants and place the buds still on
sticks into large rubber made containers
[SPEAKER_00]: so you've got a big plant you've lolly
popped up probably 12 to 18 inches of it
[SPEAKER_00]: so you've got some naked sticks right
that's what I mean by naked sticks the the
[SPEAKER_00]: shaved legs and that main big stock I'll
cut all of that out and that goes to waste
[SPEAKER_00]: in a commercial grow that's actually got
to be weighed and documented as removed
[SPEAKER_00]: waste so now I've got two piles one pile
is naked sticks that need to be documented
[SPEAKER_00]: as waste they'll be chipped up and thrown
away then there's another pile that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: usable product of the sticks with buds up
it they need to be trimmed those buds
[SPEAKER_00]: still on the sticks get put into the
rubber made containers untrimmed now
[SPEAKER_00]: here's something to keep in mind carefully
label your rubber made containers do not
[SPEAKER_00]: label the lids never label lids in a
facility in a home grow don't label the
[SPEAKER_00]: lids lids are interchangeable label the
container so chop the sticks out put the
[SPEAKER_00]: good usable buds into the rubber made
container don't squish them in their too
[SPEAKER_00]: tight fill it up pretty well but don't
cram anything in there you need some air
[SPEAKER_00]: space in there and you don't want to smash
anything and if it's too tightly pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: together it'll get funky it'll start to
smell bad moisture will get trapped in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and you'll start to get that stale
ammonia smell and that's what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to avoid with proper drying and
curing so I would go through and remove
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the sticks get all the good buds
into the containers and then once they are
[SPEAKER_00]: all completed I would go through and put
the lids on every container at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have everything labeled it all be
sitting open and then when we're done with
[SPEAKER_00]: every plant that's going to get been that
day that's when I start putting the lids
[SPEAKER_00]: on and sealing up the containers now I
feel like I haven't described these
[SPEAKER_00]: containers properly these rubber made
containers are like the size of maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: laundry basket they're about three feet
wide I guess and then maybe a foot or so
[SPEAKER_00]: wide I know I said wide but three feet
long and a foot or so wide and then
[SPEAKER_00]: probably about 18 maybe 20 inches deep
they're the one that you use for packing
[SPEAKER_00]: or you just put a bunch of clothes in
there just a bunch of bullshit or it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: one when the kids come to the front door
and they're trying to sell candy for
[SPEAKER_00]: church like I got some candy for church
there would you like to raise some money
[SPEAKER_00]: and they got the big rubber made container
that's the container I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just like a moving box or something
is what it looks like a storage container
[SPEAKER_00]: we can fit three or four large plants in
those containers from the commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: so I guess I should have mentioned that a
little earlier but it just dawned on me
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did not describe these containers
in any way so now let's talk more about
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens to these plants once they are
put into this container and the lid is put
[SPEAKER_00]: on them they need to be opened and rotated
every day until they're dry enough to seal
[SPEAKER_00]: up without risking any mold development
the first day is always scary when you
[SPEAKER_00]: seal them up and then leave overnight that
is always a scary feeling until you get
[SPEAKER_00]: there the next day don't be afraid to
leave them open if you feel like they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little too moist if you cut them down and
get them in the bin and realize ah shit a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of these are too wet don't be
afraid to leave those open overnight you
[SPEAKER_00]: would rather leave them open and get them
a little too dry then close them up and
[SPEAKER_00]: get them a little funky a little funky
doesn't go away a little too dry we can
[SPEAKER_00]: work with so you seal them up you put the
lids on them and then you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: check on them before you leave for the day
make sure that nothing needs to be rotated
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing needs to be flipped around nothing
needs to be left open like I said if it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be left open leave it open don't
be afraid then you're gonna leave you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna come back the next day you're gonna
have a bunch of sealed containers they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be popped open immediately I would
pop them open for four maybe six maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: seven hours and check on them while they
were sealed a lot of the moisture that was
[SPEAKER_00]: inside those sticks reconstituted
throughout those buds and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture built up in that container you're
gonna find a lot of spongy and wet buds
[SPEAKER_00]: when you come in in the morning that's
expected don't worry it'll be okay you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna leave it open and get some of that
shit out of there that's the idea you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to open it up every day and let that stuff
out of there when they start getting dry
[SPEAKER_00]: again some of the sticks might not even
snap again some of them may have
[SPEAKER_00]: re-moistened to where they don't snap that
that means you may have gone just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit too early but it's not bad because we
can get that moisture out you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to get too dry so you're gonna pop them
open you're gonna see how wet they are
[SPEAKER_00]: leave them open you may just want to leave
them open for an hour if they're real dry
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour is fine four to six hours is not
uncommon on the first day if you chop
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants down or if you bend those
plants a little bit too early they may be
[SPEAKER_00]: really wet and you may have to leave them
open for four to six maybe the whole shift
[SPEAKER_00]: of eight to ten hours they may have to
stay open that's not uncommon try not to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut them down and put them into the bins
so early next time but you'll be okay this
[SPEAKER_00]: is something you're gonna have to dial in
with your facility and with your technique
[SPEAKER_00]: so the duration of burp time is going to
decrease slowly as the buds dry these bins
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to sit in a room ideally that is
at 50% humidity and 70 degrees until you
[SPEAKER_00]: have time to trim them I run a humidifier
and a dehumidifier at the same time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're both set at 50% humidity so if
that room gets to 55% humidity that
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier kicks on immediately if it
gets to 45% the humidifier comes on
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately I don't get out of that 10
degree range and it stays pretty close
[SPEAKER_00]: with both of those machines and they're
fighting each other they pretty much just
[SPEAKER_00]: stay on all the time so I've got these
buds they are in containers they have not
[SPEAKER_00]: been trimmed yet and they still need to be
burped on a daily basis the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry and cure manager or the trim team
manager should do when they get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is pop open these bins and see what
type of situation you've got they should
[SPEAKER_00]: be getting drier and more smokable and
they should start smelling more like daint
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis every day that fresh green wet
smell should be going away but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to pop them every day and
pay attention to how long they need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: open like I said that first day you're
gonna get four to six hours maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: second day four to six hours maybe the
third day four hours maybe the fourth day
[SPEAKER_00]: three hours then maybe you're just gonna
have to pop them open for an hour every
[SPEAKER_00]: day and see what's going on and check it
out eventually you won't have to open them
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore once you've gotten them to about
65% humidity inside the container
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently you don't have to burp it
that is cured where you want it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also in that room with 50% humidity so
it's gonna stay about 50% humidity and it
[SPEAKER_00]: won't get less than that and they can the
containers hold moisture in there so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna stay above 50% trust me so while
you're drying and curing inside those bins
[SPEAKER_00]: be sure to burp the bins every day and
rotate the buds to prevent mold and funky
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas until they get dry enough to leave
alone don't be afraid to take the buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: pick them up right outside of the
container and flip them over and set it
[SPEAKER_00]: back in so all the buds that were on the
bottom are now on the top and do that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do that once or twice a day if you
feel like you need to if they are really
[SPEAKER_00]: wet something I want to keep stressing is
if they are too moist don't be afraid to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the lid off the containers until the
buds are nice and dry and you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable closing them up and you're
sure there's not going to get any mold in
[SPEAKER_00]: there because if you leave it closed for
too long or you've been these buds too
[SPEAKER_00]: early you're going to create an ammonia
type funky terrible smell inside your buds
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to burn well they're
gonna taste terrible they're gonna smell
[SPEAKER_00]: funky and it's not gonna be desirable and
you're not gonna be able to sell it at
[SPEAKER_00]: your dispensary or however you plan on
selling it so one problem you may run into
[SPEAKER_00]: if you leave it closed too long is funky
aromas the only thing you can do to fix
[SPEAKER_00]: that is try to air it out just leave it
open let it dry try to let that smell go
[SPEAKER_00]: away and it's probably not going to you've
probably gone too long so make sure not to
[SPEAKER_00]: seal it up for too long and make sure not
to seal it up when it's too moist another
[SPEAKER_00]: problem you could run into during the
drying and curing process is the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: could get too dry if your buds get too dry
in those containers a trick you can do is
[SPEAKER_00]: to go pull a few leaves from your growing
plants if you've got a flower room you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably need to defoliate a little bit
and pull some plant pull some leaves off
[SPEAKER_00]: those flowering plants anyway so go get I
would say four to six large leaves per
[SPEAKER_00]: Rubbermaid container is more than enough
to rehydrate some semi-dry buds in one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those containers we tried to put too much
in there and it made it really wet really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly so four to six leaves is more than
enough to re-moisten an entire Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_00]: container if you left it open just a
little bit too long if you got it down
[SPEAKER_00]: into that Colorado crunch zone then you've
done fucked up and you might not be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to fix it but we'll talk about that a
little bit later in the episode but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't go too far just grab four or five
maybe six leaves throw them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: container and seal it up for just a few
hours then go check on it that moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: will reconstitute the buds and give you a
second chance I would not recommend using
[SPEAKER_00]: anything other than cannabis leaves maybe
Boveda packs however you like to say it
[SPEAKER_00]: the Boveda packs come at 62% humidity you
can use those if you'd like although I do
[SPEAKER_00]: not prefer them myself I think they make a
weird flavor in my cannabis buds I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that using the leaves of the same plant is
the best idea all right so that is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the commercial grow version of
drying and curing your cannabis plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: a large scale now I'm going to take a
giant dab and when we get back we will
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about drying and curing your cannabis
on a smaller scale for the home grower
[SPEAKER_00]: all right podcast well let's get back into
this dry and cure episode the home grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: the connoisseur version of drying and
curing your final product is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different than the commercial grow version
but it's basically the same idea we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to slow down the drying process we want to
get those buds to feel nice and sticky we
[SPEAKER_00]: want them to smell nice and sweet we want
to burn nice and smooth so this is how I
[SPEAKER_00]: would dry and cure my product in a small
connoisseur batch in a smaller grow a home
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or a boutique grow or maybe something
I was going to enter into a competition if
[SPEAKER_00]: this was going into a cup this is how I
would cure my product the main difference
[SPEAKER_00]: is that I would not be using the gigantic
rubber made containers I would use quart
[SPEAKER_00]: size wide mouth glass jars I don't want to
use bigger jars I feel like maybe too much
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture gets stuck in there you have the
same conditions that you create in those
[SPEAKER_00]: rubber made containers I like the smaller
more focused jars another note before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get too far make sure you label each jar
if you're working with more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: strain label the jars not the lids lids
are interchangeable be careful with this
[SPEAKER_00]: please if you're working with different
phenotypes label the jar whatever arise
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype 2 arise phenotype 3 if you're
running a pack of seeds or whatever label
[SPEAKER_00]: the jars so that you know what you're
working with basically everything up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point of the sticks snapping is the
same we're waiting for the sticks to snap
[SPEAKER_00]: once the stick snap that's when we can
start the jar curing process for jar tech
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take the snappy sticks and chop
off every bud into a bucket just get all
[SPEAKER_00]: those buds off the sticks into the bucket
throw those sticks away get rid of them do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you do with them compost them
shred them up toss them those are done
[SPEAKER_00]: then I hand trim the buds I'll do another
episode all about hand trimming the buds I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like trim machines and I don't like
wet trim but I'll talk about that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming episode that is coming up so I
trim the buds they should be dry enough by
[SPEAKER_00]: now to knock off most of the leaves with
your thumbs and thumbnails so trim them up
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty closely with your thumb then put
the trimmed buds into the glass jars that
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about the wide mouth quart size
mason jars fill those jars about 75 to 90
[SPEAKER_00]: percent full if your buds are fluffier if
your buds are bigger you're only going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to get 75 percent in there because
of all the airspace I get it in makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense if you've got smaller buds you can
put up to 90 percent in there but do not
[SPEAKER_00]: press them down into the jar and don't
over pack them and don't squish them in
[SPEAKER_00]: you just want them lightly sitting in
there now once the jar is full I add the
[SPEAKER_00]: lid and I set a timer I like to check my
buds about four hours after being sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: up for the first time this first check
lets me see how much moisture is trapped
[SPEAKER_00]: in my buds if the inside of the jar is
extremely humid I'll just leave that lid
[SPEAKER_00]: off for an hour or more in the commercial
grow we were talking about four to six
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe eight hours maybe even ten hours
those are much larger plants much larger
[SPEAKER_00]: batches and much larger containers there
is much more moisture in there so for
[SPEAKER_00]: these smaller jars I only want to leave it
off for a little bit at a time these
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller batches can get away from you
quite quickly so pay more attention so
[SPEAKER_00]: open it up see how humid it is if it's
really humid and really squishy you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna want to leave it open for an hour
maybe a little bit more just keep checking
[SPEAKER_00]: on it and do not forget about it set
another timer if the humidity has not made
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds squishy again I'll leave the jar
open for only like 15 to 30 minutes to let
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture out and that old funky air
out of the jar and then it'll kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: refresh with fresh air in there then I'll
reseal the jar and let it sit for another
[SPEAKER_00]: four to six hours I set a timer for this
then in four to six hours I pop that jar
[SPEAKER_00]: and I gently stir the buds around and
check the aroma that comes out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm looking for when I smell is an
aroma of ammonia or funk or just you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: notice it your nose will crinkle up and
your eyes will make a weird squint you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go fuck I fucked up I'm looking for that
aroma I'm hoping that's not present it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be also I'm looking to see if it
smells less wet has it gone from that wet
[SPEAKER_00]: juicy hay smell to more of that cured
chronic smell that I'm looking for because
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll start doing it quickly and then it
will improve over time so I'm cracking the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar open I'm looking to see how much
humidity is in there I stir them around if
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds seem damp or extra spongy at this
point I'll dump them out of the jar and
[SPEAKER_00]: let them sit for a few minutes until that
excess moisture evaporates you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds super soggy and sealed in a jar
you don't want the buds super wet and
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed together in a jar if they still
feel wet and spongy on the outside I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: dump them out and let them sit out for a
few minutes until they feel dry on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside but when you squeeze them they're
mushy still a little bit you just want
[SPEAKER_00]: them dry on the outside wet on the inside
is what you're going for at this point if
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds are sticking together then I dump
them out completely and let them dry more
[SPEAKER_00]: before putting them back in now we want a
little bit of moisture in these buds the
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of moisture is going to make
the drying and curing process happen but
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want enough moisture to cause
mold and funk so we burp the jar about
[SPEAKER_00]: every four hours to make sure we don't
seal too much water in the jar for too
[SPEAKER_00]: long we let some of the curing process
happen by opening the jar letting that old
[SPEAKER_00]: gas out that contains the chlorophyll that
contains the sugars that gas evaporates
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the jar we replace it with fresh
air we seal it back up then when we seal
[SPEAKER_00]: it it's allowed to restart the curing
process it'll start deteriorating and
[SPEAKER_00]: eating up more of that chlorophyll more of
those excess minerals and sugars inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: there and they will start evaporating out
of your buds you'll get them out so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: get back on track here after the first
couple of days you can slowly increase
[SPEAKER_00]: your burp intervals as the buds get drier
you may only need to open these jars up
[SPEAKER_00]: every six to eight hours after a little
bit and the time that you leave them open
[SPEAKER_00]: will also decrease so maybe after a few
days you pop it open every eight hours
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you pop it open right before you go
to work you leave it open while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: brushing your teeth and getting your shoes
on and then you close it up and you leave
[SPEAKER_00]: you come back from work and then you pop
it open it's probably been ten hours by
[SPEAKER_00]: now pop it open again stir the buds around
make sure nothing's gone funky if
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing's gone funky just leave it open
for five minutes let that air exchange in
[SPEAKER_00]: there seal it right back up then you can
go ten hours and you know you're safe at
[SPEAKER_00]: ten hours see what happens at 11 hours see
what happens at 12 hours just start
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching it every day by the end of two
weeks you'll just be popping these jars
[SPEAKER_00]: open once a day you'll check it out you'll
give it a good smell and you'll say that
[SPEAKER_00]: is so close and then you can close it back
up by the end of two weeks these buds will
[SPEAKER_00]: be beautifully beautifully cured so the
bud should be sticky on the outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: spongy but not dry and crumbly they should
almost have a little bit of squeeze a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of give to them and then stick
to your fingers they shouldn't fall apart
[SPEAKER_00]: and just crumble up like a lot of the
Colorado dispensary bud does unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: and the reason for that you guys is
because it's sitting on the shelf out
[SPEAKER_00]: there all day they're opening up those
jars and showing it to you all day that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is just getting dry so that's the
problem with the Colorado crunch I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize for that the growers work hard
to get it proper and then it's sent to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and left in those jars and the
bud tenders don't do us justice so I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize so on day one I chopped the buds
off the sticks and I trim them up then I
[SPEAKER_00]: fill the jars about 90% full then I seal
the jar I check the jar in about four
[SPEAKER_00]: hours I open it long enough for the excess
moisture to come out of the jar that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little while that could be a short
amount of time it kind of depends on how
[SPEAKER_00]: wet the buds were when you jarred them up
then I check it again in about four hours
[SPEAKER_00]: I shuffle the buds if I feel that's
necessary it's likely necessary then I
[SPEAKER_00]: check again in four to six hours and leave
open as necessary if they're getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky again I'll dump them out you'll
want to check as soon as you wake up the
[SPEAKER_00]: next day the burp process will slow down
over the next few days you want it to take
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as possible without allowing
mildew to develop you want to slow it down
[SPEAKER_00]: the longer it takes the better the more
time that it takes for that moisture to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out the more opportunity you have for
chlorophyll to be removed the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about very similarly to the
Rubbermaid technique is trapping too much
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in your containers for too long
and causing yourself mildew or funky
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors if you locked your buds up in
these jars long enough to where you got
[SPEAKER_00]: like white mold the webbing growing on
there and it looks like some cotton coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out you fucked up and didn't pay any
attention throw that away if your jar is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get an ammonia smell you've
sealed it up too long you've got to open
[SPEAKER_00]: it more frequently and longer next time
you may be able to save it but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unlikely the only thing you can do is
leave it open and let it dry out and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully that smell will go away so don't
leave it closed too long don't let mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: happen don't let that funky smell happen
once you're past the first few days you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of be out of the mildew danger zone
but still be careful also keep your jars
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cool dark place while you're curing
your buds but also don't leave them
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere where you're going to forget
about them also here in Colorado I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: running a swamp cooler in the main portion
the living area of my house don't go dump
[SPEAKER_00]: your buds on the table near the swamp
cooler this is not going to do you any
[SPEAKER_00]: good this is going to reconstitute them
and make them wetter think about wetter is
[SPEAKER_00]: that a word anyway think about the
environment where you were drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing your products if you're going to
dump them out on the table in an attempt
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them more dry make sure that the
room is drier than the bud or it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work just keep that kind of stuff
in mind you guys think about your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment think about your products so I
feel like we've got a basic understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of how to cure our buds now let's get into
the technical talk about why we do it and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's technically happening so curing
your buds properly makes your buds burn
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoke smoothly and it also brings out
the best flavors and aromas proper drying
[SPEAKER_00]: and curing will also increase your potency
now why why does that happen because your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds contain chlorophyll chlorophyll is
what gives your buds that harsh smoke and
[SPEAKER_00]: hay-like flavor that burn your throat kind
of funky flavor that's from too much
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll that's from excess minerals in
the plant that could also be from an
[SPEAKER_00]: improper flush but it's usually from an
improper cure so curing the buds will
[SPEAKER_00]: remove chlorophyll and increase your
potency at the same time the only way to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove chlorophyll is by turning it into a
gas sealing our moist buds in a jar
[SPEAKER_00]: creates an environment that will break
down the chlorophyll and turn it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: gas darkness moisture and oxygen will
create a bacteria within the jar that
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria will break down the sugars and
leftover minerals created by the
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition of the chlorophyll and it
will turn into a vapor that can escape the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar when you pop it open that was what I
was talking about earlier when I said we
[SPEAKER_00]: pop open the jar and let the chemical
reaction happen now this process is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make your bud burn smoother it's going
to take make it taste better it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring out the proper aromas the proper
terpene profile that you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's also going to increase the
overall potency of your finished product
[SPEAKER_00]: now if you really want to nerd out and
dial this in and create a connoisseur
[SPEAKER_00]: product find yourself a hygrometer that
fits inside of your mason jar there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple available that fit right inside the
mason jar you can press it up to the front
[SPEAKER_00]: of the jars where you can read the display
without opening the jar find yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: hygrometers that will fit in the jar and
here are some suggestions on when to open
[SPEAKER_00]: and close your jars and how to dial them
in perfectly if your buds feel wet or if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are above 70% humidity if the little
display on that hygrometer inside of your
[SPEAKER_00]: jar reads above 70% humidity you need to
dump those buds out of the jar and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them dry until they get to 65 to 70%
humidity now when you dump them out and
[SPEAKER_00]: you leave them somewhere that's not by the
fan that's not by the swamp cooler that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not by the air conditioner that's not by
something that's going to drastically
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the rate of their drying don't
forget about them set a timer and go find
[SPEAKER_00]: them some of you are a little obsessive
you're definitely not going to forget some
[SPEAKER_00]: of you are going to take a couple of dabs
and go play fortnight and your buds are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to dry up to shit don't let that
happen you guys so if they are too humid
[SPEAKER_00]: dump them out let them dry out a little
bit get them down to 65 to 70% humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: now if your buds feel moist to the touch
if they're sticky and wet to the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the buds and the display reads 65 to
70% humidity pop the lid off of that jar
[SPEAKER_00]: for 15 to 30 minutes and let a little
moisture evaporate out if you think they
[SPEAKER_00]: need longer than 15 to 30 minutes let them
go longer but like I said don't start
[SPEAKER_00]: playing fortnight and start building shit
and shooting people and forget about them
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't want them to get too
crunchy so 15 to 30 maybe 45 minutes maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour seal them back up set yourself a
timer to remember to check on them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and now you can go play
fortnight and relax now your goal is 60 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 percent humidity you want that
hygrometer to read between 60 and 65
[SPEAKER_00]: percent humidity and you want them dry but
not crunchy they're going to feel squishy
[SPEAKER_00]: and sticky hopefully but they're not wet
you just want them dry but not crunchy you
[SPEAKER_00]: might need to let your buds sit out for a
little bit before you roll a joint if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cured perfectly the display will say 60 to
65 percent you may need to take a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of buds out of there and set them I just
set them right here on the front of my
[SPEAKER_00]: computer if I'm gonna roll when it's a
little warmer right there just let them
[SPEAKER_00]: chill they're not like in the path of the
fan or anything just let them chill right
[SPEAKER_00]: here that's what I'm gonna roll a joint
within a few minutes and just let them sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there you know just just for a little bit
just maybe if I'm gonna go to lunch and
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and smoke a joint I'll set them
out right before I go to lunch and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to lunch and then you come back and
then they grind up nice and fine and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still sticky they're still juicy
and then your joint burns super smoothly
[SPEAKER_00]: and if your joints not burning super
smooth then you probably have too much
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in there and you got to let it
dry and cure just a little bit longer now
[SPEAKER_00]: if you hit that 55 percent or lower mark
you're entering what I call the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: crunch area and your buds are gonna burn
too fast and you're also losing weight if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with more than a quarter
pound there and you're drying it up you
[SPEAKER_00]: risk losing you know a quarter of an ounce
or whatever depends on how much you let it
[SPEAKER_00]: dry so if your buds get too dry don't add
anything funky to rehydrate them the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I would use are fresh cannabis
leaves and a little bit goes a long way so
[SPEAKER_00]: take them out when the moisture comes back
and don't let those leaves mold up in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and fuck up your crop check on them
frequently if you put wet leaves inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: either your curing jar or your packs or
your fucking turkey bags however you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you take them out and don't
leave them for too long check on them
[SPEAKER_00]: after an hour one hour is more than enough
go check on it set yourself a timer don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get stuck doing an Instagram live video
and forget to check on your buds all right
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's gonna take a little bit for your
hygrometer to measure the humidity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar but it's gonna get you a pretty good
idea of when to open and close those jars
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's gonna give you some actual data
to go by you'll be able to squeeze those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds and feel how wet they are and you'll
be able to compare that number or that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture to the number on the hygrometer
and you'll go oh that's what 65% feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's what Jeff's trying to get me
to so that gives you something to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with it's a little bit of a cheater but if
you're using one hygrometer you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to seal it into the jar for a few
minutes and wait for it to get to where it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be now if it's jumping real fast
go ahead and pull it out leave that jar
[SPEAKER_00]: open that means it's really humid in there
and that you're just gonna seal it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: cause problems all right so we've got a
little tiny hygrometer in our jars we're
[SPEAKER_00]: watching the numbers we're trying to get
ourselves to 60 to 65 percent humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of those jars make sure you don't
forget about your buds make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get that funky aroma in there make sure it
doesn't smell like ammonia and mildew make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you don't ruin it you should be
paying attention to the number on the
[SPEAKER_00]: hygrometer and then pulling some buds out
and seeing what they feel like so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what 50 what 60 what 70 what 80
percent humidity if you get to 80 you
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up but so that you know what the
percentage of humidity feels like inside
[SPEAKER_00]: these jars what the bud feels like this
will give you a really good idea start
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention to that stuff and you
will get ahead of the drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: game now once you've gotten your buds
dried and cured to 55 to 65 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and you don't see any fluctuation
inside that jar on the hygrometer you only
[SPEAKER_00]: need to crack them open to check on them
or pull out some buds to smoke you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to keep popping those jars open
they're gonna get too dry if you do that
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can trap the moisture in there
leave it right at that point and your bud
[SPEAKER_00]: will be perfectly cured for whenever you
need it now i've said before that i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like the boveda packs but they work if you
do fuck up the boveda packs i would buy
[SPEAKER_00]: are the 62 percent and you can just drop
them right inside your jar it'll help
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstitute that package or that jar and
then sometimes i feel like they leave kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a watery flavor on the buds but i guess
i'd rather have a properly cured bud that
[SPEAKER_00]: has that aroma than some colorado crunch
that's just gonna burn up when i light my
[SPEAKER_00]: joint at the show so ladies and gentlemen
that is my dry and cure episode i want to
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you guys for listening if you have

[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again so there are things
like that that do need to be covered and i
