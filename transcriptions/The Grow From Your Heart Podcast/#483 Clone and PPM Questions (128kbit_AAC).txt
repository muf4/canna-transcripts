[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 483 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of black and
blue live batter from green.ly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of blue cheese and HSB.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, the flavor is described as
cream cheese, floral, and blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will agree with the floral and
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I got cream cheese in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is definitely a dankness going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a smooth creaminess that I do
enjoy, but this is a great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something about the way that this
batter hit my lungs, it really felt like I
[SPEAKER_00]: got a really fat hit off of a little tiny
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, the label says
the product contains 67.2% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious black and blue live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to answer a
couple of listener emails before I get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to do some shout outs to
our friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big giant Grow From
Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to our friend Tommy.

[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also take a moment to give a
giant shout out to my new friend Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet Matt today face to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to high five and shake each other's
hand, talk about cannabis for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my new buddy Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, at the start of the show,
I did say that I was going to read some
[SPEAKER_00]: listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into the listener email
portion of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question in this episode
actually came from my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a comment left on one of my
videos asking about clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the specific question was,
why, when I see a tray of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: do people often cut the tips of the leaves
off of all of their clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure you've seen this in pictures
or in other grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when we take a tray of
clones or when we fill an easy cloner or
[SPEAKER_00]: an auto-cloner for clones, it is very
common practice to cut most of the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: off of that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also trim the remaining leaves to
be quite short.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I like to do it is I look at the
leaf and at the very fattest point,
[SPEAKER_00]: right where it begins to taper back to
going skinny, I cut it off right there at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning of the taper skinny part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets real wide and as soon as it
tapers, I cut it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need all of that leaf in the
dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need all of that leaf in the
cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone does not need all of that leaf
to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more specifically about why
we cut the edges off the clones when we
[SPEAKER_00]: are cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason is to make it easier for
that clone to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just completely removed that clone from
its life support system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way it's able to survive now is
by what it gathers through the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: through its leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a whole bunch of excessive
foliage on there, that is too much for
[SPEAKER_00]: those leaves to try to support themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to having a root system to
where they can feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to minimize the amount of foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to basically cut the fat so that
plant can survive with the minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that it's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little energy it's got left in that
cut has to become enough energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage that plant to root out and
become a successful clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to cut the fat basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to minimize the amount of leaf
material that that plant is trying to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: alive while keeping enough leaf material
there to actually have a viable clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main reason that I cut the tips off
many of the leaves is just to make less
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage for that plant to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a small life support system,
less foliage, better chance of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason why I like to cut the tips
off of the clone is it just makes more
[SPEAKER_00]: space in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I don't have leaves overlapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When leaves start overlapping,
you get moisture pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an uneven VPD in your cloning
environment and that can lead to problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cutting off those leaf tips gives you
less foliage to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less for that plant to sustain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also gives you a better VPD because
the leaves are not resting on top of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get weird humidity pockets in
some areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have two leaves stuck together,
which always becomes problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If two leaves get real humid and they dry
and they're stuck together, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: never like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants just like space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want somebody's arm resting
across you when you're trying to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: job or when you're trying to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants don't enjoy that sort of
thing either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just give them their space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way we can promote a more
even VPD throughout the cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my main reasons why I clip
the tips of the leaves of my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will find that this is very strain
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the thinner-leaved cultivars won't
respond as well to this as some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger, thicker-leaved cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that is my talk on why I
clip the leaves of my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I will do that if I am using
the easy cloner or if I am using the old
[SPEAKER_00]: school clone dome method.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's jump into the actual
first email for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a cannabis cultivation or a
cannabis culture question, you can send me
[SPEAKER_00]: an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first official email in today's
episode goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey there, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed your episode about mistakes,
but I didn't reply with mine because until
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday they were just the usual type,
like leaving the door open, minor floods,
[SPEAKER_00]: timers set wrong, and adding molasses to
my deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says in parentheses,
overnight death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this email is in response to an episode
I did several episodes back talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: common garden mistakes that I have made,
encouraging other people to admit their
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend here, who calls themselves
Marco Esquindolas, admits that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: made several mistakes in the past,
but nothing worth talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one where they put molasses in the
deep water culture, that is certain death
[SPEAKER_00]: that will make your deep water culture
system all gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you wake up in the
morning, your plants are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a big mistake, but it sounds
like you learned from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person was going to install more
equipment and they just discovered the
[SPEAKER_00]: original gear is in completely backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of pulling the air through the
filter, through a sealed light hood and
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the room, I was pushing outside air
into the hood and through the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I won't need that new blower
and filter after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's probably going to be easier to
cool that room down and keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are pushing air the direction you
thought you were moving the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll make things a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a funny mistake,
kind of an expensive mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went and bought more equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can return that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most grow stores don't let you take shit
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a backup for when you need
to replace the stuff you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the message goes on to say,
I'm embarrassed to admit it took over a
[SPEAKER_00]: month to realize my error.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is embarrassing, but don't feel too
bad that it took you over a month to
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnose that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the hardest problems to diagnose
because we've got different things
[SPEAKER_00]: happening outside all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think we're just fighting that
outside temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why can't I get my grow room cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hot out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think you're actually cooling it
down, but you were bringing in hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand why that could baffle you
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be glad that you've got it fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bad that you went and spent money
on new equipment that you do not need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said before, you've got backup
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need a new blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need a new filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just throw that in the room to
help minimize the aroma on its own and
[SPEAKER_00]: that would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't feel too bad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't beat yourself up over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, as you said, you've got to check
the obvious stuff first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but sometimes the obvious stuff is
not the obvious stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you've just got to struggle
for a month and then you've got to laugh
[SPEAKER_00]: at yourself and make that silly face that
you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to slap yourself in the
forehead and go, oh, that's my problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're able to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got a good mistake and a
good story to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, on a different subject,
I finally got Leonardo to grow some balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a dozen sprays with STS and it's
almost too late for the intended crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to make an S2 just for fun
and preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend Marco Esquindolas here has
got my Leonardo strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have reversed it using silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took longer than expected, which is not
a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that that plant has got solid,
stable genetics that is hard to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a dozen sprays, which is most of
the time it takes seven or eight sprays if
[SPEAKER_00]: you time it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a strong strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a lot to reverse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost too late for the intended crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, timing a reversal is an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some tips I can share with you
in future episodes on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe you can still sprinkle that
pollen and get a few seeds or maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: can just save it for the next run because
it says, wanted to make an S2 just for fun
[SPEAKER_00]: and preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a fun project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions about your feminized
breeding project, maybe we can talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap up the message with,
love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to share, including my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sign it with Marco Esquindolas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also give us their Cannibuz
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on Cannibuz they are Nehe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them a follow on Cannibuz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am familiar with Nehe's great
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Marco Esquindolas, thank you
for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for admitting your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a grow room
mistake they would like to share with us,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep the show
moving with another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message comes from our friend,
Nick, and it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am glad that my seeds are making you
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great attitude and a great
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a lot to do with why I am in the
Cannibuz industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of the first medical marijuana
dispensary in my area, in my city,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got to help a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to help little old ladies who were
dealing with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: and major medical problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to help firefighters who were
injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to help military veterans who'd been
blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a patient who has been in a severe
fire and has burned very badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to make his life better on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to help people of all age ranges and
all walks of life on a daily basis with a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that I grew, and then I got to
sell to them legally over the counter as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that put a huge passion in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I absolutely understand and share this
gratitude that you have got for Cannibuz
[SPEAKER_00]: and for what Cannibuz is doing for your
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back onto this email
because I can ramble about this all day,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great because it goes on to say,
That is funny because I as well have got a
[SPEAKER_00]: head injury and I also ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are friends already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also am very detail oriented in my
grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, That being
said, I do tend to forget more things than
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannibuz has helped me become a productive
member of society in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a bit of backstory, before my injury,
I was a computer engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding something I can do now is a
wondrous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that you have found
Cannibuz and that you have found that
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating Cannibuz gives you a sense of
purpose because I'm sure that after a
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury, being a computer programmer
has got to be frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree that once you've got a brain
injury, some thought processes and some
[SPEAKER_00]: memories are kind of hindered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find myself struggling to find certain
words sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will know that this bottle in
front of me is called water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say, hand me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you pass me that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just start pointing at it and
making faces that I'm thirsty because I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't think of the fucking word water
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the word water, but just
sometimes weird shit like that will just
[SPEAKER_00]: go blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that that is from smack in
the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shit out of my head one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you have found something
that gives you a sense of purpose because
[SPEAKER_00]: not having that sense of purpose after a
brain injury can lead down a very dark
[SPEAKER_00]: path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really glad to hear that you have
found Cannibuz and that you have found
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening to keep yourself positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a question in this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question after all,
that is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many nutrient companies have a recommended
PPM or EC guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have found is that if you follow
the low recommendation dosage along with
[SPEAKER_00]: additive, like Calmag and etc,
the PPMs typically fly off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: My water is municipal and reads .2 EC out
of the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: My media is mother's earth cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get my PPM within suggested range,
I have to lower my base nutrients to below
[SPEAKER_00]: even recommended dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, I grew without checking my EC
or my pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I am attempting to dial it in and I
find it frustrating at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see other growers dosing and can't even
believe they aren't burning their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking great growers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your help always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and take a monster dab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may give out my name, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace from Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Nick, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you I will take a gigantic dab
for you right after the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about this EC
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you are buying nutrients,
they quite often come with what is known
[SPEAKER_00]: as a nutrient calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can go online and you can type in
whatever nutrient brand you have purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: and most of them will have a nutrient
calculator on their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that calculator, you usually tell it
which bottles you have purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got base newts A, base newts B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little micro product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably got Calmag and we've probably
got a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the basic things that most
nutrient companies will sell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you click on what you've purchased and
then you type in, how many weeks am I
[SPEAKER_00]: going to veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many weeks am I going to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that nutrient calculator will give
you a recommendation on how much of each
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle nutrient to feed your plants per
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are recommended on a
weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as an example, we'll type in that
we've got, like I said, we've got grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a grow A, we've got a grow B,
we've got a micro, got a Calmag,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably got a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on week one of veg, it's probably going
to say feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This many milliliters of A, this many
milliliters of B, this much Calmag,
[SPEAKER_00]: this many milliliters of your microbes,
and this many milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to use the bloom booster
in veg because we're in veg, but you get
[SPEAKER_00]: the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be how many milliliters
of that nutrient per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for my example of my made up nutrient
company today, we're going to use 50
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of grow A and 50 milliliters
of grow B and 20 mills of Calmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's just say that my nutrient
company likes 20 mills of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll mix that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the bottom of that feed chart,
quite often it will tell you what the EC
[SPEAKER_00]: or the PPMs of that mix should be
approximately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these companies will go as far as
to tell you what the ECs or the PPMs will
[SPEAKER_00]: be after you add each ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may say after I put in my 50 mills
of A and 50 mills of B, the PPMs should be
[SPEAKER_00]: at 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just making up numbers off the top
of my head today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the chart will show that once you add
the Calmag, it should bring your PPMs up
[SPEAKER_00]: to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chart will show you what your PPMs
will be for each week based on which
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of nutrients you were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a couple of things that get
my attention here in this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that gets my attention is
that you are not using reverse osmosis
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those measurements are based on
water starting at PPMs zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were starting with stuff in your
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would recommend is getting some
of that water and testing the EC and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of that water before you mix your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your email, you did say that the water
coming out of your tap reads 0.2 on the
[SPEAKER_00]: tap, which is going to be a PPM of 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're already starting off with 100
particles per million of something in your
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to find out what's actually in there,
you can go to your local water company and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get a full report of what they're
adding to your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will change seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are interested, if you're
curious about that, check that out
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that periodically,
seasonally, basically here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do change how they are treating our
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered that they do make drastic
changes because one day I was running a
[SPEAKER_00]: large facility in Colorado Springs and I
turned on our normal water supply and it
[SPEAKER_00]: reeked of chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that that was not normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I immediately filled up a container and
I did a couple of water tests to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that the PPMs were extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I paid attention and that went down
over the course of two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels like they just dosed it up
real high to get that chlorine real high
[SPEAKER_00]: for the season and they just let it right
out until the next time that they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: add more chlorine bombs or however they do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to your local water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it is 0.2 today does not mean
it is going to be 0.2 consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have basically got 100 PPMs of
something in your water before you start
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put your PPM pen in your
solution, immediately deduct 100 from the
[SPEAKER_00]: number which it is displaying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to keep in mind is
that there are actually two different PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is what is known as the 500 and the
700 PPM scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will give you different readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your nutrient company basing their
measurement on the 500 or 700 scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your PPM reader set to the 500 or the
700 scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those both need to be in sync or you will
get the wrong reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very important thing to think
about here is are your tools properly
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your EC or PPM tool calibrated to the
correct calibration?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not saying that you may have made
a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am saying that everybody needs to check
and double check that their tools are
[SPEAKER_00]: properly calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessively check your pH and EC meters
for proper calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do that on the 1st and 15th of
every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 1st of every month I also like to
change a bunch of filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we've got air conditioning filters or
maybe we've got filters that prevent too
[SPEAKER_00]: much sediment or gook from getting into
the feed lines from a reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of filter like that, I like to
clean those on the 1st and or 15th of each
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should also check your RO machine
filters if you're running reverse osmosis
[SPEAKER_00]: or any type of water filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check those filters on the 1st of each
month also and write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be writing down when you
replace filters, when you replace bulbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: write all of that stuff down.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outside of a flower room of any
facility I am in charge of, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: usually a piece of duct tape on the top
right corner of the door that'll tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: when those bulbs were last changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will say brand new bulbs, the full
room, December 1st, 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that we put all new bulbs in
that room, December 1st, 85.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to change those bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in there way too fucking
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your pin is properly calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we have determined that we are
using the appropriate PPM tool,
[SPEAKER_00]: our PPM scale to where our nutrient
company and our PPM pins are on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have determined that our PPM meter
is calibrated, the next thing to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: start figuring out how to get those PPMs
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times nutrient companies
recommend way too much product for our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purpose behind that is because
that makes us buy more product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can tell a consumer to use 100
milliliters and they have a slight risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: burning their plants with 100 milliliters,
that company is going to try to get you to
[SPEAKER_00]: use 100, maybe 120 milliliters so that you
have to buy that product as frequently as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in all reality, your plants will
probably perform best at 50 to 75
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most nutrient companies are not in
business to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most nutrient companies are in business to
sell nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they can get you to use 15,
20, maybe 25% more product than you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually need so that you come back and
spend that money sooner, they will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely say the shit that they need to
say to get you to spend the money if it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to destroy your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the companies are going to recommend a
high dosage in their nutrient calculators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix your solution as suggested by
the vendor and you realize that your EC or
[SPEAKER_00]: your PPMs are higher than desired for you,
then you're going to have a higher dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest thing to do is to dilute that
with clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw your hose right in there,
put that bucket under the spigot and turn
[SPEAKER_00]: on the water while you've got your EC pin,
your PPM meter in that bucket and wait for
[SPEAKER_00]: that clean water to fill it up until
you've reached the appropriate PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dilute it until it is the desired PPM
level or EC level which you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable feeding to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in your message, you expressed that
you have seen growers feed high PPMs and
[SPEAKER_00]: high ECs and you were amazed that they are
not burning their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we feed the plants appropriately at the
appropriate times without overlapping any
[SPEAKER_00]: specific nutrients, we can push the feeds
quite hard if we understand what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working with one nutrient
company and using every bottle that they
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend from the lineup on their
nutrient feed and you're PPMs get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit high, you do have the opportunity for
burning your plants but I feel you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: run as much of a risk as if you had mixed
nutrients from other companies and made
[SPEAKER_00]: your own hodgepodge franken nutrient
recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is because whatever
nutrient company, we're just going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff's Nutrient Company,
which I don't ever want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't ask for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff's Nutrient Company puts out a
product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what is in bottle A, bottle B and
all of the subsequent bottles so that when
[SPEAKER_00]: I make my mix recommendations,
I know you're not going to overlap too
[SPEAKER_00]: much nitrogen by adding the base nuts and
then adding this other product that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think will help in week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the developer of that product,
I already know how much nitrogen your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are receiving so I know not to give
you too much of that later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know what's in everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a good chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've paid attention to my ingredients and
I know that you're not going to get over
[SPEAKER_00]: salted or over sweetened by adding the
things that I recommend later in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know what the other companies
are going to add to their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very likely that their bloom
booster may have something overlapping my
[SPEAKER_00]: base nutrient that you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe my CalMac product also comes with
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're buying an enzymatic product
and you're double feeding the enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't going to cause a problem,
but it is a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you are not overlapping with
any specific nutrient with any specific
[SPEAKER_00]: element, you can really push the EC or the
PP EMS of the plants very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I would suggest is
finding out if your nutrient company is
[SPEAKER_00]: using the 500 or 700 PPM scale,
then make sure that your PPM pen is
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated to that same scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would test the water coming out of
the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would mix up my nutrient solution
as normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would re-measure the EC,
the PPMs, the pH and the temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would feed my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed the plants until they had
plenty of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would gather some of that runoff and I
would measure the EC, the PPMs and the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: of the runoff, which comes out of those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have a Google document for
every grow, which I am responsible for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that Google document, it shows the
date of the watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows everything that was put into that
nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it also shows the EC, the pH,
the PPMs and the temperature of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it was fed to the plants,
I also document how many gallons were fed
[SPEAKER_00]: to the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after the plants are fed,
I gather enough water for runoff from each
[SPEAKER_00]: table and I carefully measure and document
the pH, the EC and the PPMs of the runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: from each table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay close attention to how the plants
respond to that feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants show me that they got too
much nutrient, that is when I know I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to start dialing back my feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that I do that, I mix up my
nutrients just like I did last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just dilute a little bit more
with just clean water and bring my PPMs
[SPEAKER_00]: down just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way my ratios of nutrients stay the
same as the recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still getting the ratio of nitrogen to
phosphorus to potassium to CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ratios are the same, but my dilutions
and my dosages have gone down to where now
[SPEAKER_00]: my overall PPMs have lowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as those plants aren't showing
you that they are upset, you can feed them
[SPEAKER_00]: quite high PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as long as you are not overlapping
any specific nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, to recap this, just so I feel
like I gave a solid answer, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend starting with reverse osmosis
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't use reverse osmosis water,
measure the PPMs or the EC before you mix
[SPEAKER_00]: your solution and document that and deduct
that number from the total once you mix
[SPEAKER_00]: your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure that my equipment is
properly calibrated and that you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper PPM scale or using the 700 or
the 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what is your nutrient company
using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that they match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you're confident that you are
using the correct PPM scale and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got your PPMs and EC dialed in the
way that you are comfortable with,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed your plants and take a lot of notes
like I recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the most important thing is to pay
attention to how the plants respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they're getting burned,
reduce your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they can use more,
push them a little bit harder next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to push them until I see the tips
of the leaves just getting a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call that getting their fingernails
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you know that they're right
there reaching that I'm going to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: point and you know you're getting the most
out of them that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pushing them to their full
potential and you're just barely making
[SPEAKER_00]: them break a sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your statements in your message
says that for years now, I've never even
[SPEAKER_00]: checked the pH or the EC and now I find it
frustrating trying to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you are having good success
before you started stressing too much over
[SPEAKER_00]: the PPMs and the EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your pH is correct and as long
as your plants aren't showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, don't stress too much over the
numbers on the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the ladies in the grow
room and they will tell you everything you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to know.
