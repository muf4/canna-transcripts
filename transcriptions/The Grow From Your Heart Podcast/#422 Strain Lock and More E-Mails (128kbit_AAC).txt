[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 422 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to add fresh new genetics to
your garden, and I highly recommend Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Elite Seeds, and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Fortesimo
live batter from Green Dot Live Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this is a combination of
Crescendo and HSB.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HSB I think is Han Solo Burger,
another strain that I tried from Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs recently that I really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor description here says 98 octane
and dumpster, and that is ridiculously
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take the dab of this,
it tastes like fuel and gas hitting your
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you blow it out, it smells and tastes
like hot dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a couple of seconds later,
there is a garlicky fuel sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to describe the flavor and
aroma to somebody else, and I said it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like smoking a joint of gassy weed right
next to the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, it is disgustingly
delicious, and I really like the buzz from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Fortesimo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I buy a concentrate that
makes my head spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got me a little bit chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back, the label says it does
contain 67.77% THC, and it's 0% CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Fortesimo live batter,
this stuff tastes delicious, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: baked, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I am going to read a couple of
listener emails on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to some of our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to my friend Tim
R.
[SPEAKER_00]: A giant shout out to Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shout out to all of our
friends at Hogan's Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout
out to Todd K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to Ryan
S.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, a big Grow From Your Heart
Viking handshake to my friend Grimbold the
[SPEAKER_00]: Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a big Patreon shout out to
my friend Matthew K.
[SPEAKER_00]: W.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if you would like to learn how
to become a patron, all you need to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Patreon.com slash Grow From Your

[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thank you to everybody who has
supported the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I did say that I
had a couple of listener emails to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in this episode goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rasta Jeff, thank you for putting out
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found you several months ago and I
really enjoy your energy and the positive
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for noticing the positive
vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, now my wife and I
listen to you all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We especially love your gift for
describing cannabis smells and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm glad you're listening to the show
with your wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good relationship building
experience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the dude is listening to
the Grow podcast and his girlfriend is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the background going, oh, this guy again,
because she's tired of hearing my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that the wife is into the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you guys appreciate my
descriptions of cannabis smells and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has taken a while to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that people are enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message ends with, thank you for
sharing your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening and thank you for
the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, thanks again,
T and K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their names set
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So T and K, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the words of kindness and I love
knowing who's out there listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has an email,
my email address is growfromyourheart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message here and this one
goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a good 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: My 420 was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have asked for anything better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says mine has been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we both had a great 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, first, I took the
largest dab ever for me recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at least a 10th of a gram,
which is big for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it made me think of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is probably thinking of me when
he takes big dabs because on the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: grows podcast, I took kind of a semi large
dab in my Instagram videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am known for taking large dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, I have done quite large
dab videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those may be discoverable and
searchable on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, but I am known for doing
gigantic dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've slowed that down a little bit as I'm
getting older, as the concentrates are
[SPEAKER_00]: better quality, also more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessary to do a gram or a half
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I still bust out a quarter gram
or half gram dab on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people think my normal dabs are
quite ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why the large dab made our
friend think of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, as soon as I blew out the smoke,
I got a text and it sounded like a kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at my buddy and said,
I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dude takes too big of a dab for
himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He blows out the smoke and then he hears
ding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I'm done, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like some sort of a cartoon,
just like a Bill and Ted episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You nailed it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you and your buddy laughed your
asses off at that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also hope you choked and coughed for
like a good four minutes off of that dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and got super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this email that says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that is a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took a dab that made you think of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timer went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you had that experience for
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you had as good of a 420 as I
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you found almost an ounce of good
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How stoned were you when you hid that from
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably didn't even hide it from
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably got super stoned and like,
I'm going to put this out to weed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he stashed it somewhere thinking it
was there for safekeeping, but you were
[SPEAKER_00]: too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hid it from yourself on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, congrats on finding that right on
time for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too familiar with the strange
dream machine, but I hope, I hope after
[SPEAKER_00]: being hidden away in that jar for so long,
I hope that is beautifully cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he ends up with saying, I hope your 420
is just as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, my 420 was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have done anything different to
make it any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wraps up with job bless and happy
belated birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the birthday wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My birthday was March 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like this email came right on
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're late, dude, but I still
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much thanks, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I hope you're smoking some of that
dream machine right now while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more email for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, first off, thanks for listening to
the show while you're traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really cool to know that we are on
the road, in the car, keeping you
[SPEAKER_00]: entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tolerance came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I have limited grow space,
but I smoke a fair amount of flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually try to grow the largest plant
I can to get the most out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to maximize your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to maximize your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, it seems like the effects of that
strain are reduced the longer I use that
[SPEAKER_00]: one particular strain to the point that I
have to smoke a lot to get any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: euphoria from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I understand why that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that, but let's finish
the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if I switch to another strain,
that euphoria comes on strong and fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that will fade with prolonged use of
that strain until I switch to another and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you yourself experienced this or
heard of other people experience this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like this would almost show some
sort of tolerance to the terpenes or other
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical combinations, aside from just an
increase in THC tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoughts signed the Milkman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Milkman, this is a very common
thing, especially somebody that smokes on
[SPEAKER_00]: my level, somebody that consumes the
amount of product that I consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to label this as something back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it strain lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were locked out from that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the exact scientific
description or the medical explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, kind of what you said,
those terps are in your body and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: used to it and your body says,
I've got those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to get high from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about people who are on any type of
prescription pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a pain pill, if it's something for
their stomach, if it's something for their
[SPEAKER_00]: mental health, the first few times,
I don't know how long because I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen a specific medicine, but for a
duration of taking that medicine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, you get weird effects from it
because your body isn't used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting the desired effect and
you're getting what they call side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are also effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfair to label anything as a side
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting it as an effect,
that is also part of the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that's a fair label,
but we're going to move forward and quit
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, if I gave you a prescription of
something, I don't even know what I should
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I'm going to give you morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terribly something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I just put you in this scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first few times you hit that morphine
pump, you're going to be so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to feel like the craziest
morphine trip ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a few days, that morphine drip,
all it does is ease the pain because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've gotten sort of immune to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body knows what to do with this new
foreign substance that you're introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: into your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hit the little morphine button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a little dose of morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time your body goes,
oh, what is this new shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And your brain goes, never had this
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go on a really cool morphine ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to think about that,
but I'm sure it's amazing because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen my buddy in the hospital having an
issue with the morphine pump and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: his best fucking friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't abusing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in a bad condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a while, he'd hit that morphine
button and nothing would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, yeah, all it does now is take
away the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first few days, he'd hit that
morphine button and it'd be like watching
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody just slump over and get goofy and
drool on themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is when you start anything new
into your body, you will get much more
[SPEAKER_00]: increased reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you build up a tolerance to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC, in my opinion, is what sends you
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this as maybe, let's say that,
let's describe smoking as fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a long shot to start with,
but think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smoking and we're a firework.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC decides how high up into the air
you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke a lot of THC, you fly higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke a little bit of THC,
you only go so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the terpenes, the
flavonoids, the palates, the esters,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the other compounds inside of that
smoke are going to decide what direction
[SPEAKER_00]: your firework flies and also what color
that firework puts off and also how high
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets up into the air before it
explodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a weird description,
but that's always the way I've thought of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke THC, you're going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put some terps in there to
decide what direction you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get paranoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get the munchies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get the giggles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get euphoria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get relaxed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like you got to poop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your pain go away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your toe tingle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get cotton mouth?
[SPEAKER_00]: All those are going to be different things
determined by the esters, the palates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the cotton mouth is probably because
you're smoking, but all those different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, all the different highs that your
mind tricks you with are going to be from
[SPEAKER_00]: the palates, the esters, and mostly the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were smoking the same strain
for like however many days, a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, 60 days until you harvest the
next crop, you're probably giving yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: what is called strain lock, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you can probably keep your pain or
whatever medical condition you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep it at ease by continuing with
this strain, but you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the euphoria which you described until you
switch up and change those terps,
[SPEAKER_00]: change those palates, change those esters,
or change something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I may suggest, and I don't
know your grow situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you try to grow the biggest
plant you can, maybe try to grow two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are half the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you've got two different strains
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you could smoke on this one for
30 days, and then when it gets old,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke on this one or smoke this one for a
week, then this one for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you feel comfortable, however you
desire to medicate yourself, maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: would go with two smaller plants or
perhaps four smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smaller plants also means less veg
time, so that may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your grow situation, so maybe that's
not even an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're growing your own medicine,
maybe you need to find a friend who you
[SPEAKER_00]: can help in his garden or her garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys can become friends and share
grow information and grow knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of get your grows on the same
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you harvest, maybe you could
trade an ounce for an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, it's not uncommon to
say, hey, I just grew way too much of this
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever strain I've been smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking it just like you for way
too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trade you an ounce for an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your friend will go, let me see the
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, dude, take an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so much weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got so much herb land around in
Colorado that you can probably just take
[SPEAKER_00]: an ounce if you wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a quarter or something,
we'll just pass it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, you are very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are experiencing something that I have
called strain lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes on very quickly for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go shopping at the dispensary,
I quite often frustrate myself because,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see, the last time I went,
they had, I'm just, I'm not trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to grab, I've got most of
my last shopping experience right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one gram of Mambo batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one gram of Lucky Charms Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one gram of Magic Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gram of Tropicana cookies and one gram
of Lucy Jet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some Fortesimo, some Mai Tai,
some Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you notice I bought a large variety
and almost all of those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got one gram of the Tropicana
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a four gram jar of it because it
smells and tastes amazing and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't pass it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I shop, I buy this variety
because I quickly experience the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: lock which you were talking about even on
the level that I consume these
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still, I'll smoke this whole gram of
Tropicana cookies today and I'll try to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke some of that tomorrow and be like,
huh, I didn't get a buzz off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a dab of the Lucy Jet and it'll
blow my mind just because I switched it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happens quite quickly to me and it
still happens with concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I shop for concentrates,
I generally buy one gram of several
[SPEAKER_00]: different things so that I can enjoy it
and stay buzzed for several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now where that frustrates me is I bought
this Lucy Jet and I haven't tried it yet
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm just gonna save this one
until, so I've got something fresh to
[SPEAKER_00]: switch into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that when I open up this package,
it's going to smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a couple of dabs of it and I'll
say, shit, why didn't I buy like four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way the dispensaries work is when
you go back, all that good shit is gone
[SPEAKER_00]: because the smart people bought two or
three or three or four at a time when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, that's how life goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm staying medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to recap on this email, what you are
experiencing is what I call strain lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to switch up to another
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't think that you can fix this just
by upgrading to concentrates all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: because what that will do, you'll put
yourself in the same position with
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke so much concentrate that sometimes
I will spend most of the day not
[SPEAKER_00]: medicating, not even thinking about
medicating because I know it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do anything to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to wait until the evening time
until right before podcast time so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually take one of those quarter
gram, half gram dabs that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about and have it actually fuck me up and
have some sort of a tremendous mark on my
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, it's just smoking through
concentrates and I never even notice any
[SPEAKER_00]: effect from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think you were experiencing is
what I call strain lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to have to switch it up
or you're going to have to consume less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who wants to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So switch it up seems to be the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Milkman, I hope I answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a great time with the
grandparents and I hope the road trip went
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
