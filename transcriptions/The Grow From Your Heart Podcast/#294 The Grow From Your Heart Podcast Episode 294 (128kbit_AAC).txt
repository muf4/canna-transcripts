[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for a Thursday episode of the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to call these Thursday episodes the
Thursday quickie.
[SPEAKER_01]: These quickies are brought to you by our
friends at the hella dank seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check them out at dank seed
dot store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a
quickie unless we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get on with the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am back with another Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to start these shows by letting you
know what I am smoking on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am dabbing on some of this lemon OG live
resin from our friends at the garden of
[SPEAKER_01]: Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I scooped a little bit out of the large
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fairly large reserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I scooped some out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it into a smaller container and then
I opened up some of these lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_01]: high terpene full spectrum extracts from
our friends at apothecary and I dumped the
[SPEAKER_01]: high terpene extract into the live resin
and I gave it a little stir and I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: taking dabs of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high goes straight to my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works in sky rockets for your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a quick update on my most recent
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been paying attention,
you know that I've been working on a
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry cookies reversal project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a blueberry cookies plant that
smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have reversed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the female and turned it into a
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produced pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put that pollen on several elite
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it on the Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it on a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the pollen on more blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it on platinum tangy, strawberry
fields and lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to breed a bunch of candy
flavored sweet and sour terp sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping I've created a big bag of
candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are just about done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, they are at day 60 right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the seeds in the very tops of the
plants are just about finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds at the lowers are taking a
little longer to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they're almost done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start chopping those down here in
just a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some new creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will need some new names soon once
things are tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an update on the breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let them go 63 to 65 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually just about perfect for the
strains I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll be cut down depending on my
schedule and how my life goes in three to
[SPEAKER_01]: five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll have some new stuff to play
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an update on the blueberry
cookies breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blueberry cookies bud in there,
it's in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under a small white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that bud is as big as my forearm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am amazed at the size of cola that plant
put out, especially for being seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward and keep this Thursday
quickie going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a message from somebody on Facebook
and they said, when you guys go eight to
[SPEAKER_01]: nine weeks of flowering, are you
considering that from the 12-12 switch or
[SPEAKER_01]: from when it actually starts
pre-flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to get a better timeframe on
finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this person is asking, when we say that
a plant will take nine weeks to flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: are we counting that nine weeks from when
we see the first signs of bud set or from
[SPEAKER_01]: the day we switch the light cycle from
whatever our veg time is over to our 12-12
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time?
[SPEAKER_01]: That nine week flowering period or
whatever your package of seed indicates,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is from the day you flip your timer
to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were on a 24 hour or an 18-6 or a
19-5, whatever your veg cycle was,
[SPEAKER_01]: the day you flip your timer to 12 on,
12 off, that has now become day one of
[SPEAKER_01]: week one of your flowering period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to go 63 days,
that starts now, not from when you see bud
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_01]: That starts from the time you flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mark your calendar eight to nine weeks
from there and start paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is day one of flower, week one of
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start adjusting your nutrients to that
schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start planting your flowering,
your flushing, your harvest, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: will go around that date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, something I've got to mention as a
responsible grower, breeder, and educator,
[SPEAKER_01]: do not let those numbers printed on the
package dictate too heavily when you cut
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a good guideline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good idea, but each plant is going
to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get 10 seeds out of a package and
five of them are males and you cut them
[SPEAKER_01]: down and you've got five females left,
you may have one phenotype that ends or
[SPEAKER_01]: finishes at the end of week eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be day 56 and that one is ready to
cut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have another one that needs to go
all the way to day 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have another that needs to go to
day 63.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be one that fucks around and
wants to go to day 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to need to pay attention
to each individual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start flushing 10 to 14 days in advance of
your anticipated harvest time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't hold too hard to that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay more attention to the trichomes on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a scope, a magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a 420 scope or a dope scope
or a jeweler's loop or something from the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow store or something on Amazon that
will magnify your trichomes at least 60 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a 60X or a 100X magnifier at
minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get yourself something with a light in
it and LEDs so that you can see what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at and a nice jeweler's
loop or a dope scope or a magnifying glass
[SPEAKER_01]: or something you can get in there and look
at the trichomes and see the trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: color and the trichome development.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want them to start becoming amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a scope that hooks up to my
computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Dynolite scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it cost around a hundred bucks and
I got it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It plugs right into my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of a bitch to get it
installed.
[SPEAKER_01]: To install to my MacBook, it took me a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I got it figured out, it works like a
charm every time I plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the Dynolite scope, plug that into
your MacBook, carry the computer into the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room or carry a plant near your
computer and press that magnifier or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Press the magnifying glass, the magnifier,
the dope scope, your 420 scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Dynolite scope, press it up against
the plant and see what your trichomes look
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check in several places.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top is gonna be a little more done
than the bottom in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for 20 to 30% amber
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trichomes are those, the crystals,
those mushrooms growing off the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: those skinny stalks with round bulbous
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna start off clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna get kind of silvery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're gonna get milky white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're gonna start degrading and
turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna look like you sprinkled Dr.
Pepper on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want about 30% of them to look like
they've got Dr. Pepper on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look in the screen, you're
probably gonna see, depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: zoomed in you've got your stuff and how
many trichomes are on your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna see between 10 and 30
trichomes in that little view on your
[SPEAKER_01]: viewfinder on your magnifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got 10, you want three of
them to start turning amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 to 30% amber trichomes is what you're
looking for when you harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number on the seed pack is a good
idea, but they don't know exactly which
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know the temperatures in your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what kind of grow light
you're growing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many variables that contribute
to the finishing time of a plant that it
[SPEAKER_01]: is, the numbers on the package are simply
a suggestion and a guideline, and
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, quite often, a sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not tell you that this plant's gonna
be done in eight weeks, when it could
[SPEAKER_01]: really take 10 weeks, but who knows,
because I've already got your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a lot of breeders will do
that stuff, and back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: that used to be a very easy way to
increase sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do it so much anymore,
and it's not something I would do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can't be done so much anymore,
because we're much more accountable now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're reachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social media makes the breeders very
accountable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that's not something I would have
done, but it is something that has been
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would just print, hey, this flower
finishes in eight weeks, and you grow it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it ends up taking 70 days,
and you're sitting there going,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck, or a lot of people just cut
it down, and then they thought,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, this plant sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't very good, and it was because
they didn't let it go to its full
[SPEAKER_01]: potential, so don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cut plants down early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, the seeds that you have are
from a breeder who had some morals and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually wrote down a realistic timeframe
on their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to give a two-week timeframe on my
packaging or on my strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask me how long will this take,
I will say eight to nine weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: or nine to 10 weeks, and I try to keep it
realistic, and I've grown enough of my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to know how long they're actually
going to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of the other breeders aren't
growing enough of theirs, and maybe they
[SPEAKER_01]: think it only takes eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but don't hold too fast to
what that says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to each phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beauty from growing from seeds is that
you can find something unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want something to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got cycles that take eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got cycles that take eight or
nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can find a plant that fits
perfectly into your system so you could
[SPEAKER_01]: dial it in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the beauty of growing from
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to find the one that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to find the one that grows,
smells, tastes, and smokes the way you
[SPEAKER_01]: like, but also you get to find the one
that works the best in the grow room for
[SPEAKER_01]: you as the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That timeframe goes from the time you flip
your lights to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is day one of ... That's when you
should switch to your bloom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That day is what you should base your
anticipated flush time off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That date is what you should base your
anticipated harvest time off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That day is what you should adjust your
nutrient calendars off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day one is when you change your timer to
12 on and 12 off.
