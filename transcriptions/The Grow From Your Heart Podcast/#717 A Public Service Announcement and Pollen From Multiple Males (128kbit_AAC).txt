I feel like I've talked for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: about that this podcast has been long
already we haven't covered a damn thing
[SPEAKER_00]: let me jump into the next topic that I do
have written down I do have a PSA this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a public service announcement this is a
message from rasta jeff one of those the
[SPEAKER_00]: more you know except mine would say the
more you grow right that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking here shout out to whatever I took
dabs of also it's got me in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking zone shout out to ever put a smile
on my face for Valentine's Day you know
[SPEAKER_00]: who you is who you are my PSA goes like
this you guys a lot of times I get
[SPEAKER_00]: messages and emails from people who have a
really cool company name which is cool if
[SPEAKER_00]: your company name is like uncle Jim's
fucking big weed farm that's cool stoner
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob's I almost said stoner Dave I got a
friend named stoner Dave I'm not singling
[SPEAKER_00]: you out you don't use stoner Dave is your
business name that's your name but a
[SPEAKER_00]: stoner Dave's pot farm is a really cool
name I know what you do I know who you are
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we do business I might have to mail
you a package to stoner Dave's pot farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't like that shit at all you guys
when you're naming your company let's
[SPEAKER_00]: think about stuff like that you're going
to have to have packages mailed to you I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like putting stoner Dave's pot farm
in my shipping app when I mail things to
[SPEAKER_00]: people if it's a t-shirt or a pack of
seeds I don't like it the kid at the post
[SPEAKER_00]: office the old lady at the post office the
old man the transgendered person working
[SPEAKER_00]: at the post office that is ageless or
sexless got to be careful nowadays that
[SPEAKER_00]: person may see that package that says
stoner Dave's pot farm like well I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the fuck is in there and they
may they have the ability the option the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to be a shady fuck and open it
up they may have just stolen your t-shirt
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds or both and I don't want that
to happen so just a public service
[SPEAKER_00]: announcement from a guy who's been doing
business for a long time who's got maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more steps ahead of you in business
maybe just some ideas maybe it's just my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion let's be more careful about naming
our companies you can name your company
[SPEAKER_00]: stoner Dave's pot farm but you can also
have an LLC or a doing business as name
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can mail shit to and talk about
more openly in my business affairs that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not obvious that we're just doing
weed business I know that stoner Dave's
[SPEAKER_00]: pot farm is a cool name but it doesn't
look good on shipping it doesn't look good
[SPEAKER_00]: on invoices and it definitely here's the
other thing I want to talk about if you
[SPEAKER_00]: start a business you've got to pay taxes
do you really want to send something to
[SPEAKER_00]: the IRS the government the state and the
city with stoner Dave's pot farm written
[SPEAKER_00]: on it unless it's a cultivation or a
dispensary those are the only things I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: really do that too and still I don't name
those obvious fucking pothead things I try
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay a little bit businessy
professional but naming your company is
[SPEAKER_00]: very important I have to put the name of
your company on an invoice I have to put
[SPEAKER_00]: it on a package it goes on a tax report so
that stuff I'm dealing with right now
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm mailing a package to somebody
who I'm like really bro is that really the
[SPEAKER_00]: name you want me to put on that package
I'm not gonna do that you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: initials is what you're gonna get on your
package so just the idea you're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: dry snitching on yourself if you put
fucking dank weed LLC and you live in an
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment building that may ring some
bells that may let me get your apartment
[SPEAKER_00]: building checked out you know I'm saying
so just be smarter with the names you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dry snitching on yourself be careful be
serious also I'm mailing the shit to your
[SPEAKER_00]: house it's coming to your front door it
has passed a bunch of hands that have all
[SPEAKER_00]: read stoner Dave's pot farm at this
address and I know exactly where that is
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting your address your name and
then possibly taxes on it I've rambled on
[SPEAKER_00]: enough about that I think you get the
point you guys it's cool to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: business but let's kind of and it's cool
to get shit shipped to you but let's
[SPEAKER_00]: separate our Instagram fame from our
business name my company is I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics I make I read genetic seeds I do
not use that as my that's a two that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: doing business as name that's not what
we're listed as there's no one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: business names are there are umbrellas to
keep that stuff a little bit more careful
[SPEAKER_00]: be careful you guys it is a fun revolution
a fun evolution that we're coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: black market the dark ages to the free
market the green age the revolution the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of cannabis is great but don't
get ahead of yourself don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: overzealous don't create a name that's
gonna get you noticed in the wrong way by
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong people and if you are doing
business if you're creating an LLC or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever be careful with those taxes get
your tax person your lawyer your account
[SPEAKER_00]: people get all those people in line so you
can do shit correctly especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna name your shit stoner Dave's pot
farm if stoner Dave's pot farm doesn't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: their taxes I cannot wait to come check
you out that's that's just fucking begging
[SPEAKER_00]: for stuff so be careful you guys that is
my public stoner announcement check
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself when you're naming your stuff
Instagram it is cool be fucking stoner
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave's ganja farm that grows the best weed
and smokes nine pounds a day that's a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking name on Instagram I don't want to
put that in my shipping app I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make an invoice with that don't want to
turn that into the tax people don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: want to fuck with that so be a little bit
uh let's step out of that and I'm I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics you guys are paying I read you're
not paying I read genetics it's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up on anything when you pay so let's
just be more careful that's all I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting at now let's move forward I do
have another not quite a public service
[SPEAKER_00]: announcement this isn't this is an
invitation slash advertising last year I
[SPEAKER_00]: did talk about the groovy gravy secret

it was 45 minutes in it's only gonna be a
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minute show I love you trolls on the
internet you guys are beautiful let's jump
[SPEAKER_00]: into some of the emails here because I do
have quite a few in front of me this one's
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled 717 that's this episode what do
you know this episode goes a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: like this I found this one on YouTube I
don't usually take comments from YouTube I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't read them on the show a lot it's
easier to email me this one was good it
[SPEAKER_00]: was worth it it says what did you do with
the spider I really want to know a big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to my buddy slim ass that's a
good question that shows me you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: watching listening for quite a while if
you've been paying attention a few
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes back I discovered a spider in my
grow room it was a little fuzzy spider in
[SPEAKER_00]: California we call them Mexican jumping
spiders I don't know the the Greek name I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know the species fucking I don't
know the genotype I don't know phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: what we got in there I don't know the
cross I don't know it's mom and dad
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype and parents I don't know the f1s
of this spider I know it was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy ugly fucking spider and he looked
like he wasn't causing any problems he
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't making any webs and in my opinion
he was working security he was eating
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats whiteflies whatever may have
chosen to pop into that grow room he was
[SPEAKER_00]: working security and taking those bitches
out cuz I didn't see any bugs in there for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while this question said what did you do
with the spider bro I didn't do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: with the spider you just quit popping up
he quit coming around he's gone he either
[SPEAKER_00]: migrated or died or eyes fucking somewhere
else he traveled somewhere else into that
[SPEAKER_00]: area and he's just hiding out hanging out
now got bored maybe he got tired of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights maybe he got stoned maybe he's
done I don't know he's probably dead by
[SPEAKER_00]: now I don't know how long a little Mexican
jumping spider lives but I just
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared I didn't kill him I didn't do
anything to get rid of him I didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to keep him around either it was
business as usual I kept an eye on him he
[SPEAKER_00]: kept an eye on me or she I just gender
assigned to that spider and I have no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: but eventually it disappeared and that's
the end of the story bro I don't know it
[SPEAKER_00]: just disappears like a dog it wandered off
and that was it so thanks for asking I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: let the spider know you asked about it if
I see it again I'll shake its hand for you
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell him you said what's up big shout
out to our friend I'll shake all eight of
[SPEAKER_00]: his fucking hands could you imagine
shaking hands with spider doing the the
[SPEAKER_00]: homie high fives what's up bro she bang
bang bang bang bang I'm fucking high I
[SPEAKER_00]: told you all right shot it's my buddy slim

been a staple in my life since college for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20 years if you've listened to the
episode or the 7-eleven episode that was
[SPEAKER_00]: about munchies I talked about putting a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a pan
[SPEAKER_00]: and frying that bitch up just like you
would a grilled cheese sandwich the peanut
[SPEAKER_00]: butter gets all melty the jelly gets all
melty in there it makes us gooey
[SPEAKER_00]: delightful texture get that bread just a
little bit crispy oh my goodness that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: stoner snack that you cannot believe this
dude said I have not once burnt the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of my mouth because I can never wait
bro same I probably got scars and a
[SPEAKER_00]: reshaped mouth and a burnt palate because
of many numerous fried or grilled peanut
[SPEAKER_00]: butter and jelly sandwiches do you guys
call it fried or grilled because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing you're throwing that bitches
it's a grilled cheese we put peanut butter
[SPEAKER_00]: in that bitch but my grandma always called
her fried PB&J shout out to grandma rest
[SPEAKER_00]: in peace love you and miss you she's the
one that introduced me to the grilled or
[SPEAKER_00]: fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich and
my lady taught me a lot of things and that
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of the top of the list things that
I'm gonna remember forever bro if you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't done it yet make a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich butter that bitch on
[SPEAKER_00]: both sides throw in a pan until that
peanut butter starts gushing out the sides
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bread gets a little fucking crispy
thank me later send me an email or patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: .com forward slash grow from your heart
that's the way to do it all right I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned I'm telling you we're through two
of the emails already we're like 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes into this episode let's jump into
this one this one says hey I read that I
[SPEAKER_00]: give a shout out to midnight samurai yeah
shout out to midnight samurai this one
[SPEAKER_00]: came from our friend do they want their
name said let's see I'm gonna call you Leo
[SPEAKER_00]: what up Leo this one came from our friend
Leo says hello I read what up Leo nice to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet you brother says is it somehow
possible to grow and collect pollen from
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple male plants and strains in one
tent while keeping pollen separated or
[SPEAKER_00]: should it only be one male plant per tent
then it follows up with what is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: okay we're gonna talk about two different
questions here the next part is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best method for growing and collecting
pollen from multiple male strains all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so this is a really good question
the question here is can I put basically
[SPEAKER_00]: can I put multiple dudes in a tent and
collect the pollen from those and then
[SPEAKER_00]: know what that pollen is my answer is no
bro I would not try that I would not do
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would not recommend that there's no
way to prevent pollen from this plant just
[SPEAKER_00]: drifting over to this plant this pollen
drifting over to this one you have no way
[SPEAKER_00]: of knowing which pollen is which even if
you do go tap that plant get pollen out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it the first one you touch that pollen is
going all over all of the plants now
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone you touch is the first one plus
the second one and then when you touch the
[SPEAKER_00]: second one now you're just compounding you
see what I'm saying you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: number one you might be cool number two
you're gonna have number one and number
[SPEAKER_00]: two number three is gonna be one two and
three and four is gonna be a clusterfuck
[SPEAKER_00]: of every male plant in there so I replied
to our friend Leo and I said I would stick
[SPEAKER_00]: with one male plant in the room or you're
going to have a maury povich situation
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody gonna know who the baby daddy is if
that's okay with you that's fine but I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to know pedigree and history of the
plants there's a reason a rhyme and a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why I'm making the cross I want
that selected male to do a certain thing
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're just trying to do an open
pollination of multiple plants to make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for fun you can do multiple males it
is not uncommon to take let's say we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to make an arise open pollination
just to make a bunch more arise seeds show
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and see what is in that seed
line I would take a pack of males or a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of arise seeds a number 10 20 30
seeds whatever you got room for time for
[SPEAKER_00]: space grow them you're gonna find a number
of males and a number of females I would
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of maybe pull out a couple things
that are not not exactly what I want pull
[SPEAKER_00]: them out take them out of there but then
leave a few males and a few meet females
[SPEAKER_00]: in there they're all arise and just do an
open pollination now you've got we'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: say arise f3 open pollination with three
or four males and five females and then
[SPEAKER_00]: when I sell them or talk about them I
would list descriptions of each male and
[SPEAKER_00]: female and then we would just see what
comes out of there that's a beautiful open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination because that shows diversity
amongst all of those different ah is it
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes and phenotypes in that one
because we're gonna see genotypes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: two different genes crossing and
phenotypes from different expressions
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna see a lot of different shit by
crossing that open pollination different
[SPEAKER_00]: males to different females but the problem
with that in my opinion you don't know who
[SPEAKER_00]: the baby daddy is so if you want to make
more of those you don't know which male to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab and which female to grab to make that
happen but at the same time as a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: as a somebody who wants to see a lot of
expression a lot of things a lot of traits
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a lot of data is what I'm trying to
say I love that open pollination because
[SPEAKER_00]: it lets me know what is in there somewhere
I may not know exactly where it is but I
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's in that pack I know somewhere I
can find that fucking plant I can breed
[SPEAKER_00]: that again and create it shows me
potential so unless you're doing an open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination to forward one line I wouldn't
do this if you've got like a male of a
[SPEAKER_00]: rise and a male of Jack the Ripper and a
male of candy store I wouldn't do that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have one dude in there I would get
his pollen and I would work with him
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise the best way to say it bro
you're gonna have a baby daddy situation
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no way to keep that pollen
separated I would not do that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to collect pollen for multiple
males I would stagger them I would flower
[SPEAKER_00]: one out it only takes a few days to get
pollen maybe 21 days to get plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen out of that dude I get pollen cut
him down clean it up start over get
[SPEAKER_00]: another dude you can have the other guy
vegging just have him on standby all you
[SPEAKER_00]: do is throw him into flower as soon as
you're done cleaning up or like two days
[SPEAKER_00]: before he cut down cuz you're gonna get
time there's time ahead before the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: starts coming as long as you can clean up
the old pollen before the new pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: starts coming you can perpetually make
pollen for yourself now don't contaminate
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen don't cross that pollen
there's more to the question that I do
[SPEAKER_00]: want to cover what's the best method for
growing and collecting pollen from
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple I wouldn't do that so that
answers the second part there like you to
[SPEAKER_00]: save after separating yeah I just would
not do that definitely wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple dudes in there I'm reading this
quietly to myself to make sure I covered
[SPEAKER_00]: it multiple strains and having a few
different males you'd like to save after
[SPEAKER_00]: separate yeah I just wouldn't do that dude
it's not gonna work the way that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to it's gonna be that Maury Povich
situation just like I'm talking about who
[SPEAKER_00]: is the father you're not the father maybe
you are the father if you want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if you want something to play with
that is really cool that could really work
[SPEAKER_00]: for you but if you want something to put
to market to make f2s with to really work
[SPEAKER_00]: on I would kind of I wouldn't do that
that's that's the bottom line there all
