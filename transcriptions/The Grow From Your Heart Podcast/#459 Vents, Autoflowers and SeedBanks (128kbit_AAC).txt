[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 459 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of double OG,
full spectrum extract from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a four gram jar, and it is
ridiculously terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I open this jar, it smells like
gas and pine salt and funk in the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The double OG is a blend of Legends OG and
Sour Double.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as pine,
sour, and lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be a perfect description.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this product
contains 74.73% THC, and zero CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor, the aroma,
and the buzz from the double OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious and always
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I would like to do
some shout outs to a few of our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big, giant Grow
From Your Heart podcast shout out and a
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you to David O'Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to Ryan S.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast thank you to our friends out
[SPEAKER_00]: at Hogan's Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, let's give a big shout out and
a thank you to Tanner M.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant Grow From Your

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I said that I was going to read some
[SPEAKER_00]: listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first email comes from a person who
signed their message as Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friend Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, I have a few questions
about passive vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure that they mean passive
vents when growing in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my tent barely has any negative
pressure to it unless my passive vents are
[SPEAKER_00]: closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should these vents not be fully open?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also somehow... Okay, so let's focus
on the first part of the question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're growing in a grow tent,
it is ideal to have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation sucking that old air out of
the tent and causing some sort of passive
[SPEAKER_00]: suction to bring fresh air into the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put a six inch blower right at
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that hole at the top of the
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set a six inch blower right on top of
the tent on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run ducting into the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run the ducting as appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running ducted lights or if I've
got a carbon filter, I adjust as
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to utilize an extraction fan of
some sort in a grow tent to always be
[SPEAKER_00]: removing stale stagnant air and humidity
while replacing that with fresh CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine if you zip up your grow tent
and you've got a six inch blower sucking
[SPEAKER_00]: air out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air has to come in from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those grow tents come with passive
vents on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is undo a Velcro little
Velcro flap and it rolls right up and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a passive air vent for air to
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what this person is asking about is
he's saying that he is barely getting any
[SPEAKER_00]: suction on the tent when he closes it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tent should cave in just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should look like it breathed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should look like somebody trying to
suck in their gut and get in some skinny
[SPEAKER_00]: jeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what the tent should look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are sucking all the air out of it and
that air is not being replenished quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of caves in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that negative pressure because it
is negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being sucked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive pressure would be blowing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get negative pressure so
that we can suck that old stale air right
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the top and then use those passive
vents just to bring fresh air from the
[SPEAKER_00]: room right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to employ another blower or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air will just come in naturally
through displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our list listener, our friend here is
concerned that the tent is barely getting
[SPEAKER_00]: any negative pressure unless the passive
vents are closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they ask, should they not be
fully open?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as that air is circulating from
that tent and as long as the temps and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and VPD are stabilized and
balanced appropriately in that tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can adjust those flaps as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to see extreme suction on
that tent, but that lets you know that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: That knows you were getting a rapid air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's sucking in a little bit,
that shows you, you are getting sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing is to pay
attention to the temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, the most important thing is
to pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants happy with what's going on
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are okay with it,
you don't need to change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are showing you that they
are unhappy, we can use the information
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plants and we can compare that to
the information from your monitors and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can dial it in and diagnose the problem
and make corrections from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't see any problems,
there is no need to change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to experiment with those passive
vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got them fully open and you're
not satisfied with the amount of negative
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, maybe close one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe close both of them halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe seal them up completely and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got enough air coming in
through the natural gaps in that material
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can replace that air just from
sucking it in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can play with the airflow for a few
minutes in that room and not cause too
[SPEAKER_00]: many major problems to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know if it's getting too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know if it's getting too humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be right there paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it go for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your hygrometer, your thermometer or
your PL grow minder unit in there and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: close attention to what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you are exchanging that air
sufficiently and you do not see any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with the plants, I don't think it
is necessary to freak out too much over
[SPEAKER_00]: the adjustment of the passive vent
settings on your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still work with a grow tent in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a five by five grow tent with a
thousand watt light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put that six inch vortex blower
right on top to suck the air out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That six inch blower is way more than
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how powerful of a blower or
an extraction fan you are using,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know that my six inch does way more
than enough air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a four inch blower,
it is probably sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would set up a hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would set up a thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would set up a PL grow minder unit if
that is available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would pay attention to the
temperature and the humidity and the VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: in that grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pay close attention to the
conditions right before and right after
[SPEAKER_00]: your light cycle changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 15 minutes before the lights go off,
look and see what your temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pay attention to that for the next 30
to 45 minutes and see what it does and do
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing when the lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can know where your peaks and
valleys are in your humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature swings and you can adjust
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If necessary, if it's getting too humid or
too hot, maybe allow more airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's staying too dry in there,
maybe minimize the airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants, pay attention
to your monitors, and then adjust if
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing needs to be done, if it ain't
broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is more to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm also semi close to a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I prevent light leaks into these
when I move into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible to put a black bug screen
taped over the window or something?
There are no need to open either.
I can do that.
I can turn on the power, you can turn off
the power.
You can also bring in a fan as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are passive vents that also prevent
light from getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also do both need to be opened to create
even airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both do not need to be open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that you can open one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend putting a fan or
something inside there to stir that air as
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes in so you don't just get air
going in one side, right out the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely have a fan in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stirring that, you should have a fan in
the grow tent anyway, mixing the air to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent micro climates, to stir around
that CO2, to move around that to help
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent PM problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a fan is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably such a small area that that
fan is not going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by moving in some air, I think
displacement will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get enough circulation in a small
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, you don't need to open both vents
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do them both 50-50,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that big of a space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air will move itself around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a fan in there that'll solve that
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were worried about light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the grow tents are sufficiently
made to where they do not leak light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that we want to be extra
careful and get zero light in our tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like that you were trying to be
prepared before we go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can absolutely put some of that black
shade cloth over those vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would focus more on covering the
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: The window is where the light is coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just work on blocking that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it is probably in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a window that you need to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a spot where you need some
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may make things look weird if you just
go put a black curtain over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a black curtain up to where
the people outside see a black curtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would staple some panda film
over the black curtain so that no light
[SPEAKER_00]: can get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the people on the inside see the
panda film.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on the outside see a curtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like a normal bedroom
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't cover the window,
you can absolutely put some of that shade
[SPEAKER_00]: cloth over those vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what you can do is not Velcro the
flaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just let them hang and don't Velcro
them down or up to where they're just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of hanging, when the air flows,
it'll lift the flaps up enough to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the air to move through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it will lift up enough
to allow the light to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that is way toward the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully your window and your floor
aren't near the same height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you got a good three feet
between there toward the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would have to go down, get into that vent,
work its way back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly block out all of the windows in
any room where I put a grow tent so I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually don't have to deal with this type
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first advice is to block out the window
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is not an option, my next move
would be to cover those vents with a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of shade cloth or perhaps just leave those
flaps down to where the light can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put the shade cloth over it and
leave the flaps down and then see how much
[SPEAKER_00]: passive air is allowed to get into that
tent once you activate that blower at full
[SPEAKER_00]: speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you let those vents, those flaps lay
down on their own, and then you put that
[SPEAKER_00]: cover over there, that may create the
negative pressure you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to get enough air
flowing through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be sucking out a lot of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That restriction may give you the negative
pressure you were seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you decide to troubleshoot this or
remedy this situation, I strongly suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that when your flowering cycle begins,
you spend some time in that grow tent at
[SPEAKER_00]: lights out time and see what happens in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you physically go in there,
turn off the lights in the grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: leave everything else just like it would
normally be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lights in your grow tent go out at
five o'clock and the lights in the bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: would be on and the sun is up and all of
that shit, do it just like it normally
[SPEAKER_00]: would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in that tent, turn off the grow light,
have somebody seal you in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes need a few minutes to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes may need three to five,
maybe seven to 10 minutes to adjust to the
[SPEAKER_00]: total darkness and see if there are any
light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see little pinpricks of light
anywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see your hand in front of your
face?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that happens quite often is we
run ducting into the grow over the ducted
[SPEAKER_00]: light hood and then back out and somehow
the light from outside comes through that
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got ducting going in or out of
your grow tent, make sure there is not
[SPEAKER_00]: light going up that duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, much of the ducting we are
sold is wrapped with an aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: reflective type coating on the inside and
that really reflects light all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down the damn duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get the light just bouncing all the
way down the duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that ducting going outside
or into another room, and then you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: that ducting going to your vented light
hood that is inside of the grow tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: that works just like a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It illuminates the whole damn grow tent
just like a grow light would.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't go in there and look,
you may never realize it's even happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will not flower properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be sitting there for weeks
wondering why they look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I certainly suggest that at the
beginning of your flowering phase on day
[SPEAKER_00]: one, you go in there and find out what is
happening during your dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there light leaks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to make adjustments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out on day one instead of 10
days into flower when everything looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like complete shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I think by blocking out the
light, we are going to work on your
[SPEAKER_00]: negative pressure issue and all of these
problems will solve themselves together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you go in there and make
sure that that is absolutely dark during
[SPEAKER_00]: your dark phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mark, I want to thank you for the
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any more questions or if
you've got a follow-up, please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you remember the email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got some good momentum
going, so let's just keep moving right
[SPEAKER_00]: into the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hello Rasta Jeff, I am a new big
time fan of your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started listening to you this week
and I'm like a quarter way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit dude, you've listened to a
hundred and something episodes in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're taking notes and I hope you
are learning a lot and it's great to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are a big time fan of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: After just finding us, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've been having some issues
eating and sleeping as of the past two
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself and Big Pharma don't mix at all and
lab medicine makes me feel worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a cannabis advocate for years,
seeing many people in my family use and
[SPEAKER_00]: lead very productive lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get a medical marijuana
card, but my doctor is giving me the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardest time about it and every visit just
turns into me being preached to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has got to be so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to the doctor looking for relief and
they're probably getting paid by a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical company to recommend you a
prescription and giving you cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: the last thing they want to do because
that is actually going to help you and
[SPEAKER_00]: make you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not good business for a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand how frustrating that can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I live in a prohibition state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then how are you trying to get weed
from your doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be a medical marijuana state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a prohibition state and as a new
father and husband, I refuse to put my
[SPEAKER_00]: family in danger by dealing with the
extremely shady dealers where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to mention, I don't know what they
do to their buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes buying product off the street
can be a little bit scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big debate about the black
market versus the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I am concerned with
on the black market is nobody is required
[SPEAKER_00]: to have any sort of pesticide training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what they are applying to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that the things
applied in a commercial grow are
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous, but we have to document it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very regulated and things undergo
lab testing in a black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes from the black market to your bong
without any sort of regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what's going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get us back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have done tons of research and
watched hours of video and I feel I am
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to grow my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you a huge compliment
because you did this in the right order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You watched videos and did tons of
research and now you feel like you are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, we had somebody who
grew their own and then when things went
[SPEAKER_00]: to shit, they didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to do some research and reach
out for help because they made a major
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am proud of you for doing this the
correct way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the only thing I'm not sure is
where to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know I want to try autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you knew a fast strain
I could try and a seed bank to order from
[SPEAKER_00]: because I keep reading a mixed bag of
information about them and I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have anyone to guide me in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some good guidance here,
but you may not like part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a fan of autoflowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you are a brand new grower,
you should learn how to grow photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with autoflower
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel that as a new grower,
you would learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have a more enjoyable experience
and you could probably build a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the plant if you were
able to experience an actual vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle where you could work with the plant
and do things to improve the yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can choose when to flower the
plant by changing the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just builds a different understanding
and a different relationship of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is absolutely nothing wrong with
growing autoflower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is what you want to do,
if that is what is going to make you
[SPEAKER_00]: happy, you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me slow you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let me get in your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live your dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I feel like it would be
beneficial if you grew regular seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: your first couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you understand the nuances of the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autoflowers are great in certain
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autoflowers are great for certain
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I feel like a beginner grower
would learn more and have a more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: experience by growing from a regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not because I make regular
seeds and feminize seeds and I do not make
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how I feel as an educator,
as a passionate person about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you've got the opportunity and
the potential to learn more from growing
[SPEAKER_00]: from regular seeds for your first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now having said that, you may still want
to buy autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to buy autoflower seeds,
I do recommend Mephisto Genetics as your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mephisto makes very reliable autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand why you may be drawn to
autoflowers for your first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also a few disadvantages when
growing autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your main reason for wanting to grow an
autoflower plant is speed and ease of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, I advise you to rethink your
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants the quickest, easiest grow
that they can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not the goal with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis takes patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, quality cannabis takes
effort and attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can achieve all of those things with
an autoflower plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a new grower, I would recommend and
prefer to see you learn the basics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant before we go looking for
shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good crop of regular cannabis under
your belt and get that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what a veg cycle is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to grow your clones in your next cycle
so that you can become self-reliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an autoflower seed, you have to buy
seeds every time and they are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autoflower feminized seeds are very
expensive compared to regular or feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like if you used regular photo
period seeds, it would change your mindset
[SPEAKER_00]: and get you away from the, I want to go
fast and be Ricky Bobby and have a crop of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in just a few weeks so that I can
have a finished product without maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would respect and appreciate
your garden a little bit better if you
[SPEAKER_00]: started off with regular photo period
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things you do not have to learn
and think about when you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the future, those things you did
not learn and the things you did not think
[SPEAKER_00]: about may be your crutch and may be what
slows you down from being the best grower
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can possibly be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want people to set themselves up
for success from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phrase you're going to hear from
me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see when a project starts,
the potential it's got of succeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell if it's going to crash and
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can quite often see that as the
project is being put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always going to be obstacles and
problems and surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be prepared for all of those
obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to foresee those surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: When shit pops up, it sets you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have set yourself up for success
the best way possible, those little
[SPEAKER_00]: obstacles will be exactly that,
tiny obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not make the proper preparation
in the beginning, that tiny obstacle can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a giant fucking hurdle later on in the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success from the
very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I want you to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to get the seeds that are going
to work for you, but I also want you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what is going to make you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How passionate are you going to be if you
buy some seeds that you don't even like
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what Rasta Jeff said to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't even enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do what is going to make you happy,
but I would love to see you learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: work a veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see you learn how to kind
of manipulate and pop and twist some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to flip the light cycle
and decide when they go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can document exactly how many
days those plants are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would get a better
relationship and a better education with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant if you chose to go with
a photo period seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do regulars or you can do
feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just recommend the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, over all of those recommendations,
I recommend you do what you want and what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you happy because that is the most
important part of growing this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the other part of
this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have said the only thing is I'm not
sure where to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I want to try autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you ask about a seed bank you could
try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that you keep hearing mixed bags
of information about them and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anyone to guide you in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you have come to the right place?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked with many of the seed
vendors that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first place I would recommend for
seeds is always going to be SeedsHereNow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: SeedsHereNow.com has a wide selection of
auto, of regular, of feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a plethora of great genetics
from seeds here now from reputable
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: SeedsHereNow carries seeds from Canorado,
from Duke Diamond, from Irie Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've also got auto flower seeds
from Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out SeedsHereNow
.com for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do not have what you are looking
for, the next place I would send you would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can
find them at DankSeed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a great selection of breeders
and genetics available on their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry Irie Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have Mephisto over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they've got Ethos Genetics over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of great stuff to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another great reputable seed vendor I
can suggest to you is Organ Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Organ Elite
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also carry many reputable,
reliable breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got Irie Genetics over there and
they've also got a link to a large
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are three people I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: SeedsHereNow.com, the Hella Dank Seed
Company at DankSeed.store, and Organ Elite
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds at Organ Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, he wraps up this email by saying,
thanks for any help you can give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know how much you are
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that means a lot to me just to know
that I am appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I have been receiving a lot of
praise through email, a lot of gratitude
[SPEAKER_00]: through social media, and my Patreon has
definitely been jingling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do notice all of the respect and
appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me and it is
reciprocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, even just being able to send this
email to you makes me hopeful about my
[SPEAKER_00]: choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I hope we're able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did say that you were in prohibition
land, but you asked your doctor about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping you were in a medical
cannabis friendly state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping maybe you can find yourself a
different doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a place where there is
medical marijuana, there is a doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: ready, willing, and able to take your
money to write you a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever they're going to write you,
there is somebody there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want your money and they will
take your money to give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got that paperwork,
that is when you need to set up to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you need to go check out those
websites and get yourself some great
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything goes well for you,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some help in the future,
if you have any questions, please reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signs the message with thanks again,
Jay Blaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jay Blaze, thank you for the great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope things go well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, now I'm just super curious
where you are because you said you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition land, but then you said you
spoke to your doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking you are in a newly medical
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions or need guidance to
find a doctor that is more compassionate
[SPEAKER_00]: and willing to help you out, send myself
or Mike an email or a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of us, if not both of us,
will get on helping you find an
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate doctor to get you your
appropriate medicine.

[SPEAKER_00]: volunteered you to help this listener find
