[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Ross Dejeff, and it is time for
episode 348 of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No fancy music or intro this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you were listening to this,
I am probably still in Denver having a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time from the holiday weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite band, Phish, was in Denver
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're listening to this on Monday,
I'm probably still in Denver hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: with some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you had a great holiday weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got to party with your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got to party with some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got to consume cannabis with a
family member, which you've never smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you found out somebody in your
family is a cannabis consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you guys snuck off and had one of them
barbecue joints together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever happened, I hope you guys had a
great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually start these episodes off by
letting you know what I am dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I am loading up a fresh dab of
Custom OG's Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, of course, a combo of Skittles
and Afgoo Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is described as assorted hard candies
on the aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cracked open this fresh jar of
concentrates, I made a little noise like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little boy that just got a fresh box of
Ninja Turtles or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, ooh, when I opened this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gram of concentrates is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I really think this is a heavy gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more than a gram of hash in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is super chunky, lots of crystals,
very little terp liquid, which is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd prefer lots of crystals and a very
minimal amount of the terpy liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get enough terps just enough to add the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gram is glorious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused me to make a little Robin
Williams noise when I opened it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting myself a little chunk of
this Custom OG's Nectar scooped into my
[SPEAKER_00]: insert here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take an insert dab,
and then after that, we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to talk a little bit
about CBD, and then we will probably read
[SPEAKER_00]: a news article, and then we may read a
couple of emails, and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap it up and get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be a super long
episode, but I wanted to make sure to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a quality show prepared for Monday,
because I haven't missed a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this show for close to
five years, I think, and I have not missed
[SPEAKER_00]: a Monday in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one Monday when I was super
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a head cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sounded like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't a Monday, but there was a show
coming up, and I wasn't able to really do
[SPEAKER_00]: a good show, so I called the crew,
and I'm sure you guys remember everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: came over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam, Jesse, and Michael came over,
and we recorded a hilarious podcast while
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically sat at the table and ran the
equipment, and everybody talked over me
[SPEAKER_00]: for the whole show, but I have not missed
a single episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In approximately five years, so I had to
make sure to come give you guys a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday show, because I'm heating the shit
out of the banger while I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear the torch in the background,
I apologize if I sound slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I'm paying attention to the
torch and the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting this sucker nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to heat it up just a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a little black mark of an
oil stain on the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat it until that goes away,
and then as soon as that's gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like it has disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn off the torch, then I drop the
insert right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right into the banger, then I get a carb
cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I place the carb cap right on top of that,
and now I'm just going to let it sit here
[SPEAKER_00]: until I see it actually starting to smoke
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the banger fills with a little smoke,
and maybe a little of the smoke comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the top of the carb cap, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I'm going to hit it,
so let's dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like the perfect size dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first pull was super thick,
nice and chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got a nice little back up pull off
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting nicely medicated from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes apple candies right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like a sour apple Jolly Rancher,
but it's kind of changing into something
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeter and fruitier as it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take a couple of seconds
for that one to work through my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys excuse me while my brain swims
around like a little goldfish in my head
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a beautiful dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, one thing I want to mention while I'm
high and just rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people taking dab videos on
Instagram, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing your big dabs on Instagram,
but when you cap the banger, leave that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab my rig so that I can
give myself a better idea of what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit that, you put the carb cap
on, and then you hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to lift the carb cap off
a little bit to carb it and let yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: clear the rig and get that smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your lungs are full, you do the ...
and then you exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear the noises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's coming through on the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull and you get this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get those little ... a couple of
moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lift the cap off to where you can get
oxygen through there so you can clear the
[SPEAKER_00]: rig and get all that smoke into your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you fill your lungs and then you
exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go back in and repeat the
process, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that ... I don't know why it
drives me fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just bugs the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're exhaling your dab,
don't take the carb cap off the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave the carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to keep removing the
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're letting the heat escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole idea of putting that carb cap on
there is to trap the heat inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: nail, inside that banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you lift the carb cap,
you're allowing all that heat to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave that carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to lift it up to clear it,
but then put it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should sound like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I'm exhaling, my carb cap is
still on the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to go back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little whistles that you hear,
the little ... That's when I lift up the
[SPEAKER_00]: banger or the carb cap to let air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of ... Just carb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's silly to cap it, trap that
heat in there, then let the cap off,
[SPEAKER_00]: let the heat escape, then try to recap it
and re-get that heat going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave it in there, your dab will be
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, it drives me fucking nuts
watching people take the cap off and leave
[SPEAKER_00]: the cap off and exhale their dab and look
at the camera all silly and blow a kiss
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put the cap on and go back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave the cap on there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now on the other hand, when you're
done with the dab, take the fucking carb
[SPEAKER_00]: cap off because when you set that rig on
the table or when you try to set the rig
[SPEAKER_00]: on the table and the carb cap falls off
and lands on the carpet and gets all that
[SPEAKER_00]: carpet fuzz stuck to the sticky carb cap,
or even worse, when the carb cap rolls off
[SPEAKER_00]: and lands on the fucking tile floor and
shatters, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the cap off when you're done and set
the cap down on an oil slick pad or pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to where people are setting the
tool so that you have just like one
[SPEAKER_00]: designated sticky spot, don't go sticky up
the whole table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to how other people are
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But set the carb cap down, then set the
rig down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if there is a mood mat or some
sort of a mat for the rig, try to set the
[SPEAKER_00]: rig on that mat because some of the
collectors and the heady boys,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you set your glass rig down directly on
the wooden table, ooh, that's offensive to
[SPEAKER_00]: some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care because I understand
it's a glass pipe that I bought that is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely going to get broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people spend a lot of money
on really nice glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sound right here, ooh,
that's a rig just touching a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hitman rig just sitting down on a
wooden table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sound drives people nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I set it down on a little
mood mat and it's nice and smooth and
[SPEAKER_00]: protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see the mood mat, try to utilize
it because your heady boyfriends may get
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated with you if you do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a little tip, you guys,
so that you look cool the first time you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the social club and smoke with all
your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the heady boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What social club?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a great segue into this news
article that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a news article from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, Denver's second
licensed social marijuana business to open
[SPEAKER_00]: this fall as a vaping bar and lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is written by a person named
John Murray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get right into it and it
goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver's licensing director signed off
Friday on the city's second license for a
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana consumption area in a business,
paving the way for a vaping bar and lounge
[SPEAKER_00]: to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fall, the owners of Vape and Play
plan to open the 21 and over social lounge
[SPEAKER_00]: and entertainment venue in November or
sooner, depending on the timing of a
[SPEAKER_00]: renovation of the building at 1753 South
Broadway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Co-owner Taylor Rosen says the lounge will
be centered around a multi-station saloon
[SPEAKER_00]: style vape bar, though customers will have
to bring their own marijuana per the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: of Denver's 2016 voter past initiative
300.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more to that article,
but I think we got the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver is opening a second consumption
bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a place for tourists to go
and consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a place for people who live
in apartments where you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to go smoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a cool social lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to have events.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it's going to be an
entertainment venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we may have music there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we may have live comedy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may do podcasts from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what could happen at a
venue like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These places are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said it's the second place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can think of two others and I'm not sure
if I should say both of them because that
[SPEAKER_00]: means one is unlicensed and we go dab
there and they may get in trouble if I
[SPEAKER_00]: mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm snitching on one of them if I say
two and I'm not sure if I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm thinking about it,
there are several places where we go and
[SPEAKER_00]: consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to click over to Google right
quick and see what the first place was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first place is I have never even been
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that the places where I am
going and dabbing, you were not supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be dabbing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't stop me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in and I sit down and I just pull out
the rig and take dabs and nobody has ever
[SPEAKER_00]: said, Hey bro, you can't dab in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the place where you are
allowed to dab is called the coffee joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first legal and officially
licensed adult use recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: lounge in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, they are called the coffee
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to give them some love,
they are on what's their address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is 1130 Yuma court in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now visitors to the Denver area,
residents of the Denver area, adults in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, visitors, guests, people have a
safe place.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go consume all of the cannabis that are
allowed to go by at the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we just need for this to spread
through Colorado now so that we can have
[SPEAKER_00]: lounges all over the place and have safe
access and safe places to consume for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you guys, I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let me rant about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working on legalizing cannabis
recreationally or medically in your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you include some sort of place
to consume your medicine or your
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis when you're writing
the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't write it into the rules from
the beginning, the opposition will create
[SPEAKER_00]: rules for you and we never like the rules
they make for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another smoke lounge in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we get them all over Colorado
before too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of the show, I mentioned we
were going to talk a little bit about CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a big scientific talk about
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more of a warning about CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hanging out with some friends a few
days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the guy's girlfriends,
I am not familiar with this couple,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were new to the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was saying that she was having some
back and leg pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other guy's girlfriends reached
into her purse really quickly and was
[SPEAKER_00]: really eager to give her some CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me being who I am, I was like,
what you got there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I see the bottle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she politely gave me the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just reading out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label looked a little generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked like they just peeled the label
off of another product and put their own
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty paper label around it and tried to
pass it off and just replace something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the label said that each capsule
contained 100 milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also said that it had MCT oil,
which I think is just fancy for coconut
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also said that it contained
fish oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as soon as I saw the words fish oil,
I got super suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked her if I could have a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were like a hundred of them in the
jar and she was super sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, yeah, take as many as you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking, yeah, I'll just pop them
in the lid and get a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pop off the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just reeked of fish oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, take as many as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a large bottle,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably a hundred of them in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dumped out two or three for myself
and I had no intentions of eating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the podcast a lot,
you know that I'm not a CBD consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD seems to kind of ruin my THC high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD isn't really for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I took a couple of them because I just
wanted to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to see what the heck she had
because she just pulled them out of her
[SPEAKER_00]: purse and was passing them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't have been very expensive the
way she was sharing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the label looked like she might have
got them at Walmart or something by the
[SPEAKER_00]: looks of this label because it didn't have
any sort of medical marijuana labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have any sort of warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just CBD oil capsules is what I
think it said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said 100 milligrams each capsule and
there were gelatin caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I flipped it around and it was
fish oil was the first ingredient listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did not define or give any
details about the CBD source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I got away from the group
because they didn't want to be rude and
[SPEAKER_00]: just crack it open and tell this girl your
product is shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could tell her product was shit and
I just had a suspicion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cracked it open and I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I think that they're just
selling fish oil pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only reason I can think of why
they would say there's fish oil in there
[SPEAKER_00]: because why the fuck else would you put
fish oil in CBD pills?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking they're just relabeling
some fish oil pills and they're selling
[SPEAKER_00]: them to this very sweet young lady who's
very gullible and very young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's buying them thinking that she's
got CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the added benefit to taking this fish
oil is it's probably giving her some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of physical benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably good for her joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be good for her brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably good for all kinds of stuff
in her body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's attributing that to the magical
effects of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's not getting a placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's getting an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's going to keep buying this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't prove to you that there's no CBD
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't eat the pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of melted in my car to be honest
with you after I cracked one of them open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about them in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two melted in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm very suspicious of what they're
putting in that capsule and telling us is
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think for the cost of that bottle
that could have been CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think for how generous she was
with that bottle that those were CBD pills
[SPEAKER_00]: because that would probably be really
expensive for a bottle that big of 100
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram CBD pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it leads me for what I'm trying to
say to you guys is when you're buying CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: products be very leery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very suspicious of any CBD products
right now you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find out about the company you're
purchasing from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find out the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research on the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out where their products come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they coming from America?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they coming from Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they coming from the United States?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said that one already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they coming from China is what I'm
getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to say China first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's coming from China be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's coming from Canada you're probably
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's coming from America it's hard to
say what you're purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you buy your CBD
products from a very reputable vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Giddy up on the podcast recently
and he represents CanTech Labs so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: stand behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also several other reputable
companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to throw out a bunch of
names because I haven't done any research
[SPEAKER_00]: and as soon as I say a brand name
especially the two that are on the tip of
[SPEAKER_00]: my tongue if I say those I'm going to get
10 emails about why I shouldn't have said
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to say anybody other than
our friends at CanTech Labs because Giddy
[SPEAKER_00]: up was on the show and I've actually seen
those products work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giddy gave me a few samples of their CBD
products and I passed them out to people
[SPEAKER_00]: who needed them and I did watch that
product work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it work for somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk too much about it because
their employment would probably frown upon
[SPEAKER_00]: their CBD use but I got to see somebody
get relief from a CBD product so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's CanTech Labs and they're based out of
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Giddy up and his crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing I want to talk about is
I wonder what other people are taking that
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually think is CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're getting their CBD from China if
they're getting like a little vial of
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture or a little medicine bottle
filled with some syrup that they think is
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD I wonder what these people are putting
into their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are simply taking doses of
fish oil every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are taking water with
little drops of hemp oil in it every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are paying good money and
thinking that they're treating themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: well and treating a condition when they're
actually being duped into spending their
[SPEAKER_00]: money on a product that could be causing
them more harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That scares the shit out of me you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if the CBD isn't real, even if it's
just fish oil that's shitty to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what else is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the super shitty part because I'm
not going to say that China is
[SPEAKER_00]: unscrupulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the word unscrupulous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah China I'm not gonna but I mean they
don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting some shit in a bottle and
they're putting it in a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a label on it and they ship it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea where it ends up or what
it's gonna do to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well they got paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what they're putting in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember a long time ago Chinese
toothpaste was killing people?
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine like what Chinese CBD might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright you guys I think I've rambled on
long enough about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to where your CBD comes
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they a reputable company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they a piece of shit company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if they are American,
Canadian, Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where they could be from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Scotty Real will always remind
you, you vote with your dollars man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to where your CBD is
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give your money to a company that
doesn't give a shit about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do give your money to a company
that actually cares and offers a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright you guys I said this was gonna be
a quick episode and I'm already creeping
[SPEAKER_00]: up on almost 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's read one quick email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email says, Hey Jeff I'm growing in
my closet for the first time and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to a veg podcast of yours
talking about turning off the lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting the plants sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time could I also keep the fan
off or is the fan okay to run during that
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recommended giving your plants some
sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to run the plants
with 24 hours of veg light so they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the plants really like some
sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do some processing in the sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna get too much into that
because I'm trying to keep this short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also roots develop in the dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of root growth at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a little bit of dark time is
good for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really encourages them growth and who
doesn't want a nap occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it lets your lights cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save you some electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save you some bulb time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this guy is asking should I leave the
fan off or can I keep that on during the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would leave the fan on during the dark
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get more humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as those lights go off the
vapor pressure deficit is going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relative humidity is going to spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna go crazy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in there so you don't notice
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it happens every time the lights go
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes drastically in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got that fan in there that
will help prevent any sort of bud mold and
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also those leaves just like to move
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves want to get rustled around all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not beating the shit out of the
plants with that fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just a nice rustling muscle yeah
go ahead and leave that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they will like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe think about turning it off and on
intermittently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have it come on for maybe on for 15
minutes off for 15 minutes on for 15 off
[SPEAKER_00]: for 15 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if you've got a couple of leaves
it's always that front row of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That front row right in front of the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always the leaves look just a little
bit shitty from getting beat up by the fan
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the vapor pressure deficit getting
just thrown out of whack by that fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't beat the shit out of them all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give them a little bit of a rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they can actually function so that
those leaves can do their duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the vapor pressure deficit
correct around those leaves for at least
[SPEAKER_00]: half the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes if you want to leave that fan on
if it's not too strong if it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: whipping the shit out of your plants if
it's not causing any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes leave it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of stimulation is not a
problem throughout the night cycle for
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great question dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a question
you can send me an email.

out.
