Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is episode 649 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a

Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend Tartan Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course there is a link in the show
notes and the video description to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a couple of internet
questions I have received from YouTube and
[SPEAKER_00]: from a couple of emails real quick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been asking why I don't smoke
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis based show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about smoking a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I tell you what I just
smoked, but why don't I smoke on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I smoked plenty right before
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a couple of fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up the camera and I take a couple of
more dabs and make sure everything's all
[SPEAKER_00]: rocking and rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a quick little mic check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I start recording once I get my voice
recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get plenty dabbed out before I start
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to stop talking and take a
couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets me to my second reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to stop talking and take
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm plenty lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to teach you guys and give you a
quality podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I stop and take a dab or smoke a bowl
in the middle, that would probably take
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the quality of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would definitely derail my focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just try to stay focused and keep
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice when I do have a guest,
when Mike is on or somebody else is here,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're talking, I do puff a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my intention for that is to keep my
hands busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got ADD and I don't know what to do with
my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just keeping my hands moving when
other people are here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it helps me to stay calm and not
interrupt so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm smoking, a lot of times my ADD
tells me to chime in and say something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found that if I let a guest talk,
they'll tell me what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really need to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoke while they're talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I do smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason I don't smoke,
though, honestly, is because YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes will flag a video with
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am more likely to get my videos taken
down, my videos flagged, something
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupted by YouTube because of
consumption in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing my best to keep these videos
up on YouTube, keep the channel clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my main reason, honestly,
for not mass consumption here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know, we may have a multiple
person show here in the future where we
[SPEAKER_00]: just bust out and smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I don't smoke
because dabbing and smoking gives me that
[SPEAKER_00]: in my throat and nobody wants that shit in
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm here to teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to just keep talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to watch me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you do want to watch me smoke,
but that'll be my next point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you a quality podcast
without getting the channel deleted is my
[SPEAKER_00]: main reason why I don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the show, the next point, if you do
want to hang out and watch me smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: join me on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday at seven 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here in the Colorado time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what time zone you were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Monday afternoon, Monday evening,
I guess it is at seven p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain time around seven 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jump on some time between seven and
seven 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually about seven 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jump on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Instagram is I re underscore genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I are IE underscore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can spell genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give me a follow there every
Monday, approximately seven 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hop on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to say hi to everybody that comes
into the live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every name I see pop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to greet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come in my door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to say what's up to you personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes Instagram doesn't show me that
you popped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it'll say, let's see,
Riven Waters and seven other people have
[SPEAKER_00]: popped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say hi to seven other because
I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on that Instagram live show,
I will smoke plenty of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read all of the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer a bunch of questions and I
will smoke a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We listen to music, we hang out,
we talk shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a good smoke session and a
hangout session is nowhere, nowhere near
[SPEAKER_00]: as formal as this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all freestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions are all just shot to me
randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to answer them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point here, if you want to hang out
and smoke with me, if you want to watch me
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke, take fat dabs, get too stoned,
I get silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I, I really get chilled out on
that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke until I have to stop and go get
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Monday nights on Instagram,
give me a follow on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re underscore genetics leads me to one
more segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re the word is I re a lot of people call
it eerie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to call it eerie, it is a
little creepy, but the word is I re I re
[SPEAKER_00]: is a Jamaican word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means to just feel the best you could
feel to mean it means to feel blessed and
[SPEAKER_00]: just good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just feeling I re, you know, when you're
sitting for me, it's like on a hill,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a nice hillside with a little breeze
coming toward me, a nice grassy hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you sit in the grass,
the grass is just naturally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how hot it is outside,
that grass just feels good and cool on
[SPEAKER_00]: your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your feet, your bare feet in that
grass, rub your toes in the grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: your butts on the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got clothes on guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got clothes on, but my butts on the
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my palms touching that grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of breeze blowing my
dreadlocks out of my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just kind of like, damn,
it's bright, but you're not squinting and
[SPEAKER_00]: dying from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just maybe overlooking some
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got your dog next to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got your your partner with you,
maybe your best friend, maybe your lover,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe your boyfriend, girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking twenty twenty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have whatever you want next to you
that makes you feel the happiest you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: that feeling right there when you're just
chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got a white claw in your hand
because it's twenty twenty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm drinking a kombucha.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is feeling I re just when you
feel good, when the reggae music is
[SPEAKER_00]: playing at the concert and you're just
bobbing your head and everybody's bobbing
[SPEAKER_00]: their head and the smoke's in the air and
the sun is setting behind the stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: the reggae stars are dancing and the
lights are popping up off the stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just like, yeah, that feeling that
is I re that's what I re means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re I'm sure you've heard it in reggae
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard it in Jamaican music.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've gone to a reggae show,
the reggae singer has said the word I re
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are feeling I re they're
making you feel I re.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've said it enough times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not eerie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word is I re I re genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm inspired by a lot of Rastafari
Jamaican culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also find a lot of Grateful Dead
references in my strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I wanted to say I re genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long ramble about the word I
re.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got to got to teach the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another question I get often asked is
why is the podcast age restricted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm trying to keep the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say the F word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drop a lot of fucking profane language
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to edit myself back in the day,
but I found that I say fuck and there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to cut that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something that I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we must make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be what's the word age
restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are under the age of 18
probably I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they shouldn't be learning about
cannabis right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's somebody's it's their
parents responsibility until they're 18 to
[SPEAKER_00]: teach them about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day after that, I'll teach you
everything you want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, it's your parents
responsibility to teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the technical legal shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's age restricted on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need little kids seeing the
channel and leaving comments and telling
[SPEAKER_00]: their mom, hey, I want to take dabs and be
like Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we keep it age restricted for the
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is change on your
Google account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your age to over 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better be 18 if you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all you've got to do is go put in your
birthday and change it and it will let you
[SPEAKER_00]: sign in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told me that YouTube wanted their
credit card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, you're doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube does not want your credit card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably not even seeing this
because you couldn't get that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But YouTube is age restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to keep my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if it were not age restricted,
little kids saw this might get me in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble, not in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get the channel taken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to be able to watch the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to post the videos other places
and it doesn't get any views and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks for loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to do it on the
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to keep the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not gotten to the main cannabis
portion of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some great questions from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from the Patreon
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want their name said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it right in the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to start by reading
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, actually, I think I have two
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got two emails with the same
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one comes from it says,
what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Papa Z here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are welcome to use my name on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for everything you do
for all of us who strive to be better
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and just plain better in life,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm making you a better grower
and I'm glad it is making you be a better
[SPEAKER_00]: person in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I won't ramble on as you usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, because I've done enough of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, here is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just popped a pack of strawberry
starburst, and I want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your opinion, is it better to take a
cutting as soon as I am able from each
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling and then plant that cutting after
it roots and flip that and find the males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very reasonable method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or should I just flip the seedling and
then switch it back to veg after finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the male show that finding them show their
sex?
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are freaking epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did post some videos on topping and
cloning, and people have made a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: comments on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for watching the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer, the short, oh, he wraps it up
with much love and job guide from Papa Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: My short answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read another question that is
very similar to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we are going to give you
some answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read this next question and we'll
delve deeper into the answer to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a Michigan resident, we are now
limited to 12 plants for recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to maximize these gorilla
cookie seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys didn't just hear my
stomach rumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if that came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody feed the hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these gorilla cookie seeds I was
given from a friend in order to audition
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants before going outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very wise move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have listened to my podcast
previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate it when people put plants outside
that they have not auditioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know if that plant's a male
or a female, please don't put it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pollinate all the other outdoor
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person has the right idea before
putting it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking I would start them inside
my tent and veg for eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have good size plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip to flower and weed out the male since
I'm not breeding or looking to fuck up
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good forethought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then re-veg the females to go
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to stress the girls too much
or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the bottom of your question,
bro, I wrote the word perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Audition them before you put them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait to see what the males are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then re-veg the females and put the
females outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very beautiful strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar to the question we
were asked previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's delve into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the same answer,
the same question here for both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question is I'm trying to
determine how to sex my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to find the quickest ways of
sexing their plants to determine if
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got males or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way we don't waste time putting,
this guy is going to put their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to veg for eight weeks and then
put them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put those giant plants outside,
they're going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start to turn, they show their
sex on you, that could pollinate the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to put that male outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our other friend is going to be growing in
a tent and wants to make the best out of
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want to waste space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very reasonable, reasonable expectations
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend for my friend who's
going to go outdoors and would also work
[SPEAKER_00]: for Papa Z, I would take a clone from
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to veg for eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could probably top around week three
and get a good clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to bush out and it's going to
make a top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've showed you this part on video before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that top and make a clone out of the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have another space, this is what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the clone out of the top of each of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label your plants, plant A, plant B,
plant C, however many you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 10 of them, do numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 12, do numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do numbers, one through 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take a clone and label your clones
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone one, clone two so that they match up
with the plant it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put those clones under 12,
12 lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones will begin to root and while
they are rooting, they will show you if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're male or female in about 10,
12, maybe 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you don't have to veg giant
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to veg them out for five
extra weeks should they be boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get rid of them even sooner than
flipping the plants, putting them into
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, and then finding out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sooner you can flip them into
flower, or cut a clone would be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them get too big, then do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it when they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it as soon as you have a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean by when it goes from
a seedling to looking like a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you think it's an actual plant,
then put that fucker into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only going to be a foot tall,
10 inches tall, and they're going to be 14
[SPEAKER_00]: inches tall by the time you find out
they're into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put it back into veg and then up pot
it and it will revedge more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll save you time, save you some
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that second space,
you can do the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, flower out that original mom plant
and find out what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't grow it so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate wasting time, space, energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have put different plants in there
and had a whole new project underway had I
[SPEAKER_00]: known that that one big pot was wasting
all my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real estate's expensive in a grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to lean back over here to
Papa Z's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, is it better to take a
cutting as soon as I'm able and then plant
[SPEAKER_00]: the cutting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it roots and then flip that to find the
males or flip the seedlings?
[SPEAKER_00]: So about three weeks into veg,
take a clone if you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, we take cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take cuttings about three weeks into
veg, take a cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got this big mom plant and
you've got the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can at that point put that cutting
into a flower immediately and it will show
[SPEAKER_00]: you which ones are the males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can toss the males immediately if
you want to, and you can keep the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've already got backup clones of
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a mother plant for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one of these plants turns out to be
stellar and you want to keep it forever,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe you just don't have more plants
to grow, maybe you want to keep something
[SPEAKER_00]: around to grow in the future so you don't
have to keep popping seeds and sexing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you can find one that's reliable,
then you've got a clone for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already there in the clone dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one thing that is very
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a clone of each of those
plants and you put them into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will show you sex about the same time
frame that it would take if you put the
[SPEAKER_00]: original plant into flower and then let it
show you sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take about the same amount
of time, 10, 12, maybe 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it with the main plant,
then you've got to reveg it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it with the clones, there's no
reveg happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the option in this case,
I would probably take the clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: flower those out, find the males,
pull the males, and that way you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the main mommy or the main plant that
you started with is not in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to revert it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take you a week or two to
get it back into the vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to reveg it, then it's
going to regrow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense of what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, all of your methods
would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your ideas would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what is best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut clones, then you can either
flip the clone, you can either flip the
[SPEAKER_00]: mom, or you can flip and return the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just put the mom into the
flowering room and let them go,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you just pull them out and chop
them down and throw them away at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find out that it's a male or a
female, or you keep the females is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let the females keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a boy, you just chop it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you just got that big plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just running the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: An experienced grower can spot the boys
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just go pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a female and you didn't get
clones at that point, you could pull it
[SPEAKER_00]: out, put it back in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a clone and flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip the mom and let it go, or flip the
mom until it shows you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then reveg it are the options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of you guys have a great strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all about deciding what works
best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both of you guys are option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Round week three, take a clone and put
that tray of clones into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 14 days, you'll know what you've got if
you have the extra space to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend that's going outdoors,
I would recommend that you flower those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants a little bit earlier than you
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they got time to reveg and you
don't waste so much time and space with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to water it, feed it,
take care of it, waste space with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is indeed a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time for two emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered a lot of questions for
you guys there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I jump into this next one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we've got plenty of time to jump into
this next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one comes from my friend Zachary
and it came from Patreon at patreon.com
[SPEAKER_00]: forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't slur like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought of another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using CO2 mushroom bags for
shits and giggles and I can honestly say
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have no idea if it helped or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't quantify results in some sort
of way, it was not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just donated money to that company is
basically what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you use a meter or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I measured the CO2 in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I keep close attention to my
ladies and I visit these hoes every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a pretty steady pattern about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, do you use CO2
supplementation and what are the factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that would make it worth it from a tent
grower to a building sized operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: The factors in mind here are obvious
temperature humidity, but also a room
[SPEAKER_00]: being sealed enough air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to touch on already.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does say side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing three breeder seeds,
including yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I'm seeing so far,
yours are killing it in my tent
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those extra seeds you gave me went to
some growers in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to wrap up that message
because it says that my seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: outperforming other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also shows that I gave you extra
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing that with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on this question here,
talking about CO2 in a room, a sealed room
[SPEAKER_00]: is a big factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that CO2 going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you exhausting your tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we put a blower at the
top of the tent or a carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere near the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exhausting the air out of the top,
blowing it out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that ducting go out of a window,
out of the domicile, out of the building,
[SPEAKER_00]: or does it blow the air back into the
office space, bedroom, living room,
[SPEAKER_00]: basement, attic, wherever you might have
this grow tent, is that air being blown
[SPEAKER_00]: back into there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going out the window, your CO2 is
now out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just CO2ed up the neighborhood with a
mushroom bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You honestly probably didn't do shit,
but you blew the CO2 right out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had the ducting going out the
window, if you're blowing that air back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the room, it had the opportunity to
get sucked in through the passive vents on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you've got an active intake near
the bottom of that tent, but possibly some
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, a portion of it got sucked back in
through the bottom and then cycled back up
[SPEAKER_00]: through your tent again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it mixed into the rest of the
atmosphere in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much airflow is in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a door open?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a window open?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that door open to the rest of the
house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that tent in a 9,000 square foot
warehouse by itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it in a five by seven bedroom that is
stifled?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be huge factors that
come into play to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cubic feet, amount of fucking CO2 you've
introduced into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about the cycling and
recycling and the amount of sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just blowing it out the window,
you're literally just blowing it out the
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's sealed in there and there's
nowhere for it to go, it's circling back
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also that tells me that your room is
probably too hot and probably kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, unless you've got the appropriate
equipment in there to combat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to aim for fairly high PPMs in a,
so in my personal grows, I do not run CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extra work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a couple of extra strip trips to the
growth store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my plants are the plants I'm
working with are high performance plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always tell me my plants veg
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flower with much more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of CO2 may make my plants go
too fast and mess up my whole schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my stuff is in a small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal stuff is in a very small
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel the need to augment the CO2
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, most of what I'm breeding for is for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get bigger plants with faster growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried on that big accelerated
bud growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want healthy seeds, so that's mainly
what I focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow environment,
I CO2 up those rooms heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between 1,000 and 1,400 PPMs,
just depending on what part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle we are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In veg, I stay around 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the flowering times, we'll crank it up
to about 1,400 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets quite expensive to augment CO2 in
a large environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if, if I notice that we can't keep it
up, if we need more CO2 being dumped into
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, then it's cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll simply just keep the PPMs closer to
1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can keep it in the room,
if it's a smaller room, better sealed,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, better airflow, that's when I'll crank
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, kind of in the later weeks of flower,
not the final weeks, but the later weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower, I'll really crank up that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the factors are, it's all about
sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you, how are you providing the
CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it coming from a burner?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's coming from a burner, you were
just limited by the performance of that
[SPEAKER_00]: burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you end the heat that it puts off as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you turn that bitch up enough to
saturate the room at the desired level,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with the amount of sealed,
uh, sealing that you've done in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tanks, uh, that gets
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to refill the tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you saturate the room with CO2 at the
level you desire and maintain those tanks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get to the store as often as you
need to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you carry in those tanks as often as
you need to without your neighbors seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: you, uh, CO2 tanks being carried into the
house looks super fucking sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize you may use CO2 for a
cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think you're doing something way
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids in the neighborhood are going to
think you got helium and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want fucking helium balloons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got that CO2 tank, uh,
you're going to have to move that into the
[SPEAKER_00]: house a couple of times a week or a couple
of times a month or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to move that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room is not sealed properly,
uh, you're just ducting that shit right
[SPEAKER_00]: out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just drove, picked it up, snuck it
into the house, paid for it, hooked it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and then vented it right out the damn
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're sealing the room,
that is not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the other methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of creating CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the tanks, we got the burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we got these mushroom bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know if those are
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're getting out a meter,
you said you do not use a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're getting out a meter,
there's no real way to measure the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of CO2 in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of meters in the commercial
environment that tell me what the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the CO2 is throughout the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got it set up to where if the CO2
is too high here, too low here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll actually turn on in this region and
not in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans will kick on and move CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty advanced room in some of
these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've got to have the meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have these big meters that if it
gets dangerously high, the fucking alarms
[SPEAKER_00]: go off and it tells us to leave the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, had that happen once almost shit my
pants scared the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but we do have a lot of CO2 monitoring
in the commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to pay for the juice,
you got to monitor the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get the equipment that goes
with it, or you don't even know if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some sort of quantifiable data,
also quantifiable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put that in there and you didn't
get any results out of it, it was not cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, which means it didn't do,
it wasn't cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do it again unless you got more
out of spending more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it again, unless the quality is
better and you were not looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think quality is going to be
better because of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just looking for bigger fatter
plants, bigger fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you need a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would optimize the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent is in a room in your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would optimize the room in which the
tent is in because that room is working as
[SPEAKER_00]: a long room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your main environment in the
tent and then outside the air gets to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: around again and kind of stabilize itself
to the room temperature, which was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be whatever ambient environment is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a hot day, it's going to be hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cool, it's going to be cool,
but it's getting to mix in there again and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stabilize itself before it gets
sucked back into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep that room closed and keep
the CO2 augmented in that room as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, uh, adjust the
temperature and humidity of the room in
[SPEAKER_00]: which the tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't put my air conditioner in the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put it in the bedroom,
which the tent is in, put my humidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: and dehumidifier in that room,
adjust that temperature and then blow that
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect air into the tent and then suck
out the bad air out of the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be augmenting the CO2 in that big
room as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds silly, but from a
commercial grower standpoint, from a very
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced grower standpoint,
that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what you're going to have to do at
that point is make sure that room is
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you evacuating air out of that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow are people opening the door coming
in and out of that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an active house in the,
or an active room in the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: this may not be the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just want to rock it without CO2
or just be the guy that puts a little tank
[SPEAKER_00]: right outside there and runs the lines
into right into the tent and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: drops that CO2 right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could get wasteful, uh, but it's going
right to the plants that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just try not to waste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cost effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need quantifiable data run two or three
harvests of the same strain of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the same amount of time with the same
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it to be scientific,
you have to do it scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you can't seal that room up the way
I said before, put the tanks right outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tent, run your lines right inside
the tent and run that perforated drip line
[SPEAKER_00]: right above the plants, like six or eight
inches above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a loop all the way around that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do a cross across the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can run the lines that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that CO2 is dropping right into the
canopy of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your extraction fan will suck it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heavier than oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to fall when that extraction
fan comes on or pull it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it sucks it into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that extraction fan is pulling
passive air into the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, like I said before,
it brings it right back into that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it recycles with the air outside,
um, you're going to need meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my main advice, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a meter and see what the meter says.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to start off around
350 to 420 PPMs of CO2 in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's naturally what the environment
seems to be lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, see what you can do by augmenting it
with these cheap bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you want to invest in more
expensive equipment, pumping up the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get it high and you get a good
pattern and figure out what each strain
[SPEAKER_00]: likes, it will increase your bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make the plants beef up,
bulk up, fatten up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice faster growth because of
that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wrote a high PPM show results,
but is it cost effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main thing to think about cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not cost effective, cut it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to find out is to seal up
that room, let that shit rip and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
