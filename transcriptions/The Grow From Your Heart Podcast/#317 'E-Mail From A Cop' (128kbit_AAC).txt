[SPEAKER_00]: podcast what's up cannabis community it's
time for episode 317 of the grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast thanks again for joining me
you guys I just woke up from a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: nap our friends from organica stopped by
and we got a little bit lit up I may have
[SPEAKER_00]: eaten too many edibles I may have taken
too many dabs but I am back on my feet I
[SPEAKER_00]: am ready to do a podcast I like to start
the episode off by letting you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: am dabbing on today I dabbed a little bit
of everything but what's gonna happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna tell you about this then I'm
gonna press pause and take a dab and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna do a podcast I am about to
take a dab of some stuff called clementine
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies from viola extracts I picked this
up at doctors orders on stem beach doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: orders was having a sale on the green dot
black label and I stopped in for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the green dot I saw the viola labs
products on sale they had a jar on the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter and it was called clementine
cookies I took a smell of it and before I
[SPEAKER_00]: could set the jar down my mouth said I'll
take a gram of this please this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: smells amazing you guys I'm gonna give it
a sniff right now and try to describe it
[SPEAKER_00]: to you so I can certainly smell the Girl
Scout cookies Girl Scout cookies has a
[SPEAKER_00]: spiciness to it I think it's got a black
pepper kind of a spicy sort of a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a little bit of a sharp astringent
sort of a smell which is honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious and I love it that is dominant
in the aroma of this concentrate but right
[SPEAKER_00]: under that there's a this candy sweet
bottom from the clementine it's like spicy
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious oranges and it smells amazing
the amount of turps to crystals was
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect in here I think it was probably
70% crystals and 30% turps I really like
[SPEAKER_00]: the texture of it the flavor was super
nice the high was amazing it came on super
[SPEAKER_00]: fast and it went right to my head right to
my eyes it made my eyes feel all droopy it
[SPEAKER_00]: made my head feel all fuzzy I guess I
would describe it more of a stoned than a
[SPEAKER_00]: high because I just wanted to chill out I
just wanted to stare into nothing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of minutes so this was kind of an
impulse buy and I am completely satisfied
[SPEAKER_00]: with the clementine cookies live resin
from viola extracts great work you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: now since I've hyped it up so much I think
I'm going to press pause and take a big
[SPEAKER_00]: fat dab and then we're gonna come back
with an email from a cop alright podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: world I am back I am heavily medicated I
just took a fat dab of the clementine
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies live resin from viola extracts it
tastes better than I remembered and the
[SPEAKER_00]: high went straight to my brain one thing I
did notice I took the dab off of a rig
[SPEAKER_00]: with a smaller mouthpiece I am learning
that I prefer a larger flared out
[SPEAKER_00]: mouthpiece too little of a mouthpiece if
you have to make that kissy face with your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth I feel like it makes your lips all
sticky if you take a large dab so larger
[SPEAKER_00]: mouthpieces for larger dabs that's my
opinion that's my advice I still want a
[SPEAKER_00]: small rig but a flared out wider
mouthpiece for less stickiness in my
[SPEAKER_00]: mustache and on my teeth alright you guys
I'm obviously heavily medicated before I
[SPEAKER_00]: took this dab break I teased that we were
gonna read an email from a cop and you
[SPEAKER_00]: might say how do you know it's from a cop
well I was checking my email a few days
[SPEAKER_00]: ago and I saw the subject line greetings
from a cop so I skipped everything else I
[SPEAKER_00]: was working on and I scrolled right down
and I opened up the email from my new cop
[SPEAKER_00]: friend and it goes just like this it says
hey Rasta Jeff first off thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing podcast hey dude you're very
welcome thank you for the amazing email he
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps going he says I've just recently
started listening to it and I'm going back
[SPEAKER_00]: over old episodes about three to five
hours daily wow that's a lot of listening
[SPEAKER_00]: man thank you thanks for the support also
if you've caught up on all the episodes on
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes and Stitcher all of the episodes
are available on YouTube so if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: old old content you can go to the YouTube
channel go to YouTube type in grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart podcast or bring up the YouTube
channel and you can find all of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes that way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel if more police officers had
this approach to their job that more
[SPEAKER_00]: people would respect the police and the
community would get along with the police
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit better I don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: because not all of us are doing okay
financially excused or overlooked if
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody's hurting anybody I don't see a
reason there's no crime if nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting hurt if nobody's causing a problem
there's no reason to fuck up somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: life and so I respect an officer that can
use situational awareness and judgment and
[SPEAKER_00]: not cause a problem for somebody so man a
lot of respect to you for that thank you I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate you for that not all cops are
bad we got to keep that in mind I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep reading the email because I'm super
rambly after the dabs I just took the
[SPEAKER_00]: email goes on to say about two years ago I
had a terrible injury at work fighting a
[SPEAKER_00]: man that I was arresting after
investigating how he had molested a
[SPEAKER_00]: three-year-old boy and I have had three
major surgeries and five giant needle
[SPEAKER_00]: injections man that's a huge sentence
there's a lot of stuff to absorb in that
[SPEAKER_00]: one so you had a terrible injury at work
fighting a man that you arrested because
[SPEAKER_00]: he had molested a three-year-old boy so
that's a lot of mental stuff to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all you know that this man was
doing some terribleness and you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: arrest him and then when that went down he
tried to physically fight you where you
[SPEAKER_00]: got injured and it changed your life and
since then you've had three surgeries
[SPEAKER_00]: probably all three of those are traumatic
and five giant needle injections saying
[SPEAKER_00]: the phrase five giant needle injections
makes my toes curl every time I say it so
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like you've been through a lot
man it sounds like you're going through a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot and it sounds like you were trying to
be a good cop so that's terrible that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is sort of the hand you were dealt for
being a good cop I want to keep reading
[SPEAKER_00]: your message it says
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard this story a lot and I kind of
know how that goes it seems like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people get injured a lot of good folks get
injured they go to the doctor they end up
[SPEAKER_00]: getting put on these pills and it turns
their life around it's not the injury it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not the depression it's not the change of
life it's the pills that these doctors are
[SPEAKER_00]: giving people that seems to send them down
a dark path he continues to say really not
[SPEAKER_00]: fun and I'm glad to be alive on this side
of pain pills after nearly a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half of either 24 7 pain or opiate-induced
stupor I got a CBD vape this is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: story starts to change you guys I used
that for about a week and decided f it
[SPEAKER_00]: give me the real thing so this guy was in
pain he was in an opiate-induced stupor
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy wasn't himself anymore he
probably wasn't enjoying life his family
[SPEAKER_00]: probably wasn't enjoying him he wasn't
happy anymore he was just a zombie because
[SPEAKER_00]: of these doctors just pumping him up with
pain pills so he got himself a CBD vape
[SPEAKER_00]: and it sounds like it was working for a
little bit and then he decided f it give
[SPEAKER_00]: me the real thing and that's where he goes
on to say cannabis has literally saved me
[SPEAKER_00]: from pills cannabis has about the same
pain relieving qualities as pills but
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis does not leave me depressed after
I can say the biggest side effect I see is
[SPEAKER_00]: the munchies see the biggest side effect
which isn't even I don't believe in side
[SPEAKER_00]: effect I think that is an effect because
you can't separate the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: something if you just said what does it do
to you he says it makes me stoned it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: me forget things it makes me kind of chill
out it also makes me hungry that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect not a side effect in my opinion
sorry random rant but the worst effect he
[SPEAKER_00]: got from it was the munchies and for
somebody who has been laid up for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while and who has been in pain and who has
been on narcotic pills that are making
[SPEAKER_00]: them a zombie the munchies probably isn't
a bad thing you're probably a little
[SPEAKER_00]: emaciated you could probably use a couple
of snacks honestly but also he says that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis does not leave him depressed
like the pain pills did and also they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing liver damage they're not doing
kidney damage and they're not making you a
[SPEAKER_00]: zombie they're leaving you functional
you've got the munchies that's not too bad
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you're not handling those
munchies with cartons of Ben and Jerry's
[SPEAKER_00]: ice cream and snickers bars as long as
you're treating that properly maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: got some some avocado slices or some
hard-boiled eggs maybe you got you some
[SPEAKER_00]: ants on a log maybe you got some celery
and peanut butter with raisins on it like
[SPEAKER_00]: a big kid i don't know hopefully you're
doing something good to take care of those
[SPEAKER_00]: munchies but that's if that's the worst
effect that's coming from it and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting depressed you're not getting
your liver torn up you're not getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach burnt up and you're not acting
like a zombie and you're functional eat
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to eat maybe you get you
a little gut you're gonna be all right he
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps on going and says i recently started
growing my own cannabis i can't really do
[SPEAKER_00]: much physical activities due to my injury
but i am able to garden i really think
[SPEAKER_00]: that growing your own cannabis is going to
make you feel better i didn't spray this
[SPEAKER_00]: with any weird shit i didn't do anything
stupid to this i know what's in this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and it's such a good feeling so
let me continue with the email he says i
[SPEAKER_00]: am able to garden and i have an organic
outdoor setup that is awesome to hear man
[SPEAKER_00]: i hope you got to listen to the episodes
with sean i hope you listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes with jesse if you have questions
about that send me an email he says i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in smart pots so far things are
small but happy man that's the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it for a personal garden don't go uh
don't get yourself in over your head he
[SPEAKER_00]: says i'm gonna read that sentence again
you guys because this is tremendous he
[SPEAKER_00]: says cannabis has saved another life you
guys learning about cannabis has saved
[SPEAKER_00]: this person's life so shout out to
cannabis thank you to cannabis once again
[SPEAKER_00]: he says
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys this guy is not drinking or
taking pills and he is consuming cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and his mental and physical state have
drastically improved cannabis you guys i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to preach to the choir right
most of the people listening are already
[SPEAKER_00]: going yeah ross to jeff we're on your team
you guys i love hearing messages like this
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter how many times i hear this it

[SPEAKER_00]: in me it makes me feel good about being a
spokesperson or an ambassador for this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it really uh it puts pride in me

being a part of my life and giving me this
[SPEAKER_00]: enriching podcast hey man thank you for
this great email you are very welcome um i
[SPEAKER_00]: am glad you didn't do anything ridiculous
when you were in those dark depressed days
[SPEAKER_00]: to be quite honest excuse me for all the
throat problems you guys we're gonna blame
[SPEAKER_00]: that on the viola extracts here uh to be
quite honest i had a traumatic brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury a couple maybe three years ago and
there were times i couldn't figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to tie my shoes there were times i would
be brushing my teeth and couldn't figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out why i was standing in the kitchen with
her in the bathroom see i'm still doing
[SPEAKER_00]: weird shit why i was standing in the
bathroom with a mouthful of weird shit
[SPEAKER_00]: there were times when the thought of
ending everything would pass through my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind but i knew that it was just because
my brain was broken and it wasn't working
[SPEAKER_00]: right so i'm proud of you and i'm happy
that you made it through that thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for sticking through it and battling
through that with us and being on team
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with us now you wouldn't have
been able to be a good spokesperson for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis so thank you for making it
through that thank you for enduring and
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for being part of team cannabis
thank you for having an open mind and
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing that cannabis could be part of
what would help you so you're very welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: is what i'm trying to say and thank you
for the great email he goes on to say
[SPEAKER_00]: hey blue went green thank you for the
wonderful email messages like this are
[SPEAKER_00]: part of why i do this podcast knowing that
i'm helping people change their lives
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly helping you save your life this
makes all of the time the energy the
[SPEAKER_00]: effort the frustration sometimes the
struggle it's all worth it because of
[SPEAKER_00]: messages like this i really appreciate
that so you said that you would be happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to answer any questions about law
enforcement i don't have a question about
[SPEAKER_00]: law enforcement my question is now that
you have personally experienced the
[SPEAKER_00]: healing qualities and properties of
cannabis are you going to or have you been
[SPEAKER_00]: educating your fellow law enforcement have
you been advocating in any way saying hey
[SPEAKER_00]: guys we may be looking at this all wrong
have you done anything like that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: your duty you've done your duty trust me
but it would be cool if you could say some
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that to some of your cop
friends maybe don't even approach them
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe just bring it up you know when
you're at lunch with them or when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: on the phone with them or i don't know i'm
curious if you're open about it with your
[SPEAKER_00]: law enforcement friends i'm curious what
you're going to do in the future about
[SPEAKER_00]: that and are you going to advocate for
cannabis just curious send me another
[SPEAKER_00]: email and we'll talk about it on a future
episode hey again man blue went green
[SPEAKER_00]: really i appreciate your service i
appreciate your attitude and i definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the great email i hope things
go well for you if you need anything send
[SPEAKER_00]: me an email i'd be happy to help you out
all right podcast world i received a
[SPEAKER_00]: message on instagram and somebody was
asking me what is the difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that medical and recreational cannabis
are grown here in colorado they said
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the difference if any and my answer
was pretty simple i said there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: difference you guys a lot of people think
that medical marijuana is grown in some
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy laboratory and it's done in some
magical mythical way but honestly medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and recreational marijuana in
colorado are grown in very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities i can speak from experience i
am the lead cultivator for three rivers i
[SPEAKER_00]: run their medical marijuana facility and i
run their recreational marijuana facility
[SPEAKER_00]: they are two different buildings but they
are simply across the parking lot from
[SPEAKER_00]: each other okay it's building right here
building right here i run from one
[SPEAKER_00]: building to the other all day taking care
of two different grows now they are the
[SPEAKER_00]: same strains of plants but they are not
the same plants the plants in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannot enter the recreational grow
the plants at the recreational grow cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: enter the medical grow they are to be kept
separate at all times it is two different
[SPEAKER_00]: business licenses with two different names
two different entities just owned by the
[SPEAKER_00]: same people so i bounce back and forth and
run both of them now now as for the
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities the buildings are constructed
and designed fairly similarly we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: long uh tables from midwest is it midwest
hydro or midwest greenhouse supply some
[SPEAKER_00]: company like that makes long rolling
tables we've got those tables in both
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities we've got double ended gavita
lights in both facilities we've got giant
[SPEAKER_00]: h vac in both facilities we've got the
auto water system in both facilities both
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities are fed the exact same mix we
don't buy this brand of nutrients for this
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and this brand of nutrients for
this facility we buy a whole shit ton and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in the warehouse and then divide it
up amongst each grow as needed so it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same tables the same lights it's the same
nutrients it's the same master grower it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the same grotex it's the same trimmers it
is the same trellis technique it is mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same genetics so when a grow is
started in colorado depending on how it
[SPEAKER_00]: started the plants have to come from
somewhere right if the license if the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational license is spawned from an
existing medical marijuana license there
[SPEAKER_00]: is an opportunity for a one-time plant
transfer so that means if i own a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana facility and i would like to
convert my medical marijuana to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana site of my store
which means everybody can shop there not
[SPEAKER_00]: just colorado medical patients i would be
allowed to do a one-time transfer to my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow which means i would be allowed to
take a clone of everything or 50 clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in the grow so i could go down
my genetic list i could get a rise i could
[SPEAKER_00]: get blueberry headband i could get
platinum tangy go get a clone of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they have to go in the computer
properly and they have to be manifested
[SPEAKER_00]: and transferred through the computer
system and then legally transferred from
[SPEAKER_00]: one grow to the other once they're at the
other grow they have to be received in a
[SPEAKER_00]: computer system and unloaded and tagged
properly so you're allowed to do that one
[SPEAKER_00]: time when a new facility opens so it's the
same genetics we're taking the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: from the medical marijuana facility and
manifesting them over to the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: facility it's the same plants now we're
growing we'll just say platinum tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll say sour tangy because we don't have
platinum tangy at the retro we'll say sour
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy we've got sour tangy at the medical
marijuana grow hypothetically if we were
[SPEAKER_00]: to open another recreational grow that
spawned off of our medical license we
[SPEAKER_00]: could just cut clones of that sour tangy
put them in the computer make a manifest
[SPEAKER_00]: for transfer transfer them receive that
transfer and now we've legally got that
[SPEAKER_00]: sour tangy clone in the garden at our new
recreational facility now that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what happened with three rivers or
anything but i mean that's hypothetically
[SPEAKER_00]: how it works that's how the clones are
spread from one facility to another there
[SPEAKER_00]: are other options to do it um we can sell
clones if three rivers either the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: or the recreational grow wanted to sell a
clone we could set up a business deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: another facility we could sell them trays
of clones they could take 50 to 500 clones
[SPEAKER_00]: of whatever they wanted of our genetics we
could pass it right along to them if that
[SPEAKER_00]: was something we do we don't really sell
clones but that's where the genetics come
[SPEAKER_00]: from you guys the medical marijuana clones
and the recreational marijuana clones are
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plants they just have different
colored tags the medical marijuana the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana enforcement division the
colorado department of public health and
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and the colorado department of
agriculture have all agreed on a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: set of pesticides we are and are not
allowed to use those are the same for both
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities so i don't have to make
pesticide plans of attack for different
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities i could just use my same idea
over here as i use over there so i guess
[SPEAKER_00]: the short answer to that question of
what's the difference between the way
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and recreational marijuana are
grown in colorado the main difference is
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes that's the only difference they are
taxed differently recreational marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: is taxed much higher than medical
marijuana other than the taxes it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same plants it's the same nutrients the
same lights the same tables the same
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides it's all the same stuff i don't
do anything differently in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: grow than i do in the recreational grow i
don't go over to one grow and say oh this
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to this store let's do it
differently i treat all of them the same i
[SPEAKER_00]: love each plant the same i make them all
the best i can i trellis them down i pop
[SPEAKER_00]: and crack the sticks i defoliate them i
treat them all the same so the only
[SPEAKER_00]: difference really is the taxes now with
that being said every store is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a different level of quality every
grow is going to have a different standard
[SPEAKER_00]: every trim company every trim crew is
going to have a different standard and a
[SPEAKER_00]: level of quality of trimming so keep that
in mind if you go to one store and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: got hairy buds that are untrimmed and
super dry check another store because they
[SPEAKER_00]: may have perfectly dried and cured buds
that are beautifully trimmed don't judge
[SPEAKER_00]: all of colorado by one or two dispensaries
please shop around when you come here but
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're coming from out of state please
don't feel like you're getting slighted
[SPEAKER_00]: please don't feel like you're getting
skipped on the quality products just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not buying a medical
marijuana product you're getting the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact quality as you would get if you were
a colorado medical marijuana patient the
[SPEAKER_00]: next thing i want to talk about was
inspired by my friend mama bear dabs on
[SPEAKER_00]: instagram a young lady asked mama bear
dabs how to get into the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and lucy had great answers she said first
of all find out if you can get a badge get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself a badge then come to colorado and
apply for jobs just like you would any
[SPEAKER_00]: other business she also said to have a
good resume i thought it would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea to mention some of the things that
you may include on your resume to get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself into the cannabis industry or if
you're in the cannabis industry there are
[SPEAKER_00]: things you can do to improve your resume
to hopefully improve your pay and your
[SPEAKER_00]: status in the cannabis industry so let's
get right to it here are some things you
[SPEAKER_00]: can think about if you're making a resume
trying to get a job in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry now the first thing you should
think about is you're trying to get a job
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you're trying to get other any
other job you need to be professional make
[SPEAKER_00]: a professional looking resume run spell
check a couple of times now if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: good at making a resume there are plenty
of websites that will have templates for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to go and kind of get a good guideline
on how to make a resume follow that
[SPEAKER_00]: template follow that guideline and make a
standard resume put in your information
[SPEAKER_00]: put in your skills put in your education
now this is where we are going to dial it
[SPEAKER_00]: in and make it put in all of the stuff
that you have done so that we know who we
[SPEAKER_00]: are dealing with if you're trying to be a
trimmer tell me how long you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming tell me your experience tell me
what equipment you have used if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be a trimmer have you used the
trim reaper have you used the tornado have
[SPEAKER_00]: you used the twister what have you used as
a trimmer are you just a scissor guy do
[SPEAKER_00]: you trim fast with your fingers also mark
down any trainings or certifications
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got I would always recommend
getting a key badge if you're going for a
[SPEAKER_00]: badge and you can afford it get a key
badge there's no reason not to get the key
[SPEAKER_00]: badge a support badge is great that gets
you in the door but that's all that does I
[SPEAKER_00]: need a key badge on premises at all times
if I am in the commercial grow and I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to the recreational grow I've got to
make sure there's a key badge there
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping an eye on everybody because I
can't leave a bunch of support badges in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room without a key badge on site it is
simply illegal if you have worker
[SPEAKER_00]: protection safety training document that
if you haven't had worker protection
[SPEAKER_00]: safety training I would learn how to get
worker protection safety training in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Colorado so that you can put that
on your resume also if you are a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applicator or you've had Department of
Agriculture pesticide training list that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have respirator training or
respirator certifications maybe you were a
[SPEAKER_00]: fireman in the past maybe you worked with
paints or something if you know how to use
[SPEAKER_00]: wear clean and safely remove a respirator
and you've got a little card from the the
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor that does respirator training
you've already got a reason to be hired
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's one less thing I have to
pay to have you trained and certified on
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got HVAC training you are golden
if you've gone to any HVAC school put that
[SPEAKER_00]: on your resume if you were an electrician
and it not just if you're some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: journeyman if you've got paper if you've
got some sort of card that says I have
[SPEAKER_00]: HVAC training or I have electrical
training put that down because we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that sort of stuff we've got seven
flower rooms and that means there are
[SPEAKER_00]: seven air conditioners which means there
are probably ten air conditioners because
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got veg rooms and a couple other
things now if you're a grow tech you're
[SPEAKER_00]: worth a little bit of money to us you can
make some good money hourly but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: a grow tech and you're an HVAC tech and my
air conditioner goes down and I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to call somebody from another service I
can say hey bro the HVAC and room C just
[SPEAKER_00]: went down I'll take over watering for you
can you run outside and see what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on with the HVAC and then I don't have to
have the outside service come who charges
[SPEAKER_00]: by the visit and they charge a whole lot
of money just to come look if they show up
[SPEAKER_00]: and get out of the truck it costs money a
lot of money and we would be able to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: an employee a dollar or two extra per hour
to have you as part of the staff and have
[SPEAKER_00]: you on site so when that HVAC does go
wrong you're already there I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have to call anybody you just walk out
there you fix it put that on the resume so
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got that ability you're
already moving up toward the top also
[SPEAKER_00]: right down here each machine that you know
how to use if you can use the wood chipper
[SPEAKER_00]: write down that you're good with the wood
chipper anything that you can use the the
[SPEAKER_00]: trim Reaper anything like that document
that because we need people that can run
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment the less I have to teach you the
better the more hireable you are the more
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make money right off the bat
coming into a facility write down anything
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got experience with like I am good
with the Gavita master controller I can
[SPEAKER_00]: program your Gavita lights I know a bunch
of tricks and things inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: controller that people may have overlooked
I've got a lot of experience with it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another thing that is on my resume
I am very familiar with the link for
[SPEAKER_00]: systems I have set up link for systems in
multiple facilities I have done
[SPEAKER_00]: troubleshooting with link for systems I
have been on tech support with link for
[SPEAKER_00]: before I've got a relationship with link
for I know how to use their products those
[SPEAKER_00]: are really difficult machines if you're
new with them I don't need to be trained
[SPEAKER_00]: on that I'm already worth a little bit
more money maybe you've been trained in
[SPEAKER_00]: bio track if you know how to use bio track
that's that's three weeks of training we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to give you bio track is a
little bitch it takes a lot of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn that if you already know how to do
that we're saving a lot of time metric
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in the Colorado marijuana
regulated business goes through a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: called metric if you have been trained or
are familiar with not the metric system
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cool too but metric is a computer
system if you've been trained or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with that put that down put how
long you have been playing with metric and
[SPEAKER_00]: put your abilities in metric what you know
and if you've done it a lot you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to put down to impress us write
that stuff down in your resume and that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you more valuable if I don't have to
train you in metric you're already more
[SPEAKER_00]: hireable you're already worth more money
there's less training to be done you're
[SPEAKER_00]: already more valuable employee another
thing I recommend that you can put on your
[SPEAKER_00]: resume is attend all of the metric classes
if you go to metrc.com is all I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's metric.com they are a multi-state
service so if you have regulated cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in your state there is probably a metric
program they will offer classes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the times you have to have your marijuana
enforcement division badge to log into
[SPEAKER_00]: there I'm not sure how each state is once
you get your badge you can log in and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can start taking metric classes you may be
able to take bud tending classes or
[SPEAKER_00]: grotech classes locally or online without
having a badge take those classes document
[SPEAKER_00]: them write them down add them to your
resume the more you know the less I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to train you the more valuable you are if
you can walk into the grove and start
[SPEAKER_00]: working today without shadowing me for
four or five days without having to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian around and learn all of Brian's
tricks if you can just come in and work
[SPEAKER_00]: you are more valuable you are saving us a
lot of time so write down all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff on your resume make sure we know who
and what we're dealing with before we hire
[SPEAKER_00]: you now another thing if you're applying
to be a trimmer this is really important
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are applying to be a trimmer in my
facility I am going to ask you in the very
[SPEAKER_00]: first interview how much can you trim a
day we dry trim if there is a guy taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: giant plant and bucking the buds off the
sticks and handing you a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket of nothing but buds to be trimmed
you don't have to do any of the work of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it off the stick the big leaves
are gone you just trim your little ass off
[SPEAKER_00]: how much can you trim today in eight hours
we're gonna go from eight to five at eight
[SPEAKER_00]: o 'clock we're gonna start trimming your
little scissors are gonna get going and I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see fire come out of them at 10 o
'clock I'm gonna yell stop trimming let's
[SPEAKER_00]: go smoke some dabs we're gonna go take a
break we're gonna come back at 10 15 I
[SPEAKER_00]: want you trimming from 10 15 to 12 at 12
we're taking an hour lunch do whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want for that hour I'll see you at 1 o
'clock from 1 until 3 scissors are on fire
[SPEAKER_00]: again from 3 15 to 5 scissors on fire
what's going on how much can you trim a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people look me in the face and tell
me I could probably do three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds I had one guy telling me I could
guarantee you three pounds every day dog I
[SPEAKER_00]: hired him guess what a motherfucker pulled
out like a half a pound five days in a row
[SPEAKER_00]: guess where he works now not at three
rivers I don't know where he works he lied
[SPEAKER_00]: to me he told me he could do more than he
could do I believed him I hired him he
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking failed he got fired he was a good
dude he was a good worker if you would
[SPEAKER_00]: have said bro I could probably crank out a
half a pound a day and he would have came
[SPEAKER_00]: into the facility and cranked out a half a
pound a day guess what he would have met
[SPEAKER_00]: his quota he would have met his standards
he would not have been a bullshitter and
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd still have a job so don't lie if you
can only trim a half a pound a day tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: currently I only can do a half a pound a
day we'll find you tips and tricks we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get you to a pound and a half a day you
just gotta not lie to me if you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: karate class and you say I'm a black belt
and I find out you're a purple belt I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna kick your ass because you lied to me
if you come into my grow and you say I can
[SPEAKER_00]: trim half a pound a day I'm gonna teach
you how to be a fucking black belt and
[SPEAKER_00]: trim a pound and a half if you come in and
say I can trim two pounds I expect two
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds from you every day that's a goal
you set that was your goal that you that
[SPEAKER_00]: was your expectation why'd you lie to me
you could have said a quarter pound and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you could have said I could probably
do a quarter pound and you would have came
[SPEAKER_00]: in and trimmed half a pound I would have
thought you were a fucking rock star so
[SPEAKER_00]: don't lie to anybody on your resume don't
lie to get the job because we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: find out if you say I know how to do all
this stuff we're gonna take you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and we're gonna say do all this stuff
and you're gonna be mixing nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say what's the pH and you're
gonna go how do I check the pH we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you lied so don't lie don't over
promise always under promise over deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something I could definitely say
would be a good idea on your resume but
[SPEAKER_00]: don't set expectations that you're not
going to meet because that is the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to get fired way quickly in a grow
facility all right so let's review really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and then we're gonna start
wrapping this podcast up list all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: skills list any equipment you've been
trained on and list all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: certifications I would highly recommend
getting a key badge if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work in the grow I would recommend either
worker protection safety training before
[SPEAKER_00]: you're even hired or a pesticide
applicator license through the Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Ag it's one test it's affordable and
you can do it also if you're gonna do that
[SPEAKER_00]: get respirator certified if you're going
to apply pesticides in Colorado in a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical or recreational grow you're
required to wear a respirator anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing that respirator needs a respirator
certification it's really easy it costs a
[SPEAKER_00]: few bucks you go to a doctor you take the
respirator that you plan on using you wear
[SPEAKER_00]: that respirator they make sure that you
can put it's a fit test is what it is they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make sure you can put it on right
they want to make sure you take it off
[SPEAKER_00]: safely because when you take it off you
got your gloves on you've got this dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator with pesticides on it they want
to make sure you're gonna take it off in a
[SPEAKER_00]: manner that you're not going to spread the
pesticides to your eyes or skin so be
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator certified if you've got any
HVAC or electrical training mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can use any specialized devices
could be to control or smart bees link
[SPEAKER_00]: fours mention that if you're good with any
computer programs biotrac or metric
[SPEAKER_00]: mention that if you've gone to any classes
please mention that if you've gone to
[SPEAKER_00]: cloverleaf if you've gone to oakster dam
if you've been to any of the budtender
[SPEAKER_00]: trainings mention all of that honestly we
don't care about your pictures we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see any of your buds you're gonna
prove that part when you work in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: we've already got a master grower that's
gonna do that for you so just write down
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can do write down who you are we
can grow already we want to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to do we don't want to see
your pictures we don't want to know about
[SPEAKER_00]: your Instagram just come in with a solid
resume be on time just because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed industry doesn't mean you can be 15
minutes late don't come in super high I
[SPEAKER_00]: get it you're applying for a job in the
weed industry don't come in so high that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't look me in the face don't come
in just reeking you are applying for a job
[SPEAKER_00]: be professional and also act like you've
been here before act like this is not your
[SPEAKER_00]: first time at a grow if I feel like the
interview is going well I will offer you a
[SPEAKER_00]: tour of the grow I'm kind of checking you
out at that time I'm taking your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature seeing if you can handle being
around that many plants seeing if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna freak out seeing how big your eyes
are gonna get seeing if you start reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: into your pockets thinking about how to
steal some shit I'm kind of feeling you
[SPEAKER_00]: out when I take you back to the grow to
give you a tour so keep yourself in check
[SPEAKER_00]: act like you've been there before and
don't let things get to your head all
[SPEAKER_00]: right that's my advice for a resume and
also kind of I guess for an interview when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to get a job in the cannabis
industry hey I need to give a couple of
