[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, what's up ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for episode number 41 of the
[SPEAKER_02]: iGrow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining me for another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me on mic tonight, our good buddy
Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: And our good buddy Adam is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam hasn't been here for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tired?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick and tired?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's about time you're doing some
work bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a little mini vacation for a
minute there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was longer than a mini one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to the working community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's turn that music down a little bit
and get a podcast going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was supposed to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not blaming anything on Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse was trying to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't make it tonight, unfortunately,
so had to kind of replan the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we blame it on Jesse?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Jesse's fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse could make it so we're not going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Jesse has been trying to get an
electrician to his new grow facility and
[SPEAKER_02]: that dude's been putting him off and
tonight he showed up and he called me and
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like dude do that because I know how
hard it is to get an electrician to your
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and once he's there you're paying
him and it's hard to get him there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep him there and get the work
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jesse had to take a rain check.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he can come over later or tomorrow,
I'll put out another show in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: the week with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse was kind enough to host another
party at Hygro last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to, before I even forget,
before I have a chance to forget,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to give a huge shout out to NanoLux
Lighting and Hygro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_02]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone just looked over across the room
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty new toy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dual ended bulb and a ballast and
reflector all attached into one piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the new NanoLux 1000 watt that
actually has a 1200 watt setting on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be cranking 1200 watts in
one section and we're going to see what
[SPEAKER_02]: that light does.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave it to me to run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said run a couple cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know what you think and we'll talk
about the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that works out, NanoLux may be a
podcast sponsor in the future here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really, really cool new toy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see what she does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fancy looking light for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the dual ended bulbs and it's
the kind that's got the ballast and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: got a short reflector and I kind of like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got it all in one piece and it all
hangs from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only the, is it 240 or 220?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only the 240 plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always get that one confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm not good with remembering that
many goddamn numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They mess with my brain, but I have a good
feeling about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave it to me because they know I'm
going to kick ass with it and see what it
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I probably should have asked before
I touched, but that's one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: things I did when I walked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Adam walked in and just opened the
box, looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched it and didn't get too much of a
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to see if it was still in
the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to break anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do, you get to buy me a new light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else are we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all sat around today, like a bunch of
bros and took dabs and watched a movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually going to watch a video on
the show together because some of us have
[SPEAKER_02]: seen it, some haven't, and I want to watch
it and actually I haven't seen it to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you the truth and I know I need to watch
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to watch it live on the podcast so
that I can give you my reaction live on
[SPEAKER_02]: the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get that far, we have to do
this stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is brought to you by our good
friends at Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using high quality concentrates,
you deserve a high quality titanium nail
[SPEAKER_02]: made in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trust a Chinese nail or an American
knockoff made of cheap metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust the industry leader.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust the innovator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust the king.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big, huge shout out to Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Task is making these new dabbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's learned this new coloring method so
that he can color this titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them look really sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been seeing them from time to time
when I'm scrolling through YouTube,
[SPEAKER_03]: or not YouTube, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram?
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to push that mic a little closer
to your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little closer to the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got that tone that it gets lost
in the mics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tone is hard to record.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes me a minute to get comfortable at
the beginning of every show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I was going to talk about this in a
minute so I'm going to finish this ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out HighlyEducatedTI.com for more

[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to buy some highly educated
products, go to AqualabTechnology.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's search for highly educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a bunch of great stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge shout out while I'm thinking about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse last night, dude at the Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies grower meeting,
[SPEAKER_02]: gave a class lecture on taking clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice little clone lesson, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude killed it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually did a hell of a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to cut this music out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's next on the playlist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to give a big shout out to the
Mystic Roots band and Koop Dogg and Stay
[SPEAKER_02]: Positive Sound, Stay Positive Productions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have given me full permission to play
all of the Mystic Roots library on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The track you just heard was DJing a
dance, the instrumental version.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind enough to send me every
track they've done, instrumental.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've got a lot of fresh music for
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Jesse, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a hell of a good job hosting that
party last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk more about that in a
minute, but I want to get that shout out
[SPEAKER_02]: before I forget because for some reason I
get forgetful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a dab here in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was talking about a pre-show dab
and I wanted to get that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adds out of the way and get those done
right before I got super dabbed out and
[SPEAKER_02]: start coughing again.

[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any comments to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guess what that means, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to take a quick dab and then
we're going to come back and we are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to review a couple of videos that we
watched and we'll actually watch a video
[SPEAKER_02]: on the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, stick around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody at the table got super chatty as
soon as I decided to turn off the mics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm turning the mics back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, we were sitting there
waiting for you to pay the bills and pay
[SPEAKER_01]: the dues and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that shit's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab on the show since
the mics came back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give a big shout out while I
heat up the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody remind me the name of this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott, I feel like an asshole because I
forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sucker looks brand new, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell it's a repair.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hits brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it in a timely manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: The price was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the little chick that works there is
super sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's super friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go back there when I need a repair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I don't ever need a damn repair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you guys talk about something
chaotic?
[SPEAKER_01]: We went there and he was looking for a
rig, but they had tons of little tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: miniature cakes like his Phase 2 over
there that was maybe this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a smaller shake for only,
there weren't bad prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two or three inches off the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not three inches, maybe two and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: But compared to what we have here locally
in town, it had more selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just had shit crammed in cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: They barely had room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was definitely selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely a cool place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Met a friendly dude in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was talkative.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some Golden Goat hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't really have anything to do with
the store though, so don't go expecting
[SPEAKER_02]: some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if he had anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just hanging out in there throwing
people his hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just a customer trying to be
social.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never known any place that can fix a
broken piece before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You break a piece, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say goodbye, bury that sucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks brand new people, so you might
be able to save it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I got a hookup or anything
because I've been in there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the price they charged me,
I was blown away at how cheap it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I'm concerned, it's a miracle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know this was a thing before.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made me drop a deposit on it,
which was cheap, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pay the deposit to have it repaired.
[SPEAKER_02]: They repair it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they break it when it's getting
repaired, you get 30% off the rig of your
[SPEAKER_02]: choice in the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: My voice will come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sound weird because I just took a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all choked up trying to get this dab
going for Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wider here, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's thinner right there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it tapered a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tapered just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like they cut it off right at the
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I broke it right where the new
joint, the line is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old one broke right there anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just cleaned it up and put a new one
on nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dab for Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's going to cough forever after this,
so you guys be prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good hash with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Turpex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpex?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you guys killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gatsby, I shouted you guys out last week
and you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dabbing some super lemon haze right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it hits the back of your throat,
it's definitely lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's my stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had this set aside for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some of the sour grapes and it was
some of the better shatter that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: tasted here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to those guys up there and
Springs rocking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan and Jordan.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why you don't smoke tobacco,
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear Mike over there trying to die?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like he needs oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs scuba gear just to do a podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for you who is iron lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sometimes dude, at the end of the
day, it hurts and I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I have to wait till seven,
10 in the evening to take a good dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you cough a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not every time, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The graham dab did not make me cough
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you hit that thing for two and a half
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing what I do, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you dab much at all or with people at
all, you see quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you smoke tobacco, you dab and then you
sound like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just consume cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You dab and sound like Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sound like this on the radio.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sound like you should be our radio
host.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a face for radio, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bring this meeting to order.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked a little bit about the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was kind enough to show up to the
grow meeting hosted by high grow indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: growing supplies last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a text.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I ate too much and I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Move.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're supposed to bring me food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder if that means that I'm not
getting food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more mingle than, uh, than lesson
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I liked that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the lesson was, I think I realized
about halfway through that most of us were
[SPEAKER_02]: probably able to do everything that Jesse
was teaching, but I'm glad he took that as
[SPEAKER_02]: his first teaching opportunity because
he's good now, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's learning and he's catching up being
on this podcast has really made him a
[SPEAKER_02]: better speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now he's able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the next couple of lessons,
Jesse's going to really crush it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked a bad spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my, if I tried to watch Jesse while
he was talking, I would have been watching
[SPEAKER_03]: his back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was watching everyone else watch
Jesse and he, I mean, cloning isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: complicated, but he went over all the
steps real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at one point everybody in the room
pretty much went, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And took a second to pull their phone out
or grab a pen and jot down a little note.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I should use this product or I'm
keeping it too wet or too dry or over or
[SPEAKER_03]: under watering or, I mean, just little
simple stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely the little talk
afterward, the fine tuning talk about,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're probably over watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what you're doing, you're
probably under watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what was really valuable after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But dude, Jesse did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super proud of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you listen to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I'm all choked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, huge shout out to burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, uh, let's just throw a party back
there in the back of the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, it's kind of her store.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's her baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for letting us make a mess in
your place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got like 12 dudes hanging out back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for the invite to,
uh, to the social gathering there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a good time there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, high grow indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do that every month and we'll
announce the dates on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to get as many people as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Armando, bro, I looked forward to you
being there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry you couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we can have another one in
December.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: December is kind of rough for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of holidays there for all
the different religious groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have, they are talking about
doing a December event.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, uh, they brought it up at least
twice last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't remember what the date was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they've have one nailed down
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little space, a big space heater.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we decide to do it back there in
December, cause it was a little chilly,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes chilly is what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if a room is that vapor filled,
we'll go with, um, it was a private part.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to open the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Private party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's invite only.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, what about you were saying the
larger area towards the outside of town
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe you would be able to got at one
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're that's, that's in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're definitely looking at another
social club.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a private party thing that will
be an invite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just thinking for that since
it was no heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far we like doing it at the store
because then I talk about a product and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can run down the hallway and grab it and
be like, this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bunch of people left with stuff,
which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told this story once, but I'm sitting
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The night's pretty much over.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bunch of people left with products
that they bought after the grow lesson is
[SPEAKER_03]: what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were a bunch of people that left
with stuff like you left with stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give out gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely give out prizes and shit
for people coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start doing contests and
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we're just, we're just getting it
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't our forte.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just decided that it needed to be Jesse
decide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking credit for nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Jesse did all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he decided that this needed to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's learning when I'm helping them
learn, you know, they've got a hell of a
[SPEAKER_01]: little shop down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't you say that you two kind of
inspire each other?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, we completely inspire each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've been talking about it on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse is now kind of officially a part of
iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's breeding seeds that will be
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I think our plan goes,
there'll be in iry genetics packaging and
[SPEAKER_02]: on the iry genetics website, we're just
going to add them to here and I'll give
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse is now breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not all me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those strains that they'll be specific
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sitting there at the, uh,
the hydro meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm chilling, talking to people just like
we do bullshit and I'm nice and dabbed out
[SPEAKER_02]: and Jesse comes up and he slides a nanolux
thousand watt light, a full kit right in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes here, man, run this and let me
know what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, shocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is the only word I can come up
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Christmas doesn't just appear in front of
you like on a Friday in November and it
[SPEAKER_03]: did last night for you and it was fun to
watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm not used to getting a big,
that's a big ass gift to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice, yeah, that was huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see it coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I saw Jesse give it to you,
I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looked at this way though,
in three months, when you come back to
[SPEAKER_01]: them, like, do you do like a trading
credit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I take, can you take these five and
can I get four more of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like that'll speak volumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll definitely shout that it's nanolux
is the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, nanolux and hydro indoor growing
supplies get mad respect from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out my, on Instagram, I post a lot
of stuff as I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that light really honestly won't get
hung until December.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a crop that's growing in the room
where that will go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that crop finishes, that light
will go up and then we'll start under
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it kicks as much ass as it appears,
if it, you know, as it looks, you'll be in
[SPEAKER_03]: the shop buying three more of them here
come March.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll buy four or five more.
[SPEAKER_02]: My only concern is venting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those don't match up with my venting
style.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can only run those in the winter,
but I can, you know, if they kick as much
[SPEAKER_02]: ass as people have been saying,
I can readjust my rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I have to do is change air
conditioning, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just go change up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't you just shorten the pipes and
kind of ducked out from the main room from
[SPEAKER_01]: top and filter into the bottom,
you know, cool air in hot air out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the lights I'm running now are ducted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the heat from the lights I'm running
now doesn't ever make it to the room and
[SPEAKER_02]: those are not ducted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only, only downside that I'm
seeing right now, but it's all one unit,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I've never seen before the ballast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the light is all usually separate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is all one solid, really
well-built unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it looks like it's well-built.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much lighter than it looks also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's heavy as hell,
but it's really light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we're talking about this,
where did I set that?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is brought to you by Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that happened just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visit the Denver store at 62-71 Beach
Street, or check out the Pueblo location
[SPEAKER_02]: at 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_02]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hygro, I got to catch up with myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hygro is running a special for the podcast
listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you check out at Hygro, tell them you
listen to the Hygro Culture podcast and
[SPEAKER_02]: they will give you commercial pricing on
your entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a sweet deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about it the other night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a bag of dirt, that bag of dirt
that you see part of it on the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bag of dirt is a $25 bag of dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid about $17 and some jingles,
some change in there for that bag of dirt
[SPEAKER_02]: out the door because I paid commercial
pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hell of a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pay what the dispensaries pay is what
our pricing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use that code, if you tell them,
I listen to the Hygro Culture podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: pay the same prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude, it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for someone like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone low budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low budget, if you're listening,
hey, you could save yourself some money
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coupons, coupons, some coupons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of couponing, shout out to Matty.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up, Matty?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the coupon queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see you back in action,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You looked good last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I saw Spence last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence is back in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back on his feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude weighs 140 pounds now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's somewhere between 6'4 and 6'5
depending on who you ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never run into people taller than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of the few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's 140 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, so you guys send him some calories.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can mentally put calories on my
brother Spence, just send them right to
[SPEAKER_02]: him because he needs some help right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it because, you know, pressure is
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wish him luck and glad to see he's back
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you wishing him luck for the secret
cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're wishing him luck for?
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be what I'm wishing him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the secret cup is coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The finals.
[SPEAKER_02]: The finals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I expect that to be Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: About December 15th-ish because that's
around when he'll be back, I predict.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm just guessing, being
hypothetical here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second week of December,
maybe the beginning of the third week of
[SPEAKER_02]: December, you think right here in Mike's
chair, you think we'll have the secret cup
[SPEAKER_02]: winner, Garden of Whedon and his lovely
lady Maddie sitting right next to us right
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do, can I be in the chair that's
behind the dab stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just sit in the corner and be quiet
for that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chair with no mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a chair that sometimes
people sit in and there's no mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mic sits right here next to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could fire this mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a droopy stand from what I
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, but I've got a replacement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people don't want to be heard
and they just sit here and dish out dabs
[SPEAKER_02]: and just sit on the podcast and just
watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd look them in the eye when I
do the intro and stuff and I have someone
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you hear those lively ass intros,
they're all, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because there's someone here to
fire me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Adam's been here for a night.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the podcast world, when you're doing a
microphone and you got a voice going and
[SPEAKER_02]: you got the energy, sometimes you fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a night, one night when Adam and
I sat here for probably 45 minutes just
[SPEAKER_02]: going, so welcome to the fucking show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are failing miserably with a rhythm and
a conversation and a lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should probably fast forward
through the rest of this show because
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight is not our flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just skip episode 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how it felt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pulled it off eventually through the
magic of editing and a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw some more shatter at the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to talk about where it
went.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just went, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imaginary characters walked into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us might've been hearing voices.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been, this is going to be,
guys, this is going to be one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes where we just kind of rattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tweeted us and we'll send you free
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Mike said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tweet at Mike and he will send you free
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be good free shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a big pen, but it'll be some
free shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a pen I chewed on at city council
one night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something we can go into.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard about any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the city council guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since Adam wants to just run right into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that every now and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my note's for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much time do you think you can wrap
that up in quite quickly and not bore the
[SPEAKER_02]: shit out of you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I condense everything you need to know
into just a little paragraph or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, this may be local news for most of
what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is happening in my town and in my
county.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very pertinent to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a home-grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow my personal medicine here in my
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do some small stuff in my home because
that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everything has to happen in a large
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am Mike's medical marijuana provider and
his caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's happening pertains to Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a very real way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to enforce rules upon me
and my grow that will... It's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck with Mike's medicine supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to find a classier way to
say that, but it's going to hinder my
[SPEAKER_02]: production of Mike's quality medicine and
Mike relies on me for medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike is going to city council.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep cutting you off, but I'm setting
you up good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is going to city council to make sure
this doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is super important to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit could happen in your area and
someone's got to stand up and do what Mike
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're doing that, I give you a huge
shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn it over to Mike for a
couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what you learned at city council
recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So down here in Pueblo, Colorado,
they're looking at passing home-grow rules
[SPEAKER_03]: in the city and in the county.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two very separate efforts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to go to two very separate
meetings to be involved with this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, the planning and zoning
department with the city has finalized
[SPEAKER_03]: their proposal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sending that recommendation onto
city council.
[SPEAKER_03]: City council will receive it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I expect that to happen at their first
meeting in December.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's December 8th.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then their final meeting in December
on December 22nd, they'll likely be taking
[SPEAKER_03]: public comment and a vote on these
proposed home-grow rules that will
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially limit every caregiver in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really, really ugly rules,
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to get down to city council on
the 22nd and speak out against these rules
[SPEAKER_03]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also out in the county.
[SPEAKER_03]: That meeting is going to be taking place
on December 10th at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that meeting's a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark your calendars.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can get down there, check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in local Pueblo
cannabis law news, check out Pueblo for
[SPEAKER_03]: sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to post this stuff up as fast
as I can, but getting digital copies of
[SPEAKER_03]: the ordinances that I can easily post to
Facebook has been a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: But info about the meetings and what you
can do to help out, that's the best place
[SPEAKER_03]: to look right now if you're looking for
that kind of info.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's essentially it, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just mainly on caregivers?
[SPEAKER_03]: The city and the county rules are
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an extension of what you already
went to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely go for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you need support on, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules as they stand right now,
there's a whole lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't make a whole lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a whole bunch of private
lobbying trying to stop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me an example of a couple of
the stupid rules they're trying to put
[SPEAKER_02]: out?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're banning all CO2 usage in any sort
of marijuana grow room, but the way they
[SPEAKER_03]: write that rule I mean, it's dumb just on
its face.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way it's written would make it
illegal to take the soda stream machine I
[SPEAKER_03]: have in my kitchen into a grow room and
use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a special new crime now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you grabbed that one right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a rule that I find ridiculous
because there are people at CO2 where he's
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about CO2 for CO2 augmentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run CO2 in grow rooms because the CO2
plants would thrive with more CO2 than
[SPEAKER_02]: what's naturally available in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your natural grow, you probably have
about three to 500, probably right around
[SPEAKER_02]: 400 particles per million of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the hydro shop, they'll set
you up with a system where you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: about, it would be cool if you could get
about 1200 to 1800 PPMs of CO2 in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that does is your plants breathe that
and they grow much more vigorously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get bigger buds, you get denser buds,
you get larger plants and it makes them
[SPEAKER_02]: grow more quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tomato growers use this.
[SPEAKER_03]: All kinds of indoor plant growers use CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these rules are written so that
they could easily be applied to anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: doing the same thing with something that's
not cannabis, but it's all cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully the city council will see how
much nonsense this is and kill it and send
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole matter back to planning and
zoning for a redo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's done that they pick out
CO2 because the tomato farmer can go to
[SPEAKER_02]: the hydro shop and buy it and take it to
his house and run it in the basement just
[SPEAKER_02]: like Adam would in his basement grow,
just like Mike would in his basement grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the rules is someone,
they heard something that sounded scary
[SPEAKER_03]: and so they wrote a rule that says you
can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because they don't know what they're
talking about and the research didn't get
[SPEAKER_03]: done, a lot of the rules don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've described it to other people is like
listening to a five-year-old lecture on
[SPEAKER_03]: calculus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter how much homework they
did the night before.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lecture will be total nonsense from
start to finish and anyone not throwing
[SPEAKER_03]: rocks is doing so out of being polite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just painful to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time we went, two of the council
at least seemed to be, I won't say
[SPEAKER_01]: pro-pot, but not against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say anyone on council is
pro-pot, but there are some that are
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in what legal marijuana can do
for the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's only two out of the five.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still the minority of the vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an uphill climb for sure,
which is why I keep bringing it up on this
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast because people need to show up to
these meetings and start pitching in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If planning and zoning's work on the
marijuana rules is indicative of their
[SPEAKER_03]: work on other rules, that might be an
explanation into why nothing works here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might just be that nobody's paid
attention to government for so long that
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't expect to get caught just doing
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people aren't aware that we can
just go to city council and sign up and
[SPEAKER_02]: sit at that little cozy chair with a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's cushy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's intimidating if you're not that kind
of person, but the first time you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I could go now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had some real business to go deal
with, I could go speak there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inviting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, Adam looks like a homeless
person with headphones on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's wearing an irie genetics hoodie that
could use a wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some dreadlocks that are the same
as the hoodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely could use a wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a tore up green t-shirt under
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see his pants, but his shoes are
definitely muddy as crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with holes in the bottom of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But dude, you're invited to go talk at
city council.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can speak and nobody will judge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll listen to what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may judge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw them definitely, condescendingly
judge one person for a few minutes and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was almost entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can go speak and you can say your
piece and you get, I think, five full
[SPEAKER_02]: solid minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: During public comment, they give anyone
who wants to come and sign up five full
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes to speak on anything they'd like
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this happens in every city.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a city hall that has city
council meetings, you can go and you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if it's something that one guy came
and talked for six minutes about the bike
[SPEAKER_02]: lane and how to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say it felt like he was
giving the city council a lesson on how to
[SPEAKER_02]: use bike lanes, but I think he was asking
for more funding to create more bike lanes
[SPEAKER_02]: was his goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Information on how to use bike lanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these meetings are broadcast free to
the public on like channel 16 or 17 here
[SPEAKER_03]: locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's trying to show the city how to
use these new bike lanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just, he found out a free way
to get on TV and give a little educational
[SPEAKER_03]: speed on bike lanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are against something that's
going, or if you need something that isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: happening to happen, if you're not getting
some good recycling in your city,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to city council and be like,
Hey, we've got a lot of trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should work on some recycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's your path, do whatever your
passion is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our passion is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to city council and we're
saying cannabis a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a young woman who comes down and
speaks on roadside memorials all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, half the room's in tears every
time she speaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you pro or are you for or against
roadside memorials?
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was a quick 30 seconds,
Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they trash or are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely wouldn't walk by and kick
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not that kind of an asshole,
but to me it's something that,
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, no one's been lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard for me to really yearn for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every culture has a way they mourn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because I don't understand it
doesn't mean they shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're everywhere down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, driving around and not
being used to roadside memorials because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not something you see all the time in
Denver, even though people have died on
[SPEAKER_03]: every street corner in Denver too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's probably dying on a street
corner in Denver while we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably several people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to shift some gears.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one more thing to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I got to say is that- Mike,
thanks for bringing news to the table,
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have some intelligent news coming
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my whole notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't look to me for more info.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got news too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't expect to vote for our president and
he's going to change cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your city council has to be cannabis,
pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you work from your city council
to your mayor and you try to get that dude
[SPEAKER_01]: in office.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way Colorado did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't start, it started in Denver and
they criminalized it and it worked
[SPEAKER_01]: outwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is just what I know from
looking outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: With anything political, you definitely
start local.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you generate your base and
your support.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they say grassroots political effort
is going door to door and saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey stranger, what do you think about
cannabis laws or whatever you're
[SPEAKER_03]: passionate about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's tons of that here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of people on a national
level, they think at Colorado and they
[SPEAKER_03]: think they've legalized medical marijuana
years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: They legalized recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: The game's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a very real sense, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in line on January 1st with Jeff and
other people and there was a dance people
[SPEAKER_03]: were doing on the way out of the store
that they just couldn't help.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one struts and dances and shimmies
through a parking lot on their way out of
[SPEAKER_03]: Safeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the shuffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was for a few brief days before we
got closed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike worked with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was Mike's boss at the only medical
marijuana center in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold medical cannabis over the counter
for months and I'm well known for that
[SPEAKER_02]: around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time or bliss is just something
so fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked out of that dispensary in January
1st after I was the first person to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational cannabis at the greener side
dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I walked out, I've said that so many
times, when I walked out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary, I was like, there was a camera
guy there and he goes, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing a documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us, can you say something
good when you walk out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, cool, watch this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went right back in the door and I
came back out and I've threw my arms up in
[SPEAKER_02]: the air and I yelled just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, my name is Rasta Jeff and I was the
first person to buy recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: at the greener side dispensary in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I screamed, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that guy looked to me like,
that was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was exactly what he needed for
his film.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be found somewhere on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Filmed stuff that they're going to use
every couple of weeks for the next hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: years that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just pulled up, you were talking,
reading news.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I was leading that is once
Colorado legalized marijuana, the fight
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly became cities and counties looking
for fun ways to ban it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, in a very real way we won,
but in a very real way, now we're making
[SPEAKER_03]: the rules and drafting the path forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the whole world's watching
Colorado and Pueblo reports our tax
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a very real way, our tiny little
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you say we get a lot of Texas
traffic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're like the first stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of every kind of traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo is on the way to the rest of the US
from every place south of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This used to be a stop on the Santa Fe
trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Major stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been stopping and getting
supplies or gas here for a lot longer than
[SPEAKER_03]: any of us have been alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to, let's do a, do you guys
feel how much time we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've only got a couple things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to see how long we've been into
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're 35 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read a news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read a news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's always bringing the good news,
but I just read news from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's kind of a neat article.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shows to me, this shows that things
are evolving and that America is starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to make changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I got from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a positive changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says marijuana activists are already
planning the 2016 campaign to regulate and
[SPEAKER_02]: legalize the sale for recreational pot in
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Home to Las Vegas, one of the world's
biggest tourism destinations, but some
[SPEAKER_02]: tourists won't have to wait that long to
legally buy weed in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to the most legal reciprocity law
in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: I nailed that word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We practiced this beforehand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tricky word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Words are hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to define it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't know how to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could read it like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, my tongue is mad at that word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reciprocity, homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mike just said it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to point at Mike and
he'll say that word every time it comes up
[SPEAKER_02]: from now on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana card holders throughout
the US will be able to purchase pot in
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevada starting in 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: All they'll have to do is show their
medical marijuana license, show a
[SPEAKER_02]: government ID proving they're 21 or older
and sign an affidavit and they'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: access to that shop, but no others for
their stay in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that lead me to believe they only get
one stop when they go to Nevada?
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like you got to pick it and
stick it, homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick one and stay with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how much are you allowed to...
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're trying to prevent smurfing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an odd way to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will this liberal medical reciprocity...
Reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering what the point was going
to look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came across the word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reciprocity act as a soft lead to
recreational measures in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And will Nevada pass full on recreational
legalization in 2016?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he must not be able to say the word
either because he skipped it in his
[SPEAKER_02]: sentence and they put it in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't say the word either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tricky one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not alone there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention if Missouri goes legal this
year, which they're talking about 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan, Alaska, California is going to
be trying to do legalization this year as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened, Florida?
[SPEAKER_01]: 58% is a pretty good number.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it sucks for those people that are
sick and they need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But did we or did we not talk about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't trust Florida's government to give
them say, oh, okay, here's a full medical
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing can come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing can go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be all CBD here in Florida
because we just got such bang in medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: like New Jersey does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were part of that kind of argument in
the beginning and I stuck with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Florida's having all kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had CBD only legislation before this
recent medical marijuana failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right after the medical marijuana
amendment failed, the judge tossed their
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're back to square fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this article says, giving patients the
ability to legally access medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana when they're visiting a legal
medical marijuana state just makes sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: said Taylor West, deputy director of the
National Cannabis Industry Association and
[SPEAKER_02]: National Trade Group for legal marijuana
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes even more sense when you're
talking about a state that has such a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: number of out of state visitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's safer for patients and good for
Nevada businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Win-win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would almost be like Florida,
you know, like if you went medical and
[SPEAKER_02]: would allow other states to come in,
that dispensary right by Disney World
[SPEAKER_02]: would crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's been the two downsides to
medical marijuana from the beginning is
[SPEAKER_03]: it's technically illegal and you can't
travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're good in Colorado,
you're not good anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're good in Washington, you're not
good anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there's some reciprocity and
that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see me in Vegas now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, now look at all the events,
you know, secret cups going to be way
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, five hundred tickets max.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it small, nice and private.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that sentiment, but I'd be
impressed if they keep it to five hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The article goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, sure enough, Vegas sees roughly
40 million visitors annually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how many of those tourists will have
valid medical marijuana cards and how many
[SPEAKER_02]: of those patients will take the time to
seek legal Nevada weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still talking relatively small
numbers, said Joe Hodas, chief marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: officer at Denver based marijuana company,
Eddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I read that way too quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dixie Elixirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as if the it's not as if the average
tourist or consumer can show up and make a
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Red Card Act won't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's what they're calling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't have a huge impact on their
tourism because it's a small number of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, many of whom were probably already
going to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a convenience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I have a red card, I can already
get my medicine in my own state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But flying with it could be sketchy
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can get it in your own state.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't take it with you to Vegas
because you've got to fly there or drive
[SPEAKER_03]: through Utah or New Mexico to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now it sounds like you're legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get there, you can have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what happens when it becomes under
pressure, it like explodes or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the TSA telling us no.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody else can change their
policies except for the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: transport everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says if Nevada does pass
recreational marijuana measures in 2016,
[SPEAKER_02]: the election in the 2016 election,
the earliest the state will see those
[SPEAKER_02]: sales starting as late 2017, but 2018 is
more likely until then companies such as
[SPEAKER_02]: Dixie, which hopes to soon have an
agreement allowing the state the sale of
[SPEAKER_02]: its cannabis infused edibles, drinks and
topicals in Nevada will have time to leave
[SPEAKER_02]: their mark on the Las Vegas strip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask why two years,
but after seeing what just happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington where they're so well prepared
for recreational, I would almost expect
[SPEAKER_01]: two years to be right about right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them time to grow some bird,
get the rules in place, build a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary, get a couple of things in
stock and like cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a funny joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think the dispensary is going to cure
some weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a funny guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Har har har.
[SPEAKER_02]: Derka derka.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Derka derka.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't review either the film we
watched.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we're headed right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the next thing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys, we bragged about Adam and I
bragged recently about a couple of months
[SPEAKER_02]: ago about going to see Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't shut up about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I've seen the special,
I can see why you didn't shut up about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we saw Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angela, myself and Adam went and saw Joe
Rogan live at the Denver Comedy Works
[SPEAKER_02]: during the taping of his new special that
aired last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I DVR'd it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike came over here and watched it with
Angela and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam watched it at his place with his kind
lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a funny, damn comedy special.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cut out a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cut out a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you guys were saying last
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the final product they put
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had that quality of a video
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cameras were tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The camera that Rogan is staring into the
majority of the time, I'm sitting under a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small little thing like a LED
screen display, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crushed it from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was laughing hard last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first professional one, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a good one to go to,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hadn't gone to another show at Comedy
Works before that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been to a professional comedy
show like somebody TV-wise, big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done stuff here and it's basically
the same, but there was a lot more rules
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a comedy special.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taping was intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were so many crowd rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were moving the crowd around and
putting ugly people in the back and sexy
[SPEAKER_02]: people up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we were under camera so you
couldn't even see us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sort of pointless.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never saw a real good look at anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was headed with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only lights in the building were on
the stage and you couldn't even see the
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the moving around and all the rules
and the no hats and no logo shit was just
[SPEAKER_02]: too much tension.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have applied if he had a
20-minute bid on picking on people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: front row or some shit, but all I saw was
the profile of one kid a couple of times
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's pretty much all the crowd you
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we were for Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I kept telling him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are three seats off to the side up
on the top and that's where... Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see right next to Jeff,
Jeff was basically underneath the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a guy sitting next to us,
but it was still wheelchair accessible so
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't sloped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was up higher so that every shot
from across the way, it basically blocked
[SPEAKER_01]: us completely out of there because we were
underneath his shoulders basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably down to his elbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a way easier way to get on TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to city council.
[SPEAKER_03]: They give you five minutes to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Live on television.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Rogan doesn't have to catch you in the
side view, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go be on TV for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So speaking of Joe Rogan being on a video,
shout out to Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That show was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big respect to Melissa.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys don't know Melissa at
ComedyWorks, then you don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else am I going to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: We watched a culture high tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited these dudes over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rented it from iTunes, which I've never
rented anything from iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels kind of weird to pay $4.99 to
watch something for 24 hours on my
[SPEAKER_02]: computer, but okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was worth my $4.99.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to take some notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came to a really easy conclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe I haven't said that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only fucking thing I wrote
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was his only show note and Jeff beat
him to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to hit pause?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might just have to bleep out a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to say it with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It deserves to be said as a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, fuck Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck Nancy Grace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone should check out the culture
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth a watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sit your parents down, have them watch it
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch it as a family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it to someone that's maybe not open
minded, but willing to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all willing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's one of your favorite speakers in
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did write down a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Howard Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets all old mannish and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like his jowl start.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: But his message is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's your favorite dude in the show,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a toss up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge fan of Judge James Gray.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge fan of Dr. Lester Greenspoon,
and they're both heavy narrators in the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed Burns, the guy that did The Wire,
is featured in it talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Lester Greenspoon wrote life changing
books on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of the, like the researchers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Harvard trained, works at Harvard
researching cannabis for the last,
[SPEAKER_03]: what, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just incredible, incredible
speakers to have gathered for this
[SPEAKER_03]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I keep interrupting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many years do you think, like,
he worked for, he's like ex, D-I-D-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Burns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed Burns.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was, I can't remember which law
enforcement agency, he was a cop for a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole bunch of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a murder detective for a whole
bunch of years in Baltimore, I believe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those dudes always have some stories,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, and it's, we have more of them
that come over to our side than they,
[SPEAKER_01]: than, you know, like the druggies clean up
and go to the cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Law enforcement against prohibition is an
awesome group that's made up fully of ex
[SPEAKER_03]: judges, cops, detectives, DA agents that
just saw that prohibition doesn't do
[SPEAKER_03]: anything but harm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might come from an interesting
place of trying to prevent drug use,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it doesn't do that at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of not being effective at all,
but its main goal, it's also incredibly
[SPEAKER_03]: harmful to the society.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you're attempting to try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also had clips from Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw Snoop Dizzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw Lester Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Redban was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people might not know who that
is, but I know who he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shout out to Brian Redban.
[SPEAKER_02]: B-Real was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also, they proved Mr. Nice was in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, who was your favorite?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just, I got attachments to all of
them because, you know, just industry
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look up to a lot of those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually show that cannabis,
scientifically they proved that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: does not cause schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They reminded me- They talk a lot about
that research in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that lead in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis was outlawed in 1937 and they
actually mentioned that alcohol poisoning
[SPEAKER_02]: causes 250,000 deaths per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you catch the tobacco numbers?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 500,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: They compare it to the Holocaust.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Holocaust around the planet every year
due to tobacco consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of not just the Jewish people,
but also of the German soldiers that died
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember how they broke it down,
but it's like five and a half million
[SPEAKER_03]: people around the globe die every year due
to tobacco consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: has held up as a model around the world is
the place that has pushed tobacco
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption down to record levels with
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really all we did is we check ID at
the point of sale and we tell every school
[SPEAKER_03]: kid, if you smoke tobacco, it will lead to
these health effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: We give them the legitimate information on
tobacco and that's all we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a few catchy kind of teenager
commercials.
[SPEAKER_03]: They threw a couple of million dollars
every year at crazy teen smoking ads and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The really effective stuff is just sitting
the kid down in health class and being
[SPEAKER_03]: like, this is your nice pink lung.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the black lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember those videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do a couple of things before we
have to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's next.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was stumbling across the internet and
everywhere I go, there's videos of grandma
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking weed for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think I can play it with sound and
not get in trouble or should I just cut
[SPEAKER_02]: the sound out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, for legal reasons, you might
want to hit pause, I think, just to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll watch it and I'll just keep the
volume to where we can't hear it so it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't go to the recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, everybody bring it up real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead and type in right now,
search for grandma smoking weed for the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a second to search for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one with the three nice green moss
and bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's three ladies, pink and purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three old ladies wearing pink and
purple and they got a purple bong in front
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the video you're searching for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get any weird parody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit play right now and then
I'm going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys need a minute to catch up,
I'll give you a second and then I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to hit play on three, two, one,
play.
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube's loading.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry I failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it starts off with an old lady
taking a bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking a bong, it starts off with another
old lady taking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't clear it, they just fill it and
then they leave it all smoky.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're first timers, don't judge them too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm trying to narrate here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a six minute video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we'll do all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, not six minutes probably,
but we'll talk through a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grandma smoking weed for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very well produced video.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a nice camera too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tease the sound quality
because I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our cigarettes and our cocktails
and we were happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've never smoked marijuana before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to listen to it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crank it up and just enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'll watch it when I can one time,
but I don't want to get us in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the quotes that are beautiful
when the vaporizer gets down on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me jump in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude is about to light the bong for
this nice looking old lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: She pulled it closer to her face.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's showing her what's about to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's shaking the lighter because it won't
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: She keeps shaking it when she tries to
light it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now she's toking, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's pulling a toke.
[SPEAKER_02]: She did not carve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not enough to carve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't instructed to as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were instructed to do everything till
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one old lady, I'd say she's probably
the older of the three.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just took a pretty nice bong rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start ripping in here in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's definitely smoked a Cajuca before.
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes back for seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Betty White looking chick is about to
line up for a dab or for a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope they had some nice munchies
after this video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was laughing so hard the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of smoke coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it said in the beginning was they
gave them snacks and they gave them drinks
[SPEAKER_01]: and they gave them pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cannabis and went with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get myself taken off of
fucking iTunes, but I'm going to put some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the volume in for one minute later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, we want to listen to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get myself in trouble,
but five minutes later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to let it play.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long video, so we'll put some clips
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to feel it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go ahead and tell you basically from
memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to feel it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three grandmas getting super high for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're playing Jenga.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she starts playing with it with her
second hand and the other chick's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not supposed to play with your
second hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She couldn't even do it with two hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifteen minutes later, we'll turn it up
for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pull out a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going through my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of looks like a sex toy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the vaporizer that's been produced
looks like a dildo with a straw coming out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now she's toking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's actually hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to jump in a couple of minutes
because I don't want to watch these old
[SPEAKER_02]: ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the quotes that they say throughout
this that make it an insanely popular
[SPEAKER_03]: video.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're high now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it on their faces.
[SPEAKER_02]: The middle old lady's eyes are just
blasted red.
[SPEAKER_02]: 35 minutes later, we'll give you some
volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just playing card games.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it'd be the South or queefing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Queefing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody know what queefing is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Queefing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody know what that really is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very modern word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there more terminology?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is three stoned grandmas about to
learn what queefing means.
Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fooling around a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy says, since you're cool,
I'll go ahead and tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it just shows the definition and one
of them is vaginal farting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn it back up because you want to
hear the reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't show it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's do that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer is something like Pussyfarts
the musical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get in trouble for playing
too much of this video, but it's on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we should be able to play it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because this shit's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell they're visibly high,
but nothing goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are old ladies that one's got like a
damn sweater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shawl maybe, but it looks like a
fucking blanket wrapped around her.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lady's got a scarf.
[SPEAKER_02]: These look like lunch ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's videos like this that take all the
scary out of cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there at the end, the main purpose of
the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do we want to spoil that for
everybody or do we want them to watch?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, go and watch this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go search for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be worth your while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's six minutes long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to do the whole thing on
the show because we're running out of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think it's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys would approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did I want to do on the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it to your grandma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it to your grandma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it to your grandma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show her that you can smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it'd be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grandma already saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's creepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's creepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we've gone just about an hour
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve of the movie, A Culture High.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Joe Rogan show kicked ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this grandma smoking weed video
was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have some stuff to watch on
TV, if you're bored, pull up your phone,
[SPEAKER_02]: pull up your computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be worth your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Instagram on iRegenetics is getting
close to 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of this video says no grandmas
were harmed in the making of this video,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is clever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Instagram is at 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at 9,400 and something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could get you guys to follow and get
me up to 10,000, that'd be super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at iRegenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't ask you guys to do a lot of
things.

Yep.

[SPEAKER_03]: I don't take pictures of anything but my
dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like people have seen other
people's dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they poop in weird places?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two males and a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male's got some poop issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vigor lover grows mids.
