[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm super stoned today, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've eaten close to like 500 milligrams
today, so bear with me, I guess,
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I heard you took a little nap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for getting out of bed to come hang
out with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The listeners like having you here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Directly in front of me is the man,
the myth, the legend, Mr. Bobo Blastrico,
[SPEAKER_06]: also known as Chris.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, how was Portugal?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you do any Portuguese drugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually finally got asked for an
offered hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm turning down the music.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish you guys could see the look of
disappointment in my face.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were in Portugal where everything is
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with my mom and my stepdad.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, party's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with my mom when I got offered hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mom was like, oh, what did that guy
over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, the guy with the polo
shirt offered me hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, your shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you got some BHO, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some turpax over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, hasheesh, hasheesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad you made it back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy that you didn't try any
Portuguese drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: How was Florida?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: That awesome Florida-ish feeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Soup balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you brought a hot date back from
Florida with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: My four-legged awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the dog's name again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Layla.
[SPEAKER_06]: Layla.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome home, Layla.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you're back, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabs, dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: To my left, my nine o'clock-ish position,
you guys, you know who he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Bramble King.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike is back on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for joining me, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everyone is perfectly high for
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This episode is thoroughly baked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we're a little too dabbed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we're not dabbed enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I've had too much caffeine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're doing all right today.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be a good fucking show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to settle in and do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: The main beef of this podcast,
the main heart and soul is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody sent me an email and they wanted
to know, since not a lot of our friends
[SPEAKER_06]: who are working dispensaries and I've been
in a dispensary environment for the past
[SPEAKER_06]: several years, we got a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to know about what's the
craziest shit we have ever seen in a
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensary or at a smoke event.
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we get to that, I want to do a
couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do Kip's first because his name is
Kip and that's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never met anybody in person whose
name was Kip, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to be cool as shit if your name is
Kip.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means you got cool parents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kip, shout out to Kip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I found Kip on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, I have some plants that I need
that I had a friend take care of during a
[SPEAKER_06]: trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though on average he's a decent
grower, he put my 10 inch plants with his
[SPEAKER_06]: that were a few feet high and didn't raise
them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were severely stretched,
almost eight inches between nodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, on average I'd waste them and
start new stock, but I'm currently out of
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds and clones due to the trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't have any good candidates for
clones other than the tops of the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's your answer right there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes on to say, if it wasn't the last
of the genetics I had, I'd waste them or
[SPEAKER_06]: pull the tops and clone it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm wondering if you had any quick
ways to maybe get a plant to put out some
[SPEAKER_06]: shoots so I have something to clip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm running 600 watt HPS at the time,
age old newts in dirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually use nectar of the gods,
but I can't see spending a fortune to
[SPEAKER_06]: raise these plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any help would be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put them into bigger pots and top
them and they'll start shooting out more
[SPEAKER_06]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them a high phosphorus diet with a
lot of nitrogen and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll spit out more shoots.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a product called Bushmaster
that'll make them shoot out more shoots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put them into bigger pots, feed them a
good diet and they'll shoot out more
[SPEAKER_06]: shoots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them plenty of light, give them
plenty of space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Top them, do some topping and pinching
techniques.
[SPEAKER_06]: But your main answer to your question is
what's left there is the tops of those
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clone those, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clone those right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get those healthy tops cloned in a cloner,
labeled, get them rooted and then take
[SPEAKER_06]: really good care of those new clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the solution for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kip, I appreciate the message on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have any more questions,
please send them to me on Facebook or hit
[SPEAKER_06]: me up at rollfromyourheartathotmail.com
and I will read your messages on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm searching for an email I've
got.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do one more email and then
we're going to talk about the crazy shit
[SPEAKER_06]: that these folks have seen in
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's looking at me like,
I want to talk about dispensary shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys start thinking about it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your stories brewing in your heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some interesting shit you saw at Metamar,
some crazy shit that's happened to you
[SPEAKER_06]: over at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you've been to dispensaries and
seen some crazy shit also, Bobo,
[SPEAKER_06]: so get those stories cooking in your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we talk about the smoke shop too?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, that's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that stuff, secret sash, cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all fair game in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, this email though.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one is, I think I already said his
name.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I'm supposed to say his
name.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said his name out loud once already.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may edit that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, what's going on, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I burned through all the episodes on
Stitcher in about a week and I have to
[SPEAKER_06]: wait painfully from week to week for each
new episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are 10 episodes available on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to my website,
ireageneticscolorado.com, there are 100
[SPEAKER_06]: episodes available on there for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last 100 episodes are up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want more episodes, other than
that, send me an email and I will consider
[SPEAKER_06]: sending you files of the shit that's not
up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do need to post some of the older stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some stuff that was really useful
that has phased out.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of episodes were really helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those early episodes had a lot of
heavy grow information.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may go throw some of those out,
like mid-week episodes, just as bonus
[SPEAKER_06]: repeat.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, he says, I have found that
what it... Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being from an illegal state of
Pennsylvania, I cannot take your advice in
[SPEAKER_06]: the literal sense due to legalities.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I have found that what is good
for the cannabis plant is also good for
[SPEAKER_06]: some vegetable plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adding organic nutrients such as compost
teas and trimming techniques like
[SPEAKER_06]: lollipopping have done wonders for my
tomatoes and hot peppers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that's applicable to your outdoor
veggie garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes on to say, I also welcome the
great advice from White Mike on the legal
[SPEAKER_06]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Recently in Pennsylvania, the Senate and
House unanimously passed a bill allowing
[SPEAKER_06]: for restricted hemp production for
university research.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's currently awaiting the final
signature from Governor Tom Wolf.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a dude named Tom Wolf.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also says, I know we are miles behind
Colorado, but I guess we need to start
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: He continues with, my wife and I will have
the pleasure of visiting your fine state
[SPEAKER_06]: next week.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll probably be by the time this
podcast airs.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to email him before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he says, we are overjoyed and have
been counting down for weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will of course be flying into Denver,
into the Denver area and beginning our
[SPEAKER_06]: adventure from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: My first question is, do you have any
recommendations for recreational
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensaries in the Denver region?
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure we establish a
reputable place with products that are
[SPEAKER_06]: grown from the heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then a second question is, do you think
you could do an episode on how to
[SPEAKER_06]: troubleshoot and solve different signs of
nutrient burn and or nutrient
[SPEAKER_06]: deficiencies?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a potassium deficiency,
you would see these signs as opposed to
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrogen deficiency, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would make a great
informative episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, that episode is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch ching screenshot of your email so
that I'll remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will do that episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he says, anyway, before I keep
rambling, don't worry, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say, you are very good at
your career and give great advice.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever have any photography
questions, don't hesitate to hit me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome to someday meet you
and do some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: But until then, give my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Best of luck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he says, you can just call me Fats if
you decide to read this on the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks, Fats.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will edit your name out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had two questions for you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: He asked about a recreational dispensary
recommendation in the Denver area.
[SPEAKER_06]: I unfortunately have no clue where to tell
you to go because I don't buy recreational
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grow and then I'm a master grower at a
shop where I just go there and pick up
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers on that employee discount,
smoke those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody in the room have a
recommendation for a reputable dispensary
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Denver area?
[SPEAKER_08]: Google reviews, honestly, that's your best
bet is to hop on your phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: The clinic has always been one of my
favorite places to send people.
[SPEAKER_06]: The clinic has a rec side.
[SPEAKER_06]: The clinic is a great place in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their flowers are always quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't guarantee anything about the...
Oh, look, we got a text message from
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody in the other room listening and
they say Natty Rems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So go to Natty Rems.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say the only thing I
can really recommend is places.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been into Natty Rems and it's
actually a very nice... They take green
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions, Billy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say green solutions as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been over a year since I've been into
a shop in Denver and I honestly can't
[SPEAKER_08]: remember if the last two were rec or med.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say fly into Denver, get to your
hotel, get on your phone, download the
[SPEAKER_06]: weed maps app, and then just look what's
near your hotel and then read reviews for
[SPEAKER_06]: a few of those places.
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't hit just one place, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to a couple of places, check them out,
get the experience because every place is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to have a different vibe of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be different music at the
spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: The music is loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's reggae in your face as soon as you
get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a real salesy environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want you to buy, buy, buy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things are set up to where it's like
impulse buys right where you need them and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's got that kind of flow to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Green and healthy on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the owner, he wanted to set it up
more with the art gallery sort of a feel
[SPEAKER_06]: and it does have that sort of a feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more spread out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more spacious.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's artwork everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so every dispensary and the quality of
product from the two shops is amazingly
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking different.
[SPEAKER_08]: The selections are different too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, every shop is going to have its
own vibe, its own selection, its own way
[SPEAKER_08]: of doing things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially if you're from
Pennsylvania, it's worth hitting several
[SPEAKER_08]: just to check out the different ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're also going to want to make time to
hit illusion's glass gallery downtown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're definitely not to,
yeah, it's somewhere you're going to want
[SPEAKER_08]: to stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just make, make sure it's part of
your trip and be careful smoking in your
[SPEAKER_06]: hotel.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may think that because you're in
Colorado, now we can smoke out the hotel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Negative, negative.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure that you've got a marijuana
friendly room.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're worried about calling and
asking the hotel, just call it from your
[SPEAKER_08]: phone and pretend like you're lost or
coming next week and want to know what
[SPEAKER_08]: their policy is.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll be happy to explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to say, if you're going to
smoke in your room or do something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, I would highly recommend looking
into things like the smoke buddy and the
[SPEAKER_04]: like scented candles from smoke shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that are actually like,
yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you set off the smoke alarm,
they will charge you the 250 or $500
[SPEAKER_06]: cleaning fee, depending on how bougie the
hotel is.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll charge you for that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the smoke buddy, a little vape
pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your, aren't you repping a new vape
pen company?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the name of that pen?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can, you can shout them out on the
show since you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, kinetic products is what they are on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their website to order stuff will be up
and running on the 25th of this month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, and I don't actually have the
exact website for that yet, but you can
[SPEAKER_04]: check them out on Instagram at kinetic
products and they have a, um, wax pen that
[SPEAKER_04]: has a quartz coil in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been bragging about it for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spell kinetic for us, because I think when
you say kinetic, I see with a K,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's the Colorado C.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's C A N.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I can, uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, they ultra did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's C A N N E T I C dot products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Help out our listeners a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Kip, your second question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, first question was dispensary
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make an episode on troubleshooting and
solving problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually got it written down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be a really in depth.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those long episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to write out and really plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a lot of stuff to think
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to find a starting point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the starting point is printing out
that chart that shows you all the leads
[SPEAKER_06]: with fucked up problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to want to include in the
show notes for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did just smack the microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smack the shit out of that mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a bad kid beat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, what am I supposed to call you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Fats Fats, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for sending us an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're in Denver, contact me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Message me somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be like, I am about to land in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a busy man, honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Denver is 125 miles from my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 60 miles from my work, but you never
know because I go to Denver and do some
[SPEAKER_06]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doug Benson might be in town.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If Doug Benson have secret sessions,
it's the way it could be.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be here during a secret session.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, the dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you looked at me, I was like,
I was like, what I'm going to secret
[SPEAKER_06]: session.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe maybe here during secret session.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, either way, bro, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know that you're coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, email me just like you did and let me
know a little more accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your details.
[SPEAKER_06]: This episode will probably come out by the
time your trip already happened,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm going to message you and make sure
that we get in touch with each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope you hear this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you hear us talking about you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, your trip that already happened to us,
it's in the future to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I tease this part at the start of the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to talk about the craziest shit
we've ever seen in a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dispensary or at a smokey vent or at a
cannabis cup or at the dab lounge,
[SPEAKER_06]: some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Lindsay's taking a drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna let Mike go first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, uh, Mike and I ran, let's give you a
little background story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike and I ran the first and only
dispensary in city limits in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this dispensary was located right at
the middle of the city.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the east side of our town is hood as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of face tattoos.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, there's a lot of pocket knives.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of use guys is, uh,
it's not, it's not the prettiest place to
[SPEAKER_06]: go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all those people came and then,
uh, we had people from all parts of
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was back in the purely medical day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was just anybody who had or wanted a
medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_06]: There would be, we had probably 10 seats
inside the place and there would be people
[SPEAKER_06]: in every chair and then standing outside
waiting to come in still.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a receptionist and myself as
a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I hired Mike as a backup bud
tender.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I couldn't get through everybody
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my second week, we hired the
security guard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, we were really inventing shit as
we went along, just making it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: The industry was being invented is there
was no badge.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no time clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would show up.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was barely other dispensaries that
you could go check out and steal stuff and
[SPEAKER_08]: ideas from.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you now, if you're thinking about
opening a dispenser, you can just go to a
[SPEAKER_08]: hundred of them and pick like the 10
things you like about your favorites.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back then there wasn't even that the boss
would pay me to drive to Denver on the,
[SPEAKER_06]: if I was going to a concert, he'd be like,
here's some money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop at a couple of dispensaries,
pick up some advertisements and some
[SPEAKER_06]: product and see what they got.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he'd just throw me money to go do
recon work and come back and kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: adjust our shit to be a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time we went crazy old dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so Mike and I ran the first place and
I had some fucking crazy experiences in
[SPEAKER_06]: that place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote down just to, just to give you a
tease of my list, threats, plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: gun chat trades, and gifts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the gifts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember the lady that gave us the
piece?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what I meant by gifts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: This older lady kind of looked like maybe
a 55, 65 year old, a better biker.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was probably 30 though, to tell you
the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like sometimes the wind's mean,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's normal transaction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing surprising or interesting about it
until right at the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, you too, are sweet here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: She reaches into her purse and pulls out
this little plastic bag with this black.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like old bubblegum and pocket
lint.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was black and in like stringy,
I guess is how I would describe it.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, here's some opium for y'all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just kind of walked off.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just know what fake skin looks like
from Halloween, that thin layer of fake
[SPEAKER_06]: skin.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it dries on your skin, it kind of
looked like that folded up in a
[SPEAKER_06]: cellophane.
[SPEAKER_08]: That place was bizarre.
[SPEAKER_08]: The, my favorite people there were the
kids coming there to sell, sell weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just wander in with a terrified look
on their face with a little messenger bag
[SPEAKER_08]: that they were kind of hugging to their
side.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they go, is there a manager around?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just terrified.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause this was in the beginning when like
you could have as much marijuana as you
[SPEAKER_08]: had medical cards for, but it was still
400 an ounce, like end of story.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they're hauling around a lot more
money than they're comfortable with on
[SPEAKER_08]: their hip.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as most people are concerned,
that's a major crime.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they just want it into a store to try
and sell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's a weird experience, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'd get like three of those,
four of those guys a day sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made a lot of friends from those folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them were really talented.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would offer those guys 800 a quarter
pound or 3,200 a pound to take it or leave
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could get 900 out of me if it was
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of those people would just look
at me like, oh, like they wanted so much
[SPEAKER_06]: more for that bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back then, now wholesale commercial herb
is about $2,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you could find it if you're looking
for like some outdoor commercial,
[SPEAKER_06]: like rec weed, like some, oh, do I want to
drop any dispensary names?
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff that you'd get over there at
that one spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a hundred bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably like $1,500 a pound,
you know, 1,400 a pound to get that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've gotten way cheaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Mike, what's one of your
fucking craziest memories you have from
[SPEAKER_06]: Metamarket?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many bizarre ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: The you two falling down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Edibles, one of the managers,
owners would make, they were all homemade.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were all delicious and they were all
insanely potent.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was sweet and she would kind of
insist that you eat like one of everything
[SPEAKER_08]: when she'd bring in a new batch.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so by like mid day or lunch,
you'd be like too high to form words
[SPEAKER_08]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And watching a coworker tumble down a
switch back stair and then land,
[SPEAKER_08]: like it's sprawled out face first in front
of a lobby full of customers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they just pop up and they're
like, who's next?
[SPEAKER_08]: Quickest way down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hauling all the plants out of there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We loaded up an RV or was it the RV time
or the time we did the U-Haul truck?
[SPEAKER_08]: When we got shut down, it was just,
you have to stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were like, okay, we'll stop then.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've got all this shit in the store.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we do with it?
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically all of the plants that were
in the grow were just, if you want them,
[SPEAKER_08]: hauler.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for like half a day from like noon
to midnight, randomly people would pull up
[SPEAKER_08]: out back, walk around, knock on the door,
come inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd pick out the half dozen or dozen or
whatever plants they had paperwork for and
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Loaded whatever vehicle they had,
they'd bail.
[SPEAKER_08]: My backyard was packed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one of the stranger experiences of
my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was a lot of fun to be like,
at one point there was a U-Haul and the
[SPEAKER_08]: dude had, was a caregiver for like 11
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we sat there and went through his
paperwork for like 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_08]: double checking everything and then
loaded.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh fuck dude, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time we got that back of that
U-Haul loaded, I was sweating so bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: We moved a lot of plants around at that
place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like sketchy moved plants around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Recently I had a dude show up.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just in bed, maybe 350 pounds,
maybe 45 years old, but like life's been
[SPEAKER_08]: rough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this the new dig?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is the new place.
[SPEAKER_08]: He comes walking up to the door and our
security guard's like, uh-uh.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like halfway to that door,
we noticed that like there's a good wobble
[SPEAKER_08]: to his walk too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he gets to the front door and he's
like, there's the weed store.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the security guard's like,
no sir, you can't come in.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, why not?
[SPEAKER_08]: The security guard's like, well,
A, you're barefoot.
[SPEAKER_08]: B, you're not wearing a shirt,
you're topless.
[SPEAKER_08]: And C, you're drunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like sir, you have to leave.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, no, this is the weed store.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he like goes to push past my armed
security guard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the security guard blocks his way
and is like, sir, you really can't come
[SPEAKER_08]: in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, you're barefoot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not wearing a shirt.
[SPEAKER_08]: He goes, Jesus was barefoot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like that doesn't mean we're going to
let you into our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, there's, that's just random
stuff that's popping in my mind right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've taken some dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they're stranger shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just keep seeing you fall down those
stairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, one time I was sitting at Medamar and
the reason I mentioned the thugs that used
[SPEAKER_06]: to come in, uh, there was a bunch of
normal people and then like a group of
[SPEAKER_06]: like four or five youngster gangster kind
of kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were all talking about their gun
collections.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could see the white folk just like,
just cringing, just like, we're all going
[SPEAKER_06]: to fuck and die in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see it on all their faces.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of the funniest fucking
things I remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, you're not, you don't wear,
uh, Chris, you don't work in a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm sure you've seen some whack ass
shit somewhere to smoke club or
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just see the craziest shit inside
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people think just because it's legal,
they can just say whatever the hell they
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't a law free zone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's just, we have legal weed stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you go in with your friends and
then your friend passes you all the money,
[SPEAKER_01]: you say, yeah, I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay shaking her head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, you have to leave now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some guy come in the dispensary the
other day and he was like buying an ounce
[SPEAKER_04]: of flour and he was, he said something
about it was for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, this is for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like you, you can't say that in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this is your one warning,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, well, it's not a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gifting him this bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, no, no, you're not allowed
to take your medical card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't anybody's birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go and buy.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's different rules for rec and
medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you're in a medical shop,
you have to play by the height of the
[SPEAKER_08]: medical rules is, is legally it's
essentially you're, you're at a pharmacy
[SPEAKER_08]: and the pharmacist is like, here's your
pills.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're like, cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give them to my cousin,
Billy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do that two or three times and the
pharmacist is going to go fuck you and
[SPEAKER_08]: your pills.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you ain't getting these and I'm
calling the cops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you actually sign a member agreement
and green and healthy wellness that says
[SPEAKER_06]: in bold letters, I will not redistribute
this medicine to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what our main concern there
is that you're not going, nobody needs to
[SPEAKER_06]: get that medicine from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they need that medicine, they have the
means to get that product legally
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need to be, we don't need to be,
you don't need a middleman for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need to know about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If once you take that cannabis home and
take it out of the black package that
[SPEAKER_06]: we've sold it to you in, um, and sometimes
time passes, we don't know what happens
[SPEAKER_06]: after that and we can't care, but don't
tell us about it and take it out of our
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter what you do with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, now it's your cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then whatever can happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can, you can give your cannabis to
people, but not the stuff you got a green
[SPEAKER_06]: and healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got something to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see your face now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a poignant message to hang around the
smoke shop with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hang around the smoke shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensary, which was still the oddest
thing too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's actually really odd.
[SPEAKER_04]: That really doesn't have anything to do
with weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, uh, was working in the smoke shop one
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Saturday and me and my manager
were both on the floor and I had some guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was showing him some hand pipe and I
was, I guess I should explain that I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have hair on the sides of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I have the sides of my head shaved
and I was like, I had my head down and I
[SPEAKER_04]: was like pulling out a pipe to show him
and he reaches across the counter and he
[SPEAKER_04]: takes his hand and he runs it across the
side of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just was like, um, please don't
touch me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I didn't think that I had to make
that an out loud rule, but please don't
[SPEAKER_04]: touch me.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to have this guy as similar lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy used to come in and he was kind
of a nightmarish customer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like he did not typically have a pleasant
smell to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, he was typically dressed in,
in like, took too much acid, went to
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodwill.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wondered if that's who you were going
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, but he had a car that didn't
match his wardrobe and odor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it was like a better kept up like
early 2000s, like Corvette, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and he's shopping and he, he buys like
$6 worth of something or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot, not a lot of money worth of
flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: And his, uh, my coworkers stapling his bag
shut.
[SPEAKER_08]: He goes, I just got new carpet in my trunk
and the two girls I'm working with are
[SPEAKER_08]: like, what an odd thing to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just kind of look at him and they're
like, oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes, you two want to come outside
and smell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was like three heartbeats where
all three of us that were at work that
[SPEAKER_08]: night were like, he just fucking said,
he said, smell it, not look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just so smooth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Jess goes, no, sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually, we're not allowed to leave
the store until after closing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a rule.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just smooth as anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I half believed it when she said it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was she ever a stripper?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like a stripper line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: In what world would you go out to
someone's car and even, wait, no,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, okay, sniff, sniffing is
really funny, but like in what world would
[SPEAKER_04]: you even go and look at someone's new
carpet in their trunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: You obviously just killed somebody and
threw them in the trunk and got your
[SPEAKER_04]: carpet redone back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you want me to go out there and be
the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should keep it a secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell anybody about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got this trunk I just cleaned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty tired back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, throws on the UV light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you can't even see the spots
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Jesus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that one stands way out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember when people used to bring
plants into Metamar that had problems?
[SPEAKER_06]: They brought a big old plant and a fucking
like a Walmart bag and a pot and a potted
[SPEAKER_06]: plant with leaves just sticking out and he
carries it in and he opens up and it's all
[SPEAKER_06]: coated in powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, get that the fuck out of here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we got plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he's bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told him what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, that's that's only
solvable by fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like as bad as that is, that just needs
fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just got to have just.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember you like just kind of mumbling
under your breath like, fuck, dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: now I'm going to have to shower like three
times before I get my garden chores done
[SPEAKER_08]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because just one fool after another had
brought in a potted plant with like a
[SPEAKER_08]: paper trash bag, like gently set over the
little stand up support sticks so that
[SPEAKER_08]: they could kind of hide what they were,
what kind of plant they were carrying in
[SPEAKER_08]: public view as they brought it into the
dispensary to try to get us to diagnose
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking people opening up shit with spider
mites on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: People leaving our place with clones and
not giving a fuck just carrying.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sold clones in cups and you could buy
if you're plant count was one hundred and
[SPEAKER_06]: forty, we'd sell you one hundred and forty
clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't give a shit back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people would leave with just trays of
clones in their hands, like six inch tall
[SPEAKER_06]: plants in cups, just carrying them out to
the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we didn't care at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember one guy coming back like two or
three days in a row, maybe six trips total
[SPEAKER_08]: and buying like two clones at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I asked him, like, what the hell
is going on?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was he goes, I keep sending them
out back so they get used to the light and
[SPEAKER_08]: the birds keep eating them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, dude, you're on clones like
seven and eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, come up with a plan, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a shotgun, like get some chicken wire,
put them inside like something set up by
[SPEAKER_08]: the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of bringing things into the
dispensary, I'm friends with the person,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I'm not going to say where or any of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But somebody came into a place that I work
and brought in a product that they wanted
[SPEAKER_04]: us to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the entire dome on the pen was just
like this color in the bright orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, you know, the like dome
open globe, like open glass could not even
[SPEAKER_04]: see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, you can't have that
in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are on camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have people pulling vaporizers out of
their pocket left and right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a weird bag of returned ones that
we've got like the receipts and like as
[SPEAKER_08]: much documentation as we can because we
send them back to the company for
[SPEAKER_08]: replacement units.
[SPEAKER_08]: But half of them are like burn out and a
tiny bit dirty.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we keep epic records on all of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that there's no that's a daily
occurrence.
[SPEAKER_08]: People pulling shit like that out of their
pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, at the place you work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to be careful how I ask this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you get a prize for wearing a small
shirt?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends who's working there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some of the random shit that I've
seen happen at that place.
[SPEAKER_08]: How crazy it's it is during that day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, sometimes we'll see a couple
hundred people in a day and weird things
[SPEAKER_08]: happen when it's that crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the summer, if you shop at Mike's
dispensary and you're in like a bikini,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a good chance you'll get some
gifts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Free T-shirts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny when you watch all the dudes
that work there, the older manager dudes
[SPEAKER_06]: try to stumble over Mike to get the
fucking young customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are TDBs.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to tell a ridiculous story
that happened to me one time when I worked
[SPEAKER_06]: at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: This probably be the last one of these
crazy stories for this episode because I
[SPEAKER_06]: thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one day I was working at work at the
dispensary selling good old weed and it
[SPEAKER_06]: was myself and my receptionist is I guess
what she would officially be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her name was Tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: She probably weighed 90 pounds and was
afraid of the wind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like she was, she was a very tiny little
choosing here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one day a normal customer,
there were regular customers that would
[SPEAKER_06]: come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: She wasn't even a lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to call her a lady because
of what she did.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was a female.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was large female and her husband was a
dude who was about equal size with me and
[SPEAKER_06]: they would come in often and I knew who
they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one day she came in early in the
morning and said, how much is an ounce?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told her an ounce is this much.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the time at that dispensary an ounce
was $320.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she said, if I come up with three,
will you do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was a regular customer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, don't tell anybody to hook you up
for 300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, if you send your old man in
later, I'll do it for three for him also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they got a baby and they switch
shifts and I just know how that should
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she comes back later and she's got like
200 and I don't even remember how it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she comes in like way later.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about to close and she comes back in
and she's like, hey, sell me an ounce for
[SPEAKER_06]: like 250 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, no, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it for three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any less than that, I'll get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like begging and I'm like,
I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, let me go out to the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: And see what I can come up with.
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes out to the car and they're out
there for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked her, I was like, what's going
on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause she can see the window and see their
car.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, they're kind of yelling at
each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be back in in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, cool, give them a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he came in and she's like, I need to
see your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you have to check in every time you
come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, nah, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk to that fucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh, someone's about to go
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it was me that he wanted to
talk to.
[SPEAKER_06]: He pushes past her and comes back to the
bud room where I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we got the bud room in the back of
the building.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can get privacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, motherfucker, you told my
wife that if she sucks your dick,
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd give her an ounce for 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, bro, I'm not interested in
your wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not my weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't give her that anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd never fucking say that to your
wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, you guys are regulars here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the fuck would I do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I'm not even trying to be
rude.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was not attractive.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was way, way not in my weight class.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was no thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like why would anybody want her to suck
their dick?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's going off on me, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, I'm going to fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's kind of a big dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's my size.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm fucking six, five.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had to be at least six, three or
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's straight in my eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was on the other side of the counter
and he kept hitting the counter and the
[SPEAKER_06]: counter is glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, he's going to break this
counter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I got to fucking figure this out
quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tree kept asking, do you want me to
call the cops?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want me to call the cops?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, no, I don't want the cops at
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the last thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to bring that to this
business already.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've got mace and I've got some
scissors within reach, like right within
[SPEAKER_06]: reach.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was starting to get shaky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I was getting that, like,
I'm about to fight this motherfucker is
[SPEAKER_06]: like the feeling that I had in my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, this shit's about to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, you motherfucker,
you told my wife that if you sold her an
[SPEAKER_06]: ounce for, you'd sell her an ounce if she
sucked your dick.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Tree starts yelling, I was right
fucking here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All this between Tree and I and the office
in the bedroom is a tapestry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, that's all that was a black
tapestry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, I was right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't fucking say any of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I can hear everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, when he turned his head,
I grabbed the mace and the scissors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grabbed the mace with my right hand and
the scissors with my left hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by now his girlfriend came in too and
was backing him up and left.
[SPEAKER_06]: They left the baby in the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I told him, bro, you're kind of
threatening me and I'm not sure what to do
[SPEAKER_06]: about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to fucking mace you and then
I'm going to stab you and then I'm going
[SPEAKER_06]: to mace your fucking wife.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm going to call the cops if you
guys don't get out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tree looked at me like, wow,
I've never seen that side of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause everybody just knows me as this
peaceful dude that grows weed and smokes a
[SPEAKER_06]: ton of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And fucking as a bud tender and I'm all
laid back and I show up like five minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: late and I'm fucking cool with everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now she sees me about to spray
some dude in his face, stab him with
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking trim scissors, and then go after
his girl with the mace.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only thing that saved me from
fighting was when I told him, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_06]: spray you, stab you, and then I'm going to
spray your girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_06]: She looked at him like, um, I don't want
to get maced, baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: This idea ain't working no more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's when it all kind of started to
fucking cool down.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know where you work and I'll find you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I'm here every day,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, but that was honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fucking like, I've got a lot of
adrenaline right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just telling that story.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought that dude and I wasn't long
after that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got the security guard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was like, bro, I can't be here by
myself with fucking 20 pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We hit because at that point, I mean,
we were brand new and we were getting like
[SPEAKER_08]: two calls a month from people that would
say like random horrible shit into the
[SPEAKER_08]: phone because we were stealing their
business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they didn't like the idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a dispensary in town.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we should have a security guard long
before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the security guard we got was
pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: One day I was driving down Northern
Avenue, one of the main streets here in
[SPEAKER_06]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I see the security guard.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're both going to Medamar to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the bud tender.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got to get there at the same time as
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we open right when we get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're driving down the street and he
pulls up next to me and he goes,
[SPEAKER_06]: damn, I say that smells good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was smoking a big old fat ass joint
on my way to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I took a big old hit off of it and I
was like, I'm high enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I go, roll down your window.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he rolled down his window all the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was in the right lane.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in the left lane.
[SPEAKER_06]: He put his hand out and I threw that
fucking joint from my car into his
[SPEAKER_06]: passenger window, directly into his hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: He caught that fucker and didn't have to
make adjustments and just hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were so happy when they got to work
that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like Voltron just united,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We came together on that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, I told my craziest
story that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't cover events really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen people black the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend Katrina took, uh, she took a dab
and she looked at me.
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes, I'm so hungry and just fell the
fuck over, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I caught her, but, uh, we stayed in a
really swanky hotel the night before and
[SPEAKER_06]: they had free lotion and, uh, she lubed
herself up in all the damn lotion.
[SPEAKER_06]: She used it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I tried to catch her and it was trying
to like, trying to catch a fucking slid
[SPEAKER_06]: right out of my arms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had to catch her like three times and
then I finally got her all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awkward.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tony was with me and I go,
Tony, just pick her up and put her on my
[SPEAKER_06]: shoulders, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I was holding her just like,
she was like a wet noodle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he spun her around and threw up on
my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I got her and I spun her around and I
told him, pour this water on her face.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just gave him water and he was like
pouring water into her mouth and she
[SPEAKER_06]: started drinking it and woke up and I set
her down.
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes, how long was I asleep?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was all pale and shit for the rest of
the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: They defeat her twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this dude from Texas one time,
I took a fat dab, a fat, fat dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one that they did at the new
location.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what's the new place?
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver mart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver mart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did a fatty dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the old location.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did a big old fat dab and this guy came up
and he was from Texas.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's all, what y'all doing right there?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, it's dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, damn, I heard about dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: They ain't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get a dab?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tried to give him a little dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've told this story on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to give him a little dab and he's
like, nah, I saw you do one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a big one like you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I don't think you want to
do your first dab, like a Rasta Jeff sized
[SPEAKER_06]: dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, give me a damn old dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, you're going to get a damn
old dab, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I hooked him up and that dude took
a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time the last of the smoke hit
his lungs, I'm pretty sure part of the dab
[SPEAKER_06]: came out of that sinus part of your eye,
like where your eye and your nose meets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke came out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke came out of his ears.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke came out of his nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke came out of his mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'd have took off his pants,
I'm pretty sure some smoke was coming out
[SPEAKER_06]: of his butt hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that dude was just, he just blew up
with smoke and he looked at me and
[SPEAKER_06]: vanished.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where the fuck he went.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened to that dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just levitated into nowhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was gone, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit was so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went back to his car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: Left instantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Drove right back, went and slept in the
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the way that ran out of his car was,
what the hell was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: What did that wookie just give me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he drove to Texas and told
everybody about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rasta wizard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rasta wizard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes there'd be a nice offering you a
tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't, don't, you don't have to take your
relic dabs just cause I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't mean you need to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to my friends at Turpex for the
lovely work with the cascade shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shouldn't even talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys want to talk about these turps
for a minute?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been talking about the turps for a
couple of few episodes now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm amazed that they're still around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wiggling my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: My hat is pulling my dread.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to fix that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a large container, but it lasts
for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: These turps are amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys get to try the lemon G?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get to try the OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I tried the OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we may have to do some dunking and
zipping here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to lick the bottle if
you want to taste it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've tried the ghost, but the lemon G I've
heard about, but haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_08]: The ghost was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about ways to use it
earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like pouring the, uh,
OG Kush turps onto solventless hash like
[SPEAKER_06]: the, uh, 120 micron, uh, cream or blue
sherb hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just press out.
[SPEAKER_06]: See how this one's pressed right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like a little patty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pour a little drip on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty, uh, it's pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: The turps are pretty thick and kind of
viscous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got to pour quickly or it'll run
down the side of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to learn to get the angle going,
but I really love pouring it on the
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking solventless.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I poured some onto just a little piece
of shatter the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that I had a whole piece of shatter
with some on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course some dripped onto the oil
slick.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was dipping it up, uh, using shatter
and solventless and whatever I was
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking, just rubbing it in on the oil
slick.
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite way, honestly, is to get,
uh, a small ish dab and then just dunk it
[SPEAKER_06]: right into the turps and don't even go too
hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit of turps and then just
smoke it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually dropped a little bit of the,
uh, ghost training.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hayes turps directly onto the email head.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, uh, I made like the next
five or six or eight dabs tastes real
[SPEAKER_06]: chirpy, but it didn't last as long as I
had hoped for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Lindsay, you work at the store where
we're selling this medically.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are these going for for a quarter of
a gram?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, do you remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 60.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's 60 bucks a quarter gram
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: 65 for non members.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just be a member.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get the blue shirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get the cream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sign up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew all that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just come and get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the turps, the turps are fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get the turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, if you're a rec shopper, you can get
the turps at Natty Ram's call before you
[SPEAKER_06]: drive, because I don't know what they've
got.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, when this episode comes out,
they can be cleaned out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They could laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can be like the turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good fucking luck.
[SPEAKER_06]: But shout out to the crew that's making
the turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Evo lab crew,
because, uh, we've seen a lot of really
[SPEAKER_06]: cool cannabis products come out in the
past year, past two years, past whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, this one might be my favorite,
the turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: This might be the newest, greatest thing
to come out in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Mike?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some stuff recently that's
been impressive, but this kind of took it
[SPEAKER_08]: to another, a new place, a very fun new
place, a very connoisseur level.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like getting, I do like playing with the
distillate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like taking the distillate, the just,
uh, raw distill.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just 91% THC and eat a little tiny
dab of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like to dip it into the OG Kush and
then maybe put it in the lemon G after
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then maybe rub it on the ghost train.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, isn't to see what the different
mixtures do, but that, that honestly,
[SPEAKER_06]: that got old quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few times it was like, it was like
mixing jelly bellies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you're like, eh, I did that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, uh, I've been having some fun mixing
random hashes together.
[SPEAKER_08]: They plan with the different flavor
profiles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Combined it was good, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking down this table folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's like 12 different varieties of
hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's three different vials of turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's four vials of turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's insanely delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and distracting.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a dabalicious table.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've had, got this beautiful little
pancake of solvent list that's been
[SPEAKER_08]: taunting me this whole episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you smoke that whole thing,
you may not speak for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_08]: episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least 10 mic dabs on that little
pancake, which is funny because that's
[SPEAKER_08]: like a quarter Jeff dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but easily.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd put a drop of OG Kush turps on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be one fat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You started talking about dripping turps
on it and I looked, I looked down and
[SPEAKER_08]: went, Ooh, got sexier.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where combined did came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like giving, it's like giving hash a
boob job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put some turps on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like putting wheels on that
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spinners, but they look nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't gotta be spinners, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one needs spinners anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well kind of a 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they whistle.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, bubble, you got anything to add to
this wonderful podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the furniture table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys check out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it big?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cartel.burniture.com or is it burniture
.bigcartel.com?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So burniture.bigcartel.com check that shit
out and support it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Order a custom table.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a bad mo fro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contact him for custom art.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of email furniture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out the site.
[SPEAKER_06]: How long ago did you hook me up with that
email table?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been over a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't got no problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coils are still good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the workhorse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like one of the, one of the
originals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The paint needs a hug, but I mean
everything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got some miles on those tires now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've done a lot of videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I sent it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent it here to make sure it got put to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like, literally that was probably
like the third or fourth one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I'm going to send it to
Jeff cause I know he's going to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got a lot of use.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a lot of miles on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The coils are still working and I'm amazed
because I've used a couple of coils on
[SPEAKER_06]: this unit here in the same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: These coils aren't as good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I like the ones that look
more like a microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, if you're buying an email,
get the one with the coil that looks like
[SPEAKER_06]: a microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cable, not the one that looks like an XLR
cable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the other one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it doesn't look like an XLR,
that's not the one I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking to myself that I
remember when you were making that table
[SPEAKER_04]: in Florida, like I remember you and I
trying to figure out how you were going to
[SPEAKER_04]: paint it and you doing the tape and the
tape when you pulled it off or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the reason you pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You painted it because you originally were
going to do something on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you pulled up the paint,
that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you, when you put the tape
down and you pulled it up and you were
[SPEAKER_04]: like, and you were like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to do Jeff's thing on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going balls deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a really dope unboxing video on
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I watched that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually at her job, I think,
or I was walking in your job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we watched it when I was at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was like driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, Jeff just got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: The video may be on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't promise you the unboxing video
could be up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Lindsay needs a nap.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, sunshine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry we woke you up for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Five or six hundred or four or five
hundred?
[SPEAKER_04]: Four or five hundred.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing all right though for five hundred
milligrams.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say I had a power
nap.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhere between like eight and twelve
hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: A THC during the last secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was on what, 421?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the last one we had in May.
[SPEAKER_06]: May 23rd, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: May something-ish.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in May.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care what date it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: That day I ate a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then somebody gave me a thousand
milligram edible at that event.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ate that the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually ended up getting one of those
and I'm mad because I've been wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: like eat a thousand and I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause she ended up like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, let me, let me tell you the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave him this thousand milligram bar and
I was like, yo, surprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got you one that you've,
we've been like talking about forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does this idiot do?
[SPEAKER_04]: He opens it like, he's like, oh sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grabs the, grabs it from me, opens it up,
breaks off two of them, throws it in his
[SPEAKER_04]: mouth immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: No warning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like three bites in, he looks
over at me all wide-eyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh, why did I do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a habit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea why you did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let me just try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, why did I eat this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to eat all of this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wish I would not have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ankle weights on your brain, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: On Facebook I said it's like ankle weights
for your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so hashy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the most hashtastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: My teeth were sticking together.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were making this like.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I would pull my teeth apart,
they would make a clicking noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half pieces were really hashy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was eating it while I was driving.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hated when they were hashy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: They told me Max, what's the fucking
dude's name?
[SPEAKER_06]: Max, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: He told me he put a gram and a half of
shatter in each bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means I ate a gram and a half of
shatter in a chocolate bar that was really
[SPEAKER_06]: no bigger than an iPhone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's like six pieces or things?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's eight pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, if it's a gram and a half,
then isn't that more than a thousand?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, because that's something that we
should talk about on the podcast when we
[SPEAKER_06]: have a lot more time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a gram of hash, if you test this
hash, this is not 100% THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is probably in the high eighties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they threw a gram and a half in there
and they're calling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a much truer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they couldn't be tested by the MED
and they couldn't, they aren't an MED
[SPEAKER_06]: product.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just somebody's basement brew,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Home concoctions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss the days when anyone could use lab
testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We only had those days for about two and a
half, three months.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a beautiful chunk of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Adam and John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fuck, I totally wish I could
remember the chemist's name, the scientist
[SPEAKER_06]: that I met when I know his name.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right on the tip of my tongue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as we record a recording,
I'm going to yell his name out loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, he was a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: The scientist I met at Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: He really taught me a lot of stuff in the
short amount of time we hung out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Steep Hill is the first group,
I mean, way back at the first Kushcon,
[SPEAKER_08]: they had like the saddest little booth at
the show with the coolest information
[SPEAKER_08]: pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were the first people I really saw
breaking down cannabis testing past THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were advertising pesticides,
heavy metals, like 12 different
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabinoids at that point.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, it was one of those things
where you saw, oh, that's where the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry is going to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to open up all new avenues,
insure shit, potency jumped 20%,
[SPEAKER_08]: quality went up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, an incalculable amount right after
the lab showed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Johnny Trill and Trill
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had their shit tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero traces of any pesticides in all of
their products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, big shout out to those kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a test like that on Facebook or
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the same test I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was getting around to, I haven't
eaten edibles since that thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: milligram, cause I'm a little scared.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fell off the horse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't got back on yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I've been highly into edibles
lately, ever since I went to Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: I over roasted myself with them when I
went to see Deadpool and I've been going
[SPEAKER_08]: real light since.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just needed a reset for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just needed a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably eat a whole bunch of edibles
again at the next secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if this podcast comes out before
then.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this podcast will not be out by the
time secret sesh happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it did, we will do a review of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone looks through their phone to see
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many days until this episode?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or how many until a secret sesh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do quick math on our fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know, but check out secret
sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only way to get into a secret sesh is
to follow the instructions on the
[SPEAKER_06]: Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_06]: So either if it's already happened or not,
check out secret at secret sesh underscore
[SPEAKER_06]: CO on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you ever want to come join us,
the instructions will be posted there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow the instructions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you fuck it up, you won't get to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just a simple email.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to follow the instructions.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people do something stupidly
wrong and then like, why didn't I get my
[SPEAKER_06]: tickets?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we go look at their email,
like, cause you didn't put your name on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't show your ID like you're
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you just got to do this shit properly
and you will get in.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the secret session.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just went quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got any more useful information for
this podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have like a thousand stories I
can tell you of just obscene things people
[SPEAKER_04]: have said and done, but you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when people ridiculously blatantly
just flirt with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's, there's that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, um, when I was working in the
smoke shop, I had someone come up,
[SPEAKER_04]: come in and be like, Oh, are you the trap
queen?
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my boy sloppy for making a really
great joke on the dispensary the other
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to repeat any of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't go there, but that's fucking
golden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you listen to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard what you said.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was off.
[SPEAKER_06]: You shut up for killing it out there on
the mountain, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you were going to do something to
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Proud of you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Proud of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a youngster when he moved here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like sloppy was kind of just getting his
feet on when he moved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet you and Slop right,
like right when he like first moved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the Fung days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fung, Fung Nguyen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, Fung, I hope you listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea, but either way,
shout out to Fung Nguyen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does some art.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great art.
[SPEAKER_06]: He made me a Chewbacca torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: That Chewbacca torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that where that came from?
[SPEAKER_06]: That came from Fung Nguyen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's his sculpture, his artwork right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, I think it's time to
wrap up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody here is dab the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take some more dabs for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody dab while I start talking and
rambling so that we can hear people cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe give Mike a dab so he can cough on
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've all been staring at those turfs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon G Rude Boy, by chance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have some of the Lemon G Rude Boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is in this pile.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just got to dig through these piles of
hashes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this right here, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to snag a little piece of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, we can split this,

[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be silly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys follow all of my
friends on social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike is at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the Twitter, not the Tinder,

[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to do that again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I laughed so hard when I heard that.

[SPEAKER_04]: Green Door, I don't think I've heard of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Emily Hyde.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the one that runs, that does a lot
of stuff with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the one that introduced me to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: She gave me a bunch of tokens to get

[SPEAKER_06]: It's a token-based system.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go for that one, trust me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, trust me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't tried the, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't tried the OG Kush yet,

[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm asking, is it worth it,
or is the lemon?
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I got to try the lemon yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it, then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for the OG, but you would prefer the
lemon G.

[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.

[SPEAKER_09]: Only you alone can drench the setters.
[SPEAKER_09]: My night nurse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh the pain is getting worse.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to see no doc.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need attendance from my nurse around the
clock.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause there's no prescription for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's the one, the only remedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Night nurse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Only you alone can drench the setters.
[SPEAKER_09]: My night nurse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh the pain is getting worse.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hurt by love.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to see no doc.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need attendance from my nurse around the

[SPEAKER_09]: Oh gosh.
Oh the
[SPEAKER_06]: pain is getting worse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hurt by love.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_06]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everybody's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, this episode is packed with
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do an episode about an email
I got about making feminized seeds and
[SPEAKER_06]: selecting phenotypes for seeds and seed
breeding and feminized seed making.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one was right up my alley,
so I took a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be a great episode in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we get that far, let's talk
about the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, the secret sesh was just a few
days ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my opinion, this was the best
secret sesh we've done in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the secret sesh on 421,
the day after 420, that was pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was the day after 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a lot of really cool people in
town that wouldn't normally be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a lot of extra hype because of the
420 weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of extra momentum.
[SPEAKER_06]: That really helped us out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little over-hyped and too big for
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like a smaller, more intimate event.
[SPEAKER_06]: So without all the hustle and bustle,
this was my favorite secret sesh,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were plenty of people there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The place was packed, but it was a little
more intimate.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was more room to dab, more room to
chill out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little quieter.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could go get some quiet space and talk
to some people if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So huge shout out to the Grimy Gatsby for
throwing a stellar event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Miles for putting it
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to everybody who
participated in this secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go down a little bit of a
list here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Terps from Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big huge shout out to my buddy Brad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad, Mary's motivation on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you follow him.
[SPEAKER_06]: That dude showed up with a pocket full of
Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody said something.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy Bobo said something to Brad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Brad goes, so you want some Terps?
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course Bobo was like, well,
of course I want some Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he threw him a canister filled with
little Terp containers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Bobo's eyes lit up like a child at
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just happened to have a bunch of
packs of seeds in my pocket that I was
[SPEAKER_06]: going to give to some friends to grow out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since I saw that beautiful gift given
right there, I decided to return some
[SPEAKER_06]: karma and I passed some seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brett's way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Brett's got some iry genetic seeds in
his garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be growing those out before too long
and we'll talk about those on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big huge shout out to the Terpy boy,
Brett.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brett hooks it up with the Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just got us dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had some super good flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody at the event had good flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to our friends at the Terp
Suite.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those kids always bring the flame.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good to see Diamond Dave at the
event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave, I don't know if you listened to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good to shake your hand and see
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't seen you in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just seemed like we weren't getting along
on Facebook for some reason, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's good to shake your hand and
fucking put that behind us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome back to the crew, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Lindsey and Chris for
letting me kind of tag along to be their
[SPEAKER_06]: third wheel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun hanging out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get Lindsey on another episode
because I've got something I want to talk
[SPEAKER_06]: to her about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll talk about sending stickers
to all you people that we owe stickers to.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not forget, Mike and Lindsey and I
talked about it via text message.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we owe you guys some stickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fred, your stickers are coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple other people, you got stickers
coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that participated in the mullet
challenge, you do have stickers coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not forget about you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that hit up hashtag,
I like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got stickers coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody forgot about you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just dabbed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're blazing and confused.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing what we can to keep up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So back on track here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Adam Mill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam Mill comes all the way from
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: He flies in from Burbank all the way to
Colorado here to host the secret session
[SPEAKER_06]: with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big shout out to my boy, Adam Mill.
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know about Adam Mill,
make sure you follow him.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at Adam Bluntz, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he always has to change his social
media.
[SPEAKER_06]: They always shut down his social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has to restart new shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Search Adam Mill on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Adam Bluntz on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the hostess with the mostess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, big shout out to my buddy Giddy Up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen Giddy Up in a while,
and Giddy Up was at the secret sesh
[SPEAKER_06]: rocking a mohawk, building a stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great dude, that Giddy Up guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys support Emotech.
[SPEAKER_06]: That dude just moved to Hollywood,
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's young and rich and lives in Kelly
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck with that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope things go well for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big huge shout out to my buddy,
Jason Margulies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I missed your lovely lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have been good to see her and
give her a high five and a half hug.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, those one-armed hugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been good to see her, but it's good
seeing you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time, bring the lady with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll all hang out, take some terpy dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's all the shout outs I've got
for the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I turned down edibles this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not eat any edibles at the secret
sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to TNT Extrax.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me some 200-milligram bacon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he handed me bacon wrapped in
parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, hmm, okay then.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I walked away and acted like I was
going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, I gave that to our buddy
Bobo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Bobo Blastroco.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the edibles I was given that night,
I passed them right over to Bobo.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the sesh, people will just walk by you
and hand you edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, here, you need some edibles,
bro, and I will take them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then if I'm not on the edible zone
that night, I just pass them on to
[SPEAKER_06]: friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobo got all of my excess edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was lit up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm afraid, you guys, I ate a bunch of
edibles at the last secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ate, I don't even know, a lot of
edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a lot of THC in my body.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to guess somewhere between 800
and 1,500 milligrams of THC in my body.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was challenged.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was having a rough time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then our friends at TNT Extrax gave me
a 1,000-milligram edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ate it for breakfast the next day on
my way home.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time I got to work,
it felt like I had wrapped a vice around
[SPEAKER_06]: my brain, and I was trying to function on
half speed all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been afraid of edibles since then,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't eaten any.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been quite a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I'll do it for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably go see fish and eat a couple
hundred milligrams of the fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be what has to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, let's get to the
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_06]: The point of this podcast, I received an
email from a friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me open up this email.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got it saved right here on the phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: This dude signed his name.
[SPEAKER_06]: As just a noob trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he called himself Ben.
[SPEAKER_06]: So noob trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: This question was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You asked a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you really sparked a great podcast,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me read the email.
[SPEAKER_06]: The email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Greetings, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, I want to say thank you for the
Kick Ass podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that you have taught me so much in
these weekly sessions.
[SPEAKER_06]: They make my Monday morning commute
tolerable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that's why I put them out Monday
morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your weekend doesn't, or so your week
doesn't have to start with a shitty
[SPEAKER_06]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_06]: You start off with some Kick Ass podcast
material.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you noticed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for checking it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he goes on to say, Dude, your question
is not stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so excited when I read this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Oh, I know a lot about this
and I'm going to get to ramble on for a
[SPEAKER_06]: long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to continue with email.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says,
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I encourage everybody,
every time you grow a seed, every time it
[SPEAKER_06]: gets big enough to take a clone,
you take a clone off of it before you
[SPEAKER_06]: flower it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you don't know if that seed is
going to bear the most amazing cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: you have ever smoked in your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't have a clone of it,
you might try to kick yourself in the ass
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're going to be kind of mad about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's heartbreaking when you don't get a
cut of this super amazing herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew some, excuse me for the throat
clearing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, that's a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew some Holy Grail Kush from DNA
Genetics and it was honestly superb
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can get your hands on some Holy
Grail Kush seeds, I recommend that from
[SPEAKER_06]: another breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not even my brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be a Reserva Pravada project by
now, but Holy Grail Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the real deal, the old school shit
from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not get, the phenotype I selected
would not make clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would not root for shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put them in Rockwool, they shriveled up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put them in a cloner, they got funky and
fell apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not get that shit to clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll never get to taste that flavor again.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend Pops is an old guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says that was one of the top five best
pots he's ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Pops is an old dude and hard to
impress.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Holy Grail Kush was some special
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not get it to root.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I had a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite strains ever was the
P91.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were some serious raids of large
grow facilities and the P91 rumor has it
[SPEAKER_06]: was lost in that raid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody claims to have it, but I really
don't know if that is what they have got.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody can claim to have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about something else you
said in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems that the strains are named for a
special phenotypically expressed trait.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why the Sour Diesel is called Sour
Diesel because it smells like diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they tried to name the Girl Scout
cookies that because they wanted us to
[SPEAKER_06]: think that it tastes like Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit, they call it the Thin
Mint cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get the Thin Mint, it tastes the
Thin Mint cookies and the Thin Mint cut,
[SPEAKER_06]: it could be close.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that part is totally accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now here's what I really like to get into
in this part of the email.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, if the traits are passed from
mother to clone, would it be likely that
[SPEAKER_06]: the same traits would be present in nearly
100% of the seeds if you were to make
[SPEAKER_06]: feminized seeds from this plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: You would hope so because of logic,
but that is not accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I took a bunch of notes and I'll get
into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to take a break here in
a second, take a drink, but let me keep
[SPEAKER_06]: reading the email and then I'll take a
drink, take a quick break, just because
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys don't want to hear me clear my
throat a thousand more times.
[SPEAKER_06]: The email goes on to say, my logic may be
way off on this as I am not a botanist or
[SPEAKER_06]: geneticist, but if it does play out like
this, then why don't the seed companies
[SPEAKER_06]: grow out several plants to find that rare
phenotype and then make feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: from that plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: Any knowledge you can drop will be greatly
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks bro, from Justin Noob trying to
learn, then he signs it, Ben.
[SPEAKER_06]: Noob, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to press pause for just a second
here, take a drink and then I'll be right
[SPEAKER_06]: back.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, I'm back,
took a big fresh drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I'm better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be better for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a dab and fuck it all up
again, but I'm better for now.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get back to this email.
[SPEAKER_06]: The part that got my attention here at the
end said, if the traits are passed from
[SPEAKER_06]: mother to clone, would it be likely that
the same traits would be present in nearly
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% of the seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now a clone you're taking a cutting from
an existing plant and that plant is making
[SPEAKER_06]: a root of course, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're getting a clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the traits are passed because there
was no opportunity for any other
[SPEAKER_06]: chromosomes or genetics or traits to be
introduced into that cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing, you're not going to pull
DNA out of the air to change the traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, that one will be exactly like the
mother that it came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we're working with seeds,
we have the opportunity for variation
[SPEAKER_06]: because we're using pollen that has
chromosomes from the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not only getting parents,
not only getting chromosomes from that
[SPEAKER_06]: selected phenotype, but you're getting
chromosomes from whatever that plant is a
[SPEAKER_06]: cross-up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that I want to mention,
we do search for those selected phenotypes
[SPEAKER_06]: that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now I'm making a rise F2s,
which means I made in a rise strain,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I took Daybreaker as the male and I
put Daybreaker pollen on a golden goat
[SPEAKER_06]: female and I took those seeds and what
came out of that, I named that a rise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've found a beautiful male.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a studly male.
[SPEAKER_06]: He produces the structure I want,
the aroma I want.
[SPEAKER_06]: He makes resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: This male plant is a stud.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've got, I think right now I've
got three or four gorgeous arise females
[SPEAKER_06]: that I need to pick one of those because I
want to take that arise male and I want to
[SPEAKER_06]: put that pollen on that arise female and
make arise F2s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm doing that by selecting the
perfect phenotype of the perfect male and
[SPEAKER_06]: the perfect female to bring out the traits
that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I could screw that all up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could bring out a bunch of recessive
traits and it could be a total disaster
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'll have to go back and find a
different male and female and do it all
[SPEAKER_06]: over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why I grow out a bunch of them
myself before I try to sell them or give
[SPEAKER_06]: them away to anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I make sure to grow out probably a hundred
of those by myself before anybody else
[SPEAKER_06]: will even see them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do look for those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We find those perfect phenotypes and
sometimes a cross will be made that wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: intended to smell like something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that Tangy, I don't think
that the guy that made Tangy, I think that
[SPEAKER_06]: was Crockett.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Crockett was like,
I want to make Tangy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Tangy should be Cali O and this,
whatever the hell he used.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this orange plant, I don't think he
was like, I want to make Tangy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he crossed some shit and it came
out and tastes like Tangerines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, that's that Tangy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's how that came.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anybody was like,
I want to make a strain that tastes like
[SPEAKER_06]: diesel feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was actually named because of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they select that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's talk about something else you
said, why don't we use those selected
[SPEAKER_06]: phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_06]: We do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if I'm going to make feminine
seeds from that selected phenotype,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to treat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to take two clones of the
same plant, the selected phenotype that
[SPEAKER_06]: has the traits that we like, the one that,
so we'll say Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've made feminine seeds of Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've grown a bunch of my own Grateful Dog
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I found the one that is stellar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I take two clones of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I reverse one and I put that reversed
pollen onto the female Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I make Grateful Dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now sometimes those Grateful Dog seeds
look like Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes those Grateful Dog seeds
look a little bit more like San Fernando
[SPEAKER_06]: Valley OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of them look very much like the
Grateful Dog clone that I reversed and
[SPEAKER_06]: started with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll get a little, a little bit
of variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a little closer to the chem,
but more OG and then a little more OG,
[SPEAKER_06]: but closer to the chem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you'll see blends of the traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like making kids,
you know, like your sister might look a
[SPEAKER_06]: little different from you, but you could
definitely tell you're from the same gene
[SPEAKER_06]: pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to vary a little bit more
from, so you're going to see traits of
[SPEAKER_06]: grandma is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to see traits of grandpa is
what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes you might see great
grandparent traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me refer back to my notes here to
keep myself on topic because I'm getting
[SPEAKER_06]: way, way off of what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do search for those phenotypes and
that's how we make our F2s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we do reverse those to make our
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I breed with my second and third
generations from those select,
[SPEAKER_06]: I make my second and third generations
from those selected plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was talking about picking one female
and one female, something else,
[SPEAKER_06]: or one male and one female, something else
I also do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will take multiple females of the same
strain and one male of that strain and hit
[SPEAKER_06]: three or four different females with that
male pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way I've got, I can see the
variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that this girl produces more
resinous offspring.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that this girl produces tall and
lanky offspring.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want to breed to that one
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go ahead and get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that this one over here produces
really lanky plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stink really well, but don't make a
lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe I don't want to breed to that
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll go and hit multiple females.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way I can find the best breeding
plants that I can use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll also hit different females of
different strains in that room with that
[SPEAKER_06]: male.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll put four females.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I do this Arise F2, it's about to
happen pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably put two, maybe three females
of Arise in there to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm going to probably put seven
or eight, maybe nine or 10 females of
[SPEAKER_06]: other strains in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a grateful dog in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put a golden goat in there to
take it backwards a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some other stuff that's going to
go in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some crosses I made that'll go in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'm going to hit all of those with
pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll see what comes of all of
that progeny.
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a whole bunch of great stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, my logic may be way off on this,
but I'm not a botanist or geneticist,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I like.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, but if it does play out like
this, then why don't the seed companies
[SPEAKER_06]: grow out several plants to find the rare
phenotypes and then make feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: from that plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's kind of exactly it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what they slash we do,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I explained that in a way that
makes a lot of sense to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I want to go back over is the
word phenotype.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear a lot of people say phenome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pheno, P-H-E-N-O, phenotype,
phenotypical expression, pheno,
[SPEAKER_06]: not phenome, just to make you sound cooler
in your circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're making seeds and those
seeds do come out, of course, variation is
[SPEAKER_06]: natural.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that we expect.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't control it completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to make something that I did
that I didn't even realize I was doing
[SPEAKER_06]: something out of the norm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made feminized seeds, and then I found
my favorite phenotype out of that batch of
[SPEAKER_06]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I hit that feminized plant with the
original pollen that I made feminized
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds from, and the progeny from that was
super stable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it again, and then I tried to
reverse one of those plants, and I could
[SPEAKER_06]: not get it to reverse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not make the plant herm.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could not change the sex of that plant
to make more feminized seeds with that
[SPEAKER_06]: generation of that progeny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was super impressed with the stability
of that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: That plant is still around.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been named GD77.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people ask me about my naming
schemes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very random.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grateful Dog was GD.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1977 is one of my favorite years of the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: So GD77, it's the Grateful Dead 77 pheno.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the mother room right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of my favorite keepers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've probably had that one for,
I don't even know how long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really can't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had it for a super long time,
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say eight years I've had that clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Variation is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're making seeds, I like
variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want every seed to grow out just
like the picture on the package because
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone's got that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a little bit of variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that the grower down the street
that bought those seeds doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_06]: phenotype that I've got, and that means
that there might be something better in
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means you can always keep growing
more seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I always, that's why I love
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might find something better than what
you've already got.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes when somebody loses a plant or
if something doesn't root when you try to
[SPEAKER_06]: clone it, I always look at the bright
side.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means I get to grow more seeds
because seeds are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds have vigor.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find new shit in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every strain that you're smoking,
every clone that you've ever grown,
[SPEAKER_06]: that came from a seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had to.
[SPEAKER_06]: The variation, of course, you could
stabilize that just by breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make F2s, make F3s.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time you get to F5, those seeds
will be super stable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll start making seeds that produce
almost clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you get to the F6 generation,
probably 90% of the seeds that you plant
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to look just like the picture on
the package if the breeder did it
[SPEAKER_06]: properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, I'm going to take a
dab and a drink and I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_06]: another email to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I do that, I want to give a big
shout out to our buddy, the noob that sent
[SPEAKER_06]: us this email.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like talking about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like talking about making seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like talking about breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some of my favorite shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have more questions about that,
send them to me,
[SPEAKER_06]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will read your emails on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, I need a drink and a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Play some reggae music and you can hang
out for a second.
[SPEAKER_12]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_12]: He said Babylon ain't feeling good,
damn.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_12]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I got problem, I talk
domestically.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my girl, she does.
[SPEAKER_12]: One who called me, I smoke the marijuana
and get high.
[SPEAKER_12]: Stay above the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I am back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Took a drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did not take some dabs this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have a voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think my throat is going to hold up for
at least a couple more emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get to another email.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one says, Rasta J, recently
discovered my latest batch of girls are
[SPEAKER_06]: not as innocent as I would like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they are flat ass full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question for you is if there are any
dead giveaways to determine if they were
[SPEAKER_06]: pollinated or simply hermed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have a sneaky mail get by me until
about week three.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had him labeled wrong and stuck him in
the flower room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping this is the case and not a herm
issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he continues to give me reasons why
his plants may have hermed and duty out of
[SPEAKER_06]: mail.
[SPEAKER_06]: He fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a boy in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That mail at three weeks, he busted a nut.
[SPEAKER_06]: He pollinated your girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what that mail was?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my question now.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know what that mail plant was,
you may have accidentally just bred some
[SPEAKER_06]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep those seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: See what you got.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that mail
dropped pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It only takes about 14 days for some of
those studlier males to just start blowing
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had him in there until about week
three, I'm pretty sure that's who hit
[SPEAKER_06]: those girls with pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the list of things you mentioned that
may be reasons why those plants hermed,
[SPEAKER_06]: it does not look likely to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: The recent switch of lighting that would
not do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The slight foxtailing you mentioned,
that's because they got too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that made them herm.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a dude in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, when you have mail, if you were
growing from seed or if you have a mail
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, I have mails in my stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a couple of big fat mail arise
plants in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got Solomon just chilling.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's kicking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing from seed and you got
boy plants, those boy plants will drop
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually got a strawberry tangy
banana mail plant in a very small pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see mail flower clusters forming on
the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't get that out of there in the
next 10 days, he will drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That pollen will come from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing from seed, keep an eye
on those pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't want seeded plants,
if you don't want pollen, don't be lazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get those mails out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: This dude's a perfect example of why you
don't want to have mails in your garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got seeds now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That brings me to something I've wanted to
say for a little while and haven't had the
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're running a garden and there's
some shit that needs to be done,
[SPEAKER_06]: do it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why wait?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your love.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your product.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing for commercial,
if you're growing for medicinal,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're growing just for love,
do that shit today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those plants are alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your dog was hungry and your dog needed
water, you wouldn't make the dog wait till
[SPEAKER_06]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you make the plants wait?
[SPEAKER_06]: Love those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to care for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that needs to be done in the
grove, if that bulb is dirty, or if that
[SPEAKER_06]: bulb is dead, that lens is dirty,
if that ducting is funky, don't do that
[SPEAKER_06]: shit tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do that shit today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be a lazy bitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clean your garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care of that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That garden, that crop is only going to be
in flower for 63 days, 56, 63,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe 70 days if you're going hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not make every day count?
[SPEAKER_06]: Get in there and do that shit right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put some love into those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll quit bitching at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I kind of got on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just love your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys get in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care of that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You claim to love your garden,
go love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got another message I want to read.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember a few episodes ago, we had a
listener send an email asking about
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendations for dispensaries in
Denver, and I took a screenshot of his
[SPEAKER_06]: latest message.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sent me this message on Instagram,
and it says, Rasta Jeff, wanted to thank
[SPEAKER_06]: you for reading my email on your podcast
and for recommending Natty Rams.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife and I loved our trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to let you know that Stitcher has
all of your episodes starting at episode
[SPEAKER_06]: 40, all the way to the current episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep those beautiful Instagram images
coming from our friend Fats.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great message to read.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I'm glad you enjoyed Natty Rams.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad Colorado was super kind to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that you and your wife had a
great trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also glad to hear that all of the
episodes starting at episode 40 are on
[SPEAKER_06]: Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that everybody can listen all
the way back to episode 40.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably 44-ish by now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 45 by the time this comes out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means they're going to keep 100
episodes on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are 100 episodes of this podcast
available on Stitcher, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go listen to 100 episodes
of the show, I encourage you to go back
[SPEAKER_06]: and listen to old episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorites, I think, is the
scheduling your perpetual grow episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: That episode, that should have been a
million dollar book idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you listen to that one for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't heard that one,
go listen to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's number 72.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be a responsible podcast host
and press pause and go make sure what
[SPEAKER_06]: number that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I found the information I wanted to find,
but I want to let you guys know something
[SPEAKER_06]: funny that I just did.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy John Hunt gave me a pencil
dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is made out of green stardust glass,
and it's got some colored tips and a
[SPEAKER_06]: colored eraser end, or a colored tip where
the pencil end would be.
[SPEAKER_06]: The colored tip where the eraser end would
be.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's made out of glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's meant to be used as a dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: My high ass just picked it up and tried to
write a fucking note on my notepad with
[SPEAKER_06]: the dabber pencil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Cannabis and THC for that
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, the episode I was actually
referring to is number 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check out episode number 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's scheduling a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that episode should have been
a million dollar episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: While we're going through it, check out
number 76 about pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then if you want to learn about Outdoor,
our friend Jesse comes by episode number
[SPEAKER_06]: 79.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely go back and check out 73.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 55 is one of my favorite episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're new to the podcast, make sure
you check out 55.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've thought about going back and
releasing some of the older episodes on a
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday, like a midweek episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe once some of those older episodes
fall out of the feed, once I put so many
[SPEAKER_06]: episodes in that there's like 50 more that
I can repost.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go back and put those up on a
Thursday or something so that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: still in the feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys can listen to them because there
are some great episodes that need to stay
[SPEAKER_06]: up for a little longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get the show back on
track.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, big shout out to our friend
Fats.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do appreciate the interaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, next time you're in Colorado,
give me a heads up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get together.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll smoke some turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take some selfies.

[SPEAKER_06]: And I will also talk about how to set your
email to the appropriate temp for your
[SPEAKER_06]: liking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody sent me a question about my dream
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to kind of talk about that on an
upcoming episode.

question from a listener.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got an episode about identifying
issues in your garden.

[SPEAKER_06]: face.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a little glazed, folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike's like, let's get really high for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: And nobody in the room argued that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone was like, I like this idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody jumped right on that idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a little roasted.
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that as soon as I hit play on
the opening track, I wanted to cop real
[SPEAKER_06]: hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So getting through that intro was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was proud of myself.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of dabbing, this episode is going
to be a lot about dabbing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: But coming up in a future episode,
it has been confirmed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to have the wonderful,
the Miss Dabbing Granny on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you know about the Dabbing Granny,
stay tuned for a future episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: She will be joining us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if I'm going to her,
if she's coming to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay, can you tell us a little bit
about your friend, the Dabbing Granny?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Gail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dropping the real name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Name dropping like you're the homie now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just kick it with Gail.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are so... Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's how this is going to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, Dabbing Granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabbing Granny and I met in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have hung out at Canna Canyon
a couple of times and gotten to take some
[SPEAKER_04]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got to hang out with Brett,
Mary's motivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually left work for lunch for 30
minutes and got to go over to Canna
[SPEAKER_04]: Canyon, hang out with her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brett, THC Sam, THC Magazine, Sam,
and a couple others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people, Chandler and a couple other
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was super fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, she's just big on social media
because everybody wants to follow a
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabbing Granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Dabbing Granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, she listens to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you told me that she listens to the
podcast, you put the biggest smile on my
[SPEAKER_06]: face.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually you have Brett to thank for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, I mean, like I was just sitting
there, but we were...
[SPEAKER_04]: Brett and I were talking about the podcast
at Canna Canyon that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Granny was like, what podcast is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brett said, give me your phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he took the phone from her and he
subscribed her to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she turns to me and she said,
you're on this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I'm very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, Jeff has me on the podcast way
more than I should be on her.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fortunate to have you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a mutual thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she started listening to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess one of the first couple of
ones that... I don't know what the first
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of ones she listens to actually
were, but she listened to the dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: talk one with the three of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she commented on something and she was
like, oh, was it me that you were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about flirting with you in the dispensary?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of people might know who we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys check out the Dabbing Granny on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I discovered her, she took a giant
dab, like a big dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: She took like a hundred of my dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time I saw the video,
I felt so bad about the size of my dab for
[SPEAKER_08]: like the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a little young to be my granny,
but she could be Lindsay's granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: She could definitely be your granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's a granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not being derogatory calling her
granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a damn granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her Instagram handle is dabbing underscore
granny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's... And I'm pretty sure
it's the Dabbing Granny on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know about her YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think that's where she shouted out
your thing.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for the shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dabbing Granny, Granny, Gail, whatever I'm
supposed to call you, Granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to go with granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she takes a giant dab off of a rig and
then she chugs a beer, like a whole pint
[SPEAKER_06]: glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she takes a shot and then she
blows out her dab and takes another dab
[SPEAKER_06]: from the nectar collector and smiles into
the camera like that's how you do it,
[SPEAKER_06]: bitches.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then ends the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually like one of her staple
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: She kind of like changes it around a
little bit, but like I'm pretty sure she
[SPEAKER_04]: did that on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Live today or some version of that,
you know, like a dab, a beer, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: like a shot and then something,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a bong rip or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think she does some sort of variation
and that's her like, I think she calls it
[SPEAKER_04]: her party trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really could be wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's, I think that's where she
really... It's her version of the strike
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's impressive as all how the first time
I've watched the video, it caught my eye
[SPEAKER_08]: because it was someone who could be my
grandmother with the dab lined up that was
[SPEAKER_08]: like, I mean, it was YouTube dab worthy
size.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was massive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a dab I would be proud to take.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe half a gram, three quarters of a
gram.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then she takes this dab like a champ.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I'm sitting there like,
wow, she like throws down a pint and then
[SPEAKER_08]: does a bong rip and then exhales the bong
rip and the dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm looking at this video and my mind
just shocked.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I've seen, I was instantly a fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I bet a lot of people, her YouTube,
her Facebook, her Instagram, it's just
[SPEAKER_06]: exploding as people listen to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys go support Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Granny, we're going to get you on the
podcast really soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look forward to that in a future episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a cannabis advocate.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a smoker, but she's a savage.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my favorite part about her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: She seems to be super sweet from
everything I've seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Granny, can't wait to have you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay, thanks for arranging that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said blame Brett.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brett, thanks for arranging that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys go ahead, Granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't reach out to her.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got her listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: You brought her here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your guys' fault.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I love about the idea of
places like Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the community doesn't have any good
place to meet up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as soon as we started getting them
really cool connections started being
[SPEAKER_08]: made.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got something to say ladies first.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you said fault, I thought you like,
I thought you were meaning it in a
[SPEAKER_04]: negative way and you're like, Lindsay,
that's your fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, well.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I was picking on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And something else Lindsay said that I
really liked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brett, right on for just grabbing
someone's phone and subscribing them to my
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just do that more frequently is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get my phone and be like, here,
you're subscribed to Ross to Jeff's
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen his Instagram lives?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like his snap, the new Instagram Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been in tears.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one he ever put up was like by
Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was this like he's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next one was just something
like, oh my God, I'm so excited about
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer all your questions now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes like down and then he comes
back up and he's like, I am in my
[SPEAKER_04]: underwear right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just cuts off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, yes, these are going
to be so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: That dude's a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Brett.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the turp love.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys want to talk about that new,
stupid Instagram feature?
[SPEAKER_06]: Want to just give it a second?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new feature on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I care or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason I don't give out my Instagram
is because I don't even use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I've I only open it when it says I
have a bunch of notifications and I only
[SPEAKER_08]: open it to clear the notifications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just feels like it never ends.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just so many pictures that scroll
by.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I don't even care.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot that I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what you have to remember is that
Instagram was originally just pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how far Instagram has actually
evolved and what it actually started from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you really hate them for doing a live
feature?
[SPEAKER_06]: For trying to be Snapchat?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have pros and cons about it,
so I just don't really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel like they're trying to suck up
too much of my attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I can scroll up and down and left and
right and it just fucks me all up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no end to it now because I'm just
like, oh, that's enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since we're talking about social media,
this is a good segue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter people, I've got three names of
folks that I have got envelopes with your
[SPEAKER_06]: name written on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a stamp on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a return address label on there
that someone claimed was mediocre,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think it's just fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to work just fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a return address label on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that gets lost, it will get back to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get it back to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you that receive these,
feel free to comment about the quality of
[SPEAKER_06]: the labels on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd love to hear your comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be stickers in there for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are to say thank you for
participating in Twitter challenges or
[SPEAKER_06]: just for being a friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys want some stickers,
contact me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit me up on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit me up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit me up on the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can email me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's growing from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: The real trick is to listen to the whole
episode when it's a longer one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that does help out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That pays off.
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, if you follow me on Twitter
or Instagram or something, send me a
[SPEAKER_06]: message.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instagram is Iri.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you used to be following me,
you might not now because a long time ago
[SPEAKER_06]: they crushed my account and I've started a
new account.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had like almost 20,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm only around six or 7,000 now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So come follow me again, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: On Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: On Facebook, it's Grow From Your Heart
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, there's the email that I
like to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go search for me there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find me, email me, contact me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you some stickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these friends of mine are going to get
some stickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to James Howlett.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get some stickers in the
mail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason Hawkins, you got stickers coming in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sammy, bro, you got some stickers
coming in the mail, bro, my painted chef
[SPEAKER_06]: friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also that segue is right into the next
part.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you guys like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Double segue.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing a Grateful Dead style.
[SPEAKER_06]: One right into the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep on jamming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sammy asked about easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_06]: His basic question was, do you recommend
an easy cloner?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you like an easy cloner?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I love an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I really like about an easy cloner is
you can cut large clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take big clones, they'll root
quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those big clones, I think they take
off much more quickly than clones in
[SPEAKER_06]: rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike remembers my old school days of
trying to cut clones in rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took so many clones and put them in
rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did that for a lot of years with a lot
of different growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike used to be a grow hand for everybody
around here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, the easy cloner is a huge step
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: In my mind, if you're growing and cloning
regularly, it's worth the investment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just make sure you get a good one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember your first easy cloner,
bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's not talk too much about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but two seconds after you
had plugged it in, your advice would have
[SPEAKER_08]: been, don't buy one that crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, those old ones sucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new models are awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they worked out all the kinks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't explode and turn your grow room
into a water park anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best description.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are new models.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new easy cloners, the low,
what do they call them?
[SPEAKER_06]: The low rise, the low profile models.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're white now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really dig them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They require less water, which is really
helpful because that also means less
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm only familiar with the big black
beast, but it gets the double thumbs up
from me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same thing, but just a new
design.
[SPEAKER_06]: They used to leak.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember how the old black ones used to
spray out of the sides?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit, they drip a little.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't leak or drip anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new design is way better.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're easier to clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like the new easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sammy, if you're looking to up your
clone game, get yourself an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is super easy to use that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a healthy mother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, get your cloner set up.
[SPEAKER_06]: By that I mean, get the cloner fucking
built.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the neoprens in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the little manifold in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it spraying, get it running.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fill it up with water just below those red
sprayers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember how much water you put in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Figure that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would use a little bit of bloom,
like your base bloom nutrient,
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit of micro, and just dip them
in some... I like to use the easy cloner
[SPEAKER_06]: gel.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that one called?
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, I can't think of the name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clonex.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a purple clonex gel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to use that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dip it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it in the little neoprene collar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cut it to where there's like two or three
nodes underneath that collar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that shit in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the cloner on for 45 minutes on,
15 minutes off because that water will
[SPEAKER_06]: heat up because of that pump.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put a T5 light about a foot above that and
just let the T5 light run 24 hours a day
[SPEAKER_06]: and no shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: In like seven or eight days, you'll start
seeing little warts pop out of the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's where the roots are going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 10 to 14 days, you'll have savage
roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 17 to 21 days, those roots are going to
be so big, you'll have to go to a three
[SPEAKER_06]: gallon pot and skip a cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: A huge step up in technology from the old
school clone domes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Huge step up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I highly, highly recommend those.
[SPEAKER_06]: We use those at The Grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I run a big commercial grow and I've got
one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are six easy cloners filled with
clones right now at The Grow and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: how we keep it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could go on like this about the cloner
for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really an awesome product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'd like to send me some easy
cloners, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's moving me hard at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could just use like 160 site or 190
site.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just my personal setup.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need anything for the store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just send me one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sammy, I hope I answered your question,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's not too late.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that took me a while to get to that
message.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do one episode a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to fix that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did two a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could probably get more questions
answered, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay, you all right over there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Headphones all right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my ear.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get headphone ear?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have a- You have a ear?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a ear?
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even worth it tonight,
I don't feel like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of late at night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay's real high, so picking on her is
way too simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a bad episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got getting fried to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike just segwayed us right in again.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's jamming us right into the next topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the last episode, we talked a lot about
dabbing and stuff and I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: email temperature and getting your email
set to the temperature that is perfect for
[SPEAKER_06]: you because I like my email a little bit
hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: If Spence was here, Spence from Garden of
Weed, and shout out to my brother Spence,
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would crack me up every time he did
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spence would reach right over and just
turn my email down like, motherfucker,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would just turn it down like he owned
that bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: It lightly scold you for having it too
hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you know, it's my email and I
like them hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although it was just a beautiful thing to
watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty funny, but I just let Spence
do his thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a hash maker and he would bring over
slabs and dab me out with them and you
[SPEAKER_06]: could make it whatever temp you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to drop that much hash on
there, do your thing, player.
[SPEAKER_06]: But most people keep their emails a little
lower than I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like mine a little hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody was asking me, how do I get my
email to the perfect temperature?
[SPEAKER_06]: The temperature is all kind of subjective.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about, do you want it hot and
hurty?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want it low temp, all taste?
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the new trend is to heat a nail
and this is not the email.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is if you're using like a banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new trend is to heat the nail,
let it get way too hot and then let it
[SPEAKER_06]: cool way down and then put your dab on
there and waste half the fucking dab and
[SPEAKER_06]: then act like it tasted real good and then
get a Q-tip and clean it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what all the trendy kids are doing
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you see at all the events.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not my style.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to heat it and when it's hot enough
to cook the dab, I drop a real big dab on
[SPEAKER_06]: it and make sure it all cooks and I get a
big thick, fat milky hit that makes my
[SPEAKER_06]: eyes water and makes my lungs kind of
twitter a little bit and I put a carb cap
[SPEAKER_06]: on it and make it even fatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like to get a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So setting the email to the perfect temp
is kind of subjective for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way I would say to do it and use a
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely use a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually went and googled a part about a
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about a carb cap for a second
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This actually comes from High Times
Magazine and it was written, I wrote it
[SPEAKER_06]: down, it's written by Sean Black.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says like this, the carb cap is exactly
what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_06]: A carburetor for your rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: It restricts.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck does that word mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It restricts the amount of airflow to your
nail allowing you to collect the last bits
[SPEAKER_06]: of your oil to punctuate the end of your
hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the part that's important.
[SPEAKER_06]: By capping the nail, you restrict the
airflow into the rig through the small
[SPEAKER_06]: contact area between the cap and the edge
of the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: While inhaling strongly, the reduced
airflow places the entire rig under low
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure, including the oil that pulled on
the nail without vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Under low pressure, every component of the
hash oil suddenly has a lower boiling
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: What once boiled, it should say which,
which once boiled at high temperatures can
[SPEAKER_06]: now do so at much lower temperatures,
giving you a bloom of thicker,
[SPEAKER_06]: better, tasting smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: The carb cap lets you actually finish the
dab instead of wasting it in a thick,
[SPEAKER_06]: sputtering puddle.
[SPEAKER_06]: The trend now, you guys, is that thick,
sputtering puddle because everyone wants
[SPEAKER_06]: to taste the Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps is the new word.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps is the new thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that carb cap description there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get your email, you guys set it too
hot, set it too low.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go one direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: I recommend just slowly climb up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're looking for the sweet spot in
between wasting a lot of your product and
[SPEAKER_08]: burning the living fuck out of your
throat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I did to myself last night.
[SPEAKER_06]: How far away right now is my finger from
the top of that nail?
[SPEAKER_06]: Inch and a half.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: So put your fingers an inch to two inches
above the nail and it should be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: sit there comfortably for like one or two
seconds before like, Ooh, that's hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should feel like your fingers getting
pinched.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like someone's just pinching your finger a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about the right temperature where I
like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you agree?
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of feels like you're getting pinched
after a couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_08]: See the toy that I should have now that I
don't is a laser tap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I've got one of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one at home too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's literally I've left the house with
money in my pocket to go buy one a couple
[SPEAKER_08]: of times and something happens and I ended
up at home without one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not in the cards because it's
not necessary.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just something I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to remind me of this
conversation in a much sober.
[SPEAKER_06]: Magic just happened here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on what kind of hash you're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if you're smoking shatter like this
shatter, you can put it on there kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I had some wax, it'd probably go
hotter.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I smoke in live res, I might turn it
down just a bit to get more of that taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it depends on the concentrate you've
got.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys get the concentrate that you've
got, get the nails set a little bit low,
[SPEAKER_06]: put the dab on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it doesn't put the carb cap on,
start smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that dab doesn't melt enough,
obviously turn that shit up and just go
[SPEAKER_06]: five or 10 degrees higher every time until
you get the dab you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't recommend the carb cap enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time you use one, when you throw
it on top of the nail, the first thing
[SPEAKER_08]: that goes through your head is where'd all
that come from?
[SPEAKER_08]: As you watch the vapor going through your
rig quadruple and thicken because that
[SPEAKER_08]: wasn't on your nail a second ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had you taken a breath and hit it,
you wouldn't have gotten any of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And suddenly you've got a huge milked out
rig going for you again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love just when you cap it and you just
see it and you just start pulling like,
[SPEAKER_06]: ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's part of the reason I've been so
baked the last couple of shows I've done
[SPEAKER_08]: is because I didn't have one at home for
the last several months and was not
[SPEAKER_08]: getting nearly as stoned at home because I
didn't have all the tools with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you drop the carb cap on there,
you guys, you're pulling your hit,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're taking your hit, and then you get
enough smoke to fill your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to blow out so that you could
pull the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't take the carb cap off because at
that time you're letting all that vapor
[SPEAKER_06]: and that pressure and that vacuum that
you've created, you've just ruined that by
[SPEAKER_06]: letting the carb cap off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave that carb cap on there almost until
you're done dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's a good idea to lift it
because that fucker gets hot, but just put
[SPEAKER_06]: it on there, inhale, blow your head out,
leave the cap on, inhale the rest and then
[SPEAKER_06]: take it off as soon as you're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't take it off until you're done
dabbing because a lot of folks lose part
[SPEAKER_06]: of their dab that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen people feather them and try to
get fancy with it and just set it on there
[SPEAKER_06]: and let her go.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I do, I honestly do turn it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one hole in there and the top of
that carb cap, and I like to turn it just
[SPEAKER_06]: because I think that I move my... I take a
larger dab than most folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I agree with you, and that's one of
the things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to spread it across the top of
the nail just a little bit more than some,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm not trying to be the elitist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just take big fucking dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we're talking temperature,
I can get away with a much lower temp and
[SPEAKER_08]: not waste anything because I'm putting a
much smaller dab to the nail each time.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't do a low temp half gram or a
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: You end up doing a 0.2 dab and the rest of
it puddles and then you feel like a dick
[SPEAKER_08]: for wasting a bunch of your ash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to mention one more thing and then
you just kind of segue me into another
[SPEAKER_06]: part I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, when you're taking a dab with a
carb cap and you're using an e-nail,
[SPEAKER_06]: this happened at the Canna Canyon and it
happens here at
[SPEAKER_06]: the Canna Canyon, and it happens
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to bring this up for the
folks that are learning it on an oil slick
[SPEAKER_06]: pad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see so many people.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an oil slick pad on my table.
[SPEAKER_06]: This pad is designed to catch hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will not stick to here.
[SPEAKER_06]: My table right here, this wood part,
the hash will stick to this all fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put the carb cap down on the oil
slick pad if you see one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what that's for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Utilize that.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I said that would segue me into
another part that I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're giving dabs to somebody,
is it up to me to heat that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like if I give you a dab,
and this will be another question I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: going to ask, one of us pulls a dab off
the parchment paper for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll heat the rig to be nice just because
we're dabbing at my spot or in my car or
[SPEAKER_06]: wherever we happen to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to heat this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to heat the nail to the
appropriate temperature and then maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: we're camping.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to heat the nail to the
appropriate temperature and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_06]: hand it to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I hang onto that fucker until it's the
right temp or do I give it to you and let
[SPEAKER_06]: you decide when to dab that thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much that depends on who you're
talking about handing it to and their
[SPEAKER_08]: level of experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was just going to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's someone new and new to dabbing,
I would just be like, okay, I would just
[SPEAKER_04]: probably hold onto it until it was ready
and then give it to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's somebody you know dabs a lot,
let them make that choice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heat it up, hand it to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them do the hand over the nail like a
wizard trick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because do you remember a couple of weeks
ago when we were having a conversation
[SPEAKER_04]: about how somebody heated up a torch,
like a... That's what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where this came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody tried to be nice and give me a
big fat dab and they heated the nail nice
[SPEAKER_06]: and hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I went to pick up the rig,
they put their hand on it and said,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm polite.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're giving me a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in my mind, I thought it's going to
cool down way too much and this big dab is
[SPEAKER_06]: just going to end up as a puddle on your
nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these guys were like proud of how much
they clean out of their rig with the
[SPEAKER_06]: Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, put that in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We paid for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dispensary wasn't like, oh,
you're going to Q-tip it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's 30% off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand how people can waste
that amount of... It's like when you're
[SPEAKER_08]: paying 20, 30, 60, 80, 100 a gram for
hash, how do you waste half of it on the
[SPEAKER_08]: just letting it puddle and then Q-tipping
it into the trash?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like taking two sips off your beer
and putting the whole bottle, the rest of
[SPEAKER_08]: the bottle of the trash and ordering
another beer and drinking that way all
[SPEAKER_08]: night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's an experienced dabber,
let that dude choose how hot he wants it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want to burn my lungs, if I want to
roast my esophagus, let me do it,
[SPEAKER_06]: please.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you're bringing new people in,
be gentle.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of us have a good story about
introducing someone to hash where they
[SPEAKER_08]: were like, no, I want to take the hit you
took.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we give it one or two, no,
you don't, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a bit of advice, go slow,
very strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they resist a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we say, fuck it and let them jump off
the cliff.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not necessarily cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've told this story of the dude,
a guy, I was at a cannabis cup and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: taking dabs and a guy walked up and he
said, what are you doing there,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, smoking dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, I ain't ever seen dabs
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get a dab?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I gave him what I thought would be a
normal first dab for a guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he got offended.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, that's a little, I saw what you
smoked, give me what you smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I've been doing this,
bro, that's going to fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, I don't care, I can smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I did what he asked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I gave him a Jeff size dab,
heated it up, hooked him up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That dude took that hit and pulled in the
smoke and blew it out and vanished.
[SPEAKER_06]: He walked into the crowd like,
bye, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was so high, he didn't know what to do
with himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: He couldn't look me in the eye anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought it was kind of funny,
but he asked for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a good chunk of my day
explaining to people who aren't familiar
[SPEAKER_08]: with hash and edibles to please go slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I talk to people all the time that have,
I took the way too big a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like the longest 12 hours of my
life while I waited to come down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel bad for those people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we used to be a little gentler with
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there used to be an initiation process
before these products were available.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it negated the necessity to do,
to say a lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people out there whose first
experience with cannabis was a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's unfair.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like the first time you drank when
you were in middle school or a teenager or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever, you had moonshine and you guys
were fucking beer funneling it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're boof and shine for your first
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's like, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's the same thing when I hear like
my first intro to marijuana was a giant
[SPEAKER_08]: dab alive resident.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, and what happened next?
[SPEAKER_08]: You spent seven hours in your hotel room
wondering if you were dead or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just you were too big to handle
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it never should have happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you didn't need to be in that end of
the pool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I need to put a disclaimer on my dab
videos?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not try this at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what that going back to your
original question here, Jeff, I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: about knowing your audience and about
knowing like who's in your car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if it's a, you know, experienced
dabber, let them do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if not, then whatever, screw you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are the worst tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are just trolling me.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, we're, we're, we're mad at
ourselves because we're setting a bad
[SPEAKER_06]: example.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about dabbing in the car,
which shouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hypocrites.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, I didn't even mean in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just meant in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say in the car?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've all, I, you and I each have slipped
about dabbing in the car.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we're outdoorsy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: We spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually do take, I do smoke a lot more
in nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's fucking fun to dab in the car
wash when you're getting the car wash.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one can see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't dab in the car.
[SPEAKER_08]: None of my shit's portable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's not something I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all portable.
[SPEAKER_08]: They make an adapter for the email.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get, let's get out of the
incrimination zone here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So dab size.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the temp thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's somebody new, yeah, if it,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just bring them along slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe decide the temps for your
girlfriend's dab for her.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's such a wonderful world.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can decide our own, our own temp of our
own dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can handle that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If, if I'm wearing my logo on my shirt and
I'm at every fucking secret session you
[SPEAKER_06]: see me at, let me know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me choose my temp on my dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go hot and hurting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys don't do glowy's.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call those glowy's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those hurt your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about dab size.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're, we're all friends here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we have dabs, we come to the
table.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just, there's some of my hash on the
table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay's got some hash on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike didn't bring any today, but I'm not
calling him out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time he brought some hash that tasted
fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I racked myself with that stuff last
night.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit was so flavorful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your excuse this time, cause it was so
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time, but we all, if somebody wants a
dab, this is my, what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Trez star shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mike wants to dab it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to pass him the parchment.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to pull off a dab for himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's my homie over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that how, are you supposed,
am I supposed to pull him off a dab or is
[SPEAKER_06]: that his job or?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Lindsay said it perfectly a second
ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about knowing your audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depends on who's who, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess that's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, you always get that one
kid, you know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So say we're hanging out at the secret
session and we're all a bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a bunch of heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a bunch of family.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's always one guy in every
fucking group.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know who I'm thinking about right
now, that guy, if you hand him your
[SPEAKER_06]: shatter, he's going to try to smoke all of
this in one dab just because he wants to
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke as much as he can while he's there
and get as high as he can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody, every group has that one guy,
that one friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's funny when people ask me for
a dab and they try to do that because then
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to watch them cough and turn red.
[SPEAKER_06]: And turn purple and blow a snot out of
their face.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worth it to me to go ahead and pick
your dab size.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the best part for me is watching them
function after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or fail to function after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know what, Jeff, the thing
about it is, is they watch people like you
[SPEAKER_04]: take huge dabs and, you know, be able to
just take 0.5, you know, or bigger dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sit here and go, well,
I can go on this level with this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they take this one they die and then
they can't function.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you know what you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You continue to take 0.5 or bigger dabs
and you keep going through the night and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just like, what is this guy doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been training, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been training.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your triathlon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been going deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your Olympics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for comparison, there's more residue
on the dabber I just used than the dab I
[SPEAKER_08]: just took.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, you're the segue champion because I
want to talk about ninja dabs right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I love ninja dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninja dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of people, we take for granted
that a lot of folks listening to this
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast are not Colorado based people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell by looking at the stats,
I try to ignore them because I don't want
[SPEAKER_06]: it to influence my performance.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can tell by looking at the stats
that a large portion of our audience is in
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado, but more than 50% is not
Colorado based.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a large portion is not even in
America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those people don't get to dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know what dabs are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody put me back on track.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninja dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna tell you what the fuck ninja
dabs are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninja dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if Lindsay was to get herself a dab and
she was to start dabbing, I would
[SPEAKER_06]: sneakily, I've got my MacBook here open.
[SPEAKER_06]: While she can't see me behind the
computer, I'd put another dab on another
[SPEAKER_06]: dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as soon as Lindsay starts inhaling
that dab right before she puts the carb
[SPEAKER_06]: cap on, I would reach over and put a
sizable amount of hash on the nail for her
[SPEAKER_06]: and ninja dab her.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just add a little to her and make her
cough and get her a little extra fucked up
[SPEAKER_06]: more than she expected.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also seen it referred to putting a
dab underneath the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the carb cap is just a hunk of metal
with a hole in it that you set on top of
[SPEAKER_08]: the hot nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you take some hash and
surreptitiously place it underneath the
[SPEAKER_08]: carb cap, while their carb cap's on their
cap and their dab, it's gonna heat up
[SPEAKER_08]: enough to drop that on the nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a good three, four, five, 10 seconds
into their hit, their hit quadruples all
[SPEAKER_08]: of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't even know where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's happened to me more than once and
has led to some less than productive
[SPEAKER_08]: afternoons.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've called those time bombs or landmines,
but I've also heard them called sniper
[SPEAKER_06]: dabs from other folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Landmines and ninja dabs were as always
what I heard those called.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got multiple carb caps and I'll just
set them out on the table and occasionally
[SPEAKER_06]: one will have a little snake underneath
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone will take a dab and it just keeps
going and they turn red and they blow snot
[SPEAKER_06]: out of their face and they choke for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really funny to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I laugh a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I always know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the blue one.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it ever happens, it's the blue one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got one blue one and the rest are
silver.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that makes it easy for me to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't use that fucking blue one if you
come over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see, we're talking about dab
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got notes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give some dab hints.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's summertime and it's hot as shit here
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your dads are going to be stuck to the
parchment paper and hard to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I saw a dispensary on
Instagram today, selling their hash in
[SPEAKER_06]: little plastic disks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Step up your game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get some parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put your dads in parchment paper or one of
those like silicone containers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get away from the plastic things
where all your dads stick to it and you
[SPEAKER_06]: got to scrape it for fucking days.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're wasting like a quarter gram of hash
in the packaging.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one wants to scrape out of that little
plastic dish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time you go to scrape out of it,
you realize that it's plastic and half the
[SPEAKER_08]: dabbers out here aren't gentle enough to,
I mean, it quickly becomes a question of,
[SPEAKER_08]: am I willing to dab little strips of
plastic or scrape that off my nail or do I
[SPEAKER_08]: just have to kiss the rest of this hash
go?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just let it go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, step your packaging up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sensitive to this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a budtender.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like the packaging matters and a lot
of people don't think it through to the
[SPEAKER_08]: end stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: They come up with the dope product.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's like putting a Lamborghini
engine in a fucking pinto sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to move.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter how good your product
is.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the packaging is hideous and it's not
displayable, it's going to annoy the
[SPEAKER_08]: people that sell it just a little.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if they're annoyed just a little,
they're going to reference the product
[SPEAKER_08]: that isn't annoying more.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to move 10 times faster.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to make a lot less money all
because you didn't think your packaging
[SPEAKER_08]: through to the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're watching it change in waves
in Colorado right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every hash company had their cool,
unique shaped logoed package.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of those are transitioning to almost
identical envelopes now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are seeing it just as fast as I
am up in the springs, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It matters, folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to go on a little tangent,
but the packaging matters.
[SPEAKER_08]: While the original point of this was it's
summer, the shatter's a little tacky right
[SPEAKER_08]: now.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a problem when it's a plastic
container.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use parchment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But where I was headed with that is air
conditioner tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, when your shatter is getting all
funky, go just set that shatter,
[SPEAKER_06]: put it in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you're not going to be in there
for more than four or five minutes,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't have to put it in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just set that parchment in the freezer,
close the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you set it in a dry area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Close the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let that shit get nice and cold for a few
minutes and pull it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you can function with that
shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a whole lot easier to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be real snappy, real
crunchy.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you may be aware, there's an air
conditioner in places.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can turn on that vent and turn that
fucker up, cool down your carb cap,
[SPEAKER_06]: cool down your dabber, and then you can
cool down your shatter also.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll make it a whole lot easier for you
guys to function.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I don't buy a lot of shatter
during the summer for this exact reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want to bother.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I go with a butter or a wax or a live
resin, it's already a little tacky or
[SPEAKER_08]: soupy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The room temperature is not going to mess
with it much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ain't no season going to stop me from
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just dab different.
[SPEAKER_06]: This ain't seasonal.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something I do all day,
every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not no fair weather fan.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just throw out extra money on hash and
go live resin all summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever been in the cold that wears
so cold your torch wouldn't light?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just goes click, click, click,
and it won't light.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a smoker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can make fire anywhere, sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have seen your dedication to your
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can make fire anywhere, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you had been on my hike yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, me and the hike don't happen in the
same sense a lot, but I could teach you
[SPEAKER_08]: some things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lindsay seems to be really good at
forgetting a fire source.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's what us tumor-ridden fucks are
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've always got seven bicks.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can find a way to get that nail hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should always say, if you're going
to be dabbing and you're on the go and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going somewhere to dab,
somebody take a can of butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no idea how many times
everybody's had everything we've needed to
[SPEAKER_06]: take dabs and nobody had any butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm the guy with the can of butane in
my backpack.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, I'll treat you guys a fat dab
for this butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I get the next dab that comes out
of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as that torch is filled,
guess who gets a dab?
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I had the butane to save the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's the Boy Scout in me
or the smoker or the stoner, but I've
[SPEAKER_08]: always got a couple of lighters.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if I'm going to go dab somewhere,
I like a can of butane, two torches,
[SPEAKER_08]: two nails, two rigs, because rigs get
dropped, nails get lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all sorts of weird shit happens and
it ruins the session.
[SPEAKER_08]: If, Oh dude, we could all be high right
now, but we forgot a part and our weeds
[SPEAKER_08]: fancy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we're sober.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay texted me one night.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, dude, I'm somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to smoke some hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have a rig and no torch?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that, was that the story?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had a rig and I had no torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we say rig and it sounds terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: By a rig, we mean a small water pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer a smaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went over this on another episode,
a small pipe with a dab nail on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We go domeless nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of us use what's called a banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a quartz hash nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a quartz hash bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking marvelous.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Lindsay had the pipe and the nail
part, but she didn't have a way to make
[SPEAKER_06]: the nail part hot to where she could melt
hash on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember my advice, Lindsay,
the way that I really thought would work
[SPEAKER_06]: for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, when you gave me two that I thought
were actually quite, so you gave me the
[SPEAKER_04]: gas stove, which, you know, electric
stove.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way it would have worked.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a stove.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use the damn stove.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, I just take the nail out and
heat the nail on the stove.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other one was the car,
um, the car cigarette lighter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told her to use the car cigarette
lighter as a carb cap on the banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you just heat that fucker up till
it glows and then you drop your dab in the
[SPEAKER_06]: banger and then put the cigarette lighter
over it and draw the heat would work just
[SPEAKER_06]: like how the carb cap works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she didn't try it because she didn't
have the fucking cigarette lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine doesn't work in my car.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so if you're, if you're screwed
and you got a banger, you could probably
[SPEAKER_06]: take a dab by using that cigarette
lighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's what the nail in the,
the rig is for is it replaces hot knife
[SPEAKER_08]: hits in the world of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: A hot knife hits is exactly what it sounds
like.
[SPEAKER_08]: You take two butter knives, you stick them
in an electric stove until the tips glow
[SPEAKER_08]: and then mash a piece of hash in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how like everyone in Europe got
stoned from like 71 to 75.
[SPEAKER_06]: Used to smoke hash like that in my buddy
Sam's fucking kitchen years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Sammy.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: When people my parents age come into the
shop and ask for hash, what they're
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking about is hot knife hits or the
little pin under the beer mug.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't even believe that what we have
now is hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what is that shit?
[SPEAKER_08]: I literally explained it is this is the
new fancy hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's my intro sentence for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the easiest way to bring them up to
speed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, hot knife hits work on the fancy
hash too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a little closer to crack smoke
and then most of us likes to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: One time I saw our buddy Kevin took his
car cigarette lighter and took a dab and
[SPEAKER_06]: just threw the dab on the car cigarette
lighter and inhaled what came off of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's portable and functional.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it fucking worked for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's easily hidden.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just put it right back in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably never worked again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get that far.
[SPEAKER_06]: One time we were at a party late one night
and we were smoking a bowl and we had
[SPEAKER_06]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was before like, like Kevin and I
were kind of, we were some of the first
[SPEAKER_06]: dab kids around here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone was smoking weed at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, Kevin was making shatter out of the
material I was growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were kind of ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'd go places and people wouldn't have
a rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't, I didn't used to drive
around with a rig on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't take glass with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't do any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't like taking a rig with me
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we would get a bowl burning real hot,
just get it super ridiculous, charried,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then just drop globs of hash onto it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then try to smoke as much of that as
we could.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would make us choke so hard,
but we would get high as shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did so much bizarre shit back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: The swing arm skillets where we'd have
them glowing like the sun and then throw a
[SPEAKER_08]: quarter gram dab down because we didn't
know anything about what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that oil would just fly out onto your
legs and shit while you were hitting it at
[SPEAKER_08]: boiling temp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to my buddy Jordan Segoto.
[SPEAKER_06]: One day we were dabbing and he heated the
banger and I don't know what he was
[SPEAKER_06]: thinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: He grabbed a fat dab and like heats the
banger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sets the torch down and just puts the dab
on the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually you got to wait at least a few
seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of these new kids are setting a
fucking timer.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a little fucking hourglass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, Jordan just goes right in.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just goes in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was probably 15 feet away from him
sitting in another chair and I could hear
[SPEAKER_06]: the dab scream.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dab went.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we could all hear it from across the
room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that dude turned to purple and red and
tons of different colors and cough
[SPEAKER_06]: forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: That poor dude took the hottest dab ever
and I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit was terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glowy, glowy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first generation of dab kids have some
of the best little burn and brand marks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's your where's your dab wound?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got two drip wounds on one of my legs
from the skillet days that you can't
[SPEAKER_08]: really tell what they're like.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're dab related unless you get
explained and then the stripe makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I remember seeing kids like when
domeless nails first started being notched
[SPEAKER_08]: a little bit sort of like castle towers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in like Walmart or some shit and a
kid reached out with some money and I saw
[SPEAKER_08]: on his forearm that he had that brand mark
on his wrist and I was just fucking busted
[SPEAKER_08]: up laughing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a whole bunch of the circular
domeless nail burns.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back in the dome days, people had all
sorts of crazy drip burns.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys don't let your friends try to
carve the dab rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't pull that hot nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just heat it up with the torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't carve it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to burn and you're not
going to carve it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just smoke, it'll quit smoking when
it's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: A friend of mine, he was being handed a
rig and the person almost dropped it and
[SPEAKER_08]: he reached out reflexively and grabbed it
and the heat sinks in the top of the nail
[SPEAKER_08]: lined up in between his thumb and
forefinger and the brand right there looks
[SPEAKER_08]: like half space alieny just because of the
way the dab hole pressed into his hand and
[SPEAKER_08]: then the heat sinks below it, the little
metal stripes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was hideous, but now the brand
looks cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the plus side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back to a positive note,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: This place is going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what dabs do to the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new thing is to take some good shatter
or some good hash of any kind and then
[SPEAKER_06]: dunk it into fresh terpenes either from...
Words are hard at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue River or of course our friends at Evo
Labs, that is the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think dunking the dabs and terps kind of
pushes it to a whole new level.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ghost drain haze dabs make my eyes
vibrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lemon G dabs make my head spin a little
bit and the OG Kush dabs just make me want
[SPEAKER_06]: to lay down and chill the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The terps, the terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these new terps are definitely the next
level.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, if you have the opportunity,
come to Colorado, find a store that sells
[SPEAKER_06]: terps recreationally, get some shatter,
get some terps, put a dab of shatter on a
[SPEAKER_06]: dabber and dunk it into the container of
terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that onto a properly-temperatured
nail, carb cap it, enjoy the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come to Colorado, say what's up,
come see us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take a hike with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take a dab with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're volunteering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you guys, we've been going for
45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are getting ADD.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people at the table are super high and
they're getting really quiet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it feels like it's time to wrap up this
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, you look good and high.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we going to say?
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, I'm thinking about terps now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just distracted and now I remember
those are over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for a dunk and dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for a dunk and dab nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds way worse than it's going to
be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, shout out your Twitter handle so
that folks can follow you and also remind
[SPEAKER_06]: them of your Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter and Pueblo
for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lindsay, that's a killer stretch.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's inspiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making me want to stretch and get
an inch taller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't even talk after it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look like you had like a stroke
almost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind everybody how they can follow you
on all the social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the Traveling Stoner on Instagram and
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Snapchat is Traveling Stoner without
the G and my Twitter is the Travel Stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Facebook is the Traveling Stoner
too, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you talking about your website?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because it's not... Don't go there
yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, it's not up and ready yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chill out on that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just put her on the spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now she's got to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you guys for coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's fucking midnight now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know everybody has to work in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to all the people that are
out there busting their ass, all the
[SPEAKER_06]: growers, all the bud tenders, everybody
that's making this new industry move.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no room for some lazy fucks in
this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the people that are on it now are
grinding a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's time to step up and get it going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone just gave me that yeah look.
[SPEAKER_08]: I laugh at the lazy stoner stereotype.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you see this industry work,
it's such a... Yeah, bro, we put it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the people that have been
trimming all week at The Grow.

dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a future episode, we'll have the
dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about pests and issues
and how to solve those and shit like that
[SPEAKER_06]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to my ninja spin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank my friends for joining me
once again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for episode number 147 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_06]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_06]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_06]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_06]: for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends call me Ross the Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_06]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Kat Kuhn and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, I'm starting this podcast off
kind of bummed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm disappointed in myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm disappointed in technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I recorded a marvelous podcast
with the dabbing granny, with Brett from
[SPEAKER_06]: Evo Labs, and of course our friend
Lindsay, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: This evening, I pulled out my zoom age
six.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took out my trusty memory card.
[SPEAKER_06]: I threw it in my Mac book and the files
are all there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can grab the files and I can move them
to my Mac book, but for some reason,
[SPEAKER_06]: none of that shit is playable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So none of the material that I recorded
with dabbing granny will be aired on this
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast unless one of my tech savvy
friends is able to get this SD card and
[SPEAKER_06]: pull this information off of there in a
usable format because so far I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I did was frustrate myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not able to get it going.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me turn down the music and see
[SPEAKER_06]: if I can get it going.
[SPEAKER_06]: The good news, however, is that dabbing
granny has got to come back to the show
[SPEAKER_06]: and Brett's got to come back and Lindsay
has to come back and we have to do another
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I want to do a podcast with granny
by herself and with Brett by himself and
[SPEAKER_06]: then a podcast with the group together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think granny should be on the podcast
kind of frequently because she has a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of great shit to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually think granny needs,
she had so much to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I encouraged her to start her own podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something that I actually said when
she was here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I advertise that like we're going to have
an amazing episode for you today.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be the episode that you
expected, but I'm going to do my best to
[SPEAKER_06]: make it amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody that was on the episode that
fucked up, I invite you guys all to come
[SPEAKER_06]: back.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hung out at the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We smoked so much hash that it was
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a few friends stop by, Pop D and
Chosen One, Pop D Glass Art and Chosen One
[SPEAKER_06]: Glass Art showed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They hung out with us, took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron hung out for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to everybody that tried to
make that podcast happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to move forward and quit talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about some positive things.
[SPEAKER_06]: More positive stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, the other night I got to see
Joey Coco Diaz at ComedyWorks in downtown
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know anything about me,
you know that I love comedy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You also know that I love ComedyWorks in
downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that ComedyWorks downtown is
probably the best comedy club on the
[SPEAKER_06]: planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's the second, it's the second best
to the comedy store in Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_06]: California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, ComedyWorks is the best
comedy club in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, since I'm talking about comedy,
you guys, I saw Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be my favorite damn comedian
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That dude blew the roof off of
ComedyWorks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey Diaz walked out on stage and he
grabbed the mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before he could get to the mic,
he got a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey walked out to a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_06]: He grabbed the mic and he said,
what up, you bad motherfuckers?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just the way Joey starts the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I knew it was going to be a party from
then.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had this little strut in his stride the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey was killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The show was hosted by a comedian whose
name I cannot recall.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a new guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got some dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a very entertaining dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another comedian whose name I
cannot remember who was the opening act.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there was a feature act whose name
was Rick, who I've seen several times.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, everyone's trying to do a bunch of
weed jokes in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, if you're a comedian,
an aspiring comedian, a touring comedian,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're a funny guy and you're coming to
Colorado, chill out on the weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've heard it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've heard every fucking weed joke you're
going to tell, unless you got some super
[SPEAKER_06]: creative weed joke, we've heard it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for the pros.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for the noobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've heard all the weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the opening act, both, all three did a
couple of weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The host did a couple of weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey barely talked about weed,
but Joey smokes more weed than you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey eats more edibles than you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Joey still is able to go on stage and
put out an amazing fucking comedy show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey had me laughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey Coco Diaz, you guys, he is the host
of a podcast called The Church of What's
[SPEAKER_06]: Happening Now.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in a movie called The Longest Yard.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an amazing comedian.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's Joe Rogan's favorite comedian,
if that tells you anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had me laughing so hard that the sides
of my stomach and ribs were hurting.
[SPEAKER_06]: My back was hurting in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_06]: My cheeks hurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little spot like right behind
where my sunglasses would rest on my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit hurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt like someone was just squeezing my
head and it was from laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I told my buddy, I was like,
I'm laughing so hard, I think I'm going to
[SPEAKER_06]: cry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Joey might've heard me because
when he heard that I was going to cry,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he just started hitting harder.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, oh, you're laughing now,
motherfucker, watch this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had tears coming out of my left eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: My right eye was twitching weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't laughed that hard in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I probably won't laugh that hard again
because Joey, was fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: He blew the roof off of ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love to Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also a big special thank you to my
friend Baker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Baker, I truly appreciate what you do for
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always treated like a VIP at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also shout out to my friend Buzzy for
buying the tickets.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I got a sweet deal with my buddy
Buzzy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He buys tickets and I drive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we go see comedy shows and it's
fucking amazingly fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to my new friends that I made
that night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about other positive things
that happened in my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last night, you guys, I got to see one of
my favorite bands, Joseph Israel and the
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerusalem Band.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were in my hometown of Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were 10 minutes away from my house at
the Brews Ale House.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I had to do was drive over there,
find parking, march on in and get my
[SPEAKER_06]: reggae on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was local.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Brews Ale House.
[SPEAKER_06]: That club is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably the best venue in Pueblo
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a couple of theaters,
they compete, but I'm going to give that
[SPEAKER_06]: place the number one venue for the vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a back door that rolls up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right on the river walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the river right behind you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sound is good in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The vibe is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a great place.
[SPEAKER_06]: The band, oh my goodness, Joseph Israel
and the band tore it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I've been seeing Joseph Israel
for probably, I've been watching his band
[SPEAKER_06]: for probably 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen several of their shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen this band progress and come a
long, long way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And last night's show was the best show
that I've ever seen them do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the second to last show on their
tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could tell that they just played
until they were done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight's show, they're not going to have
a lot of energy because they wore
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves out last night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever sees them tonight, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I drained all their energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite album from Joseph Israel is an
album called Gone Are the Days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was his original release.
[SPEAKER_06]: They played, there were probably 15 songs
on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a couple of them are like dub
remixes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's like probably 10 songs on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They must have played seven or eight of
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they played all my favorites.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could yell out a song and they would
play it for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't going to play.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were going to play a song called
Truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: But truth is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a break.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when the musicians are like
tuning their guitars and they're all
[SPEAKER_06]: talking and taking a drink, I yelled out
truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like right in the front row.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Joseph looked at me like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they talked about it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, we haven't played this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't practice this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't played this since we recorded
the Gone Are the Days album.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they started singing the chorus.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just started doing like a really cool
acapella harmony version of the chorus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once that chorus ended,
the guitar player started playing the
[SPEAKER_06]: guitar lick and they played the song.
[SPEAKER_06]: Truth for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't tight and it wasn't perfect,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was beautiful that my friends tried to
play that song for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much love to Joseph Israel and the
Jerusalem band and the entire crew at
[SPEAKER_06]: Brews Ale House.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to smoke after the show with a
couple of the guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been a huge fan of a bass player by
the name of Chris Meredith.
[SPEAKER_06]: He plays with Joseph Israel and the
Jerusalem band.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's also known as a recording artist
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's also well known for playing with
Stephen Martin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I walked into the building and Chris
Meredith was just standing there talking
[SPEAKER_06]: to Joseph Israel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realized he was going to be the bass
player for the show that night.
[SPEAKER_06]: They put a huge smile on my face because
he recorded Joseph's album with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went on tour for the first tour and
then he had to go back to Jamaica and he
[SPEAKER_06]: took off for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we didn't see him on tour with Joseph.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great to see Chris and the original
drummer back together in the rhythm
[SPEAKER_06]: section.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually got to meet the original
keyboard player from the Gone Are the Days
[SPEAKER_06]: album.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to talk about the recording.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to talk about a few things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to talk about the Tough Gong recording
studio in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really nice to hang out with some
Jamaican Rastas, some faithful folks,
[SPEAKER_06]: folks with good vibes, folks with positive
energy, with good things to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I recommend that you listen to
Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem band.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just talked about them for like five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to move on from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But big shout out, much love, much
respect, much good vibes from Joseph
[SPEAKER_06]: Israel and the Jerusalem band last night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the friend that went with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun dancing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to laugh at some crazy drunk
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, drunk people are super entertaining.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so glad I do not consume alcohol
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just smoke mad cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: There may have been a little smoke session
in the back of the club at the end of the
[SPEAKER_06]: night.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on to some grow
knowledge, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Been talking about my weekend and my week
long enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about grow knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few episodes back, I was asked how to
handle grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I've noticed is everybody is
getting bombarded with grasshoppers and
[SPEAKER_06]: their outdoor cannabis grow this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: The number one way that you can get rid of
your grasshoppers is just to clean up.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can mow all the grass, mow all the
weeds, get rid of anywhere for them to
[SPEAKER_06]: live, get rid of all the stuff for them to
eat, the grasshoppers won't want to come
[SPEAKER_06]: around.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that your neighbors probably
have a big ass pile of grass and leaves
[SPEAKER_06]: and shit in their yard that you cannot do
anything about.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's illegal to go over there with the
torch and just burn that shit down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're having problems with
grasshoppers, somebody recommended to me
[SPEAKER_06]: garlic and fermented garlic sprays to help
keep grasshoppers and other pests away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume that this would work on most
insects and most living creatures.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ferment some garlic or mush garlic
up into a spray and spray that around your
[SPEAKER_06]: plants on and or around your plants and on
the perimeter of your plants, most bugs
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to stay away from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely you will not have any
vampires.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're worried about vampires in the
garden, you could double up on the garlic
[SPEAKER_06]: spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to the person that told me
about fermented garlic sprays and using
[SPEAKER_06]: them in my garden to keep away
grasshoppers outdoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't grow outdoors myself very
much, but a lot of our friends do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in the next episode may
feature our buddy, Jesse, and we're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to talk about some outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening to this, call me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's plan this episode so we can get it
recorded.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll record it at my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll use my computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't use the Zoom H6 because I'm
paranoid of that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm afraid it's going to break and not
record the damn show again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably won't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grasshoppers, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some emails here in my phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: People have asked some questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys ask great questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a shout out to everybody
that sends me an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to read all of the
questions over time on the air,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm a little bit backed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to have to record more
episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, here's an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: They came from, let's see, how did he sign
it?
[SPEAKER_06]: He signed it Mazar420.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to Mazar420.
[SPEAKER_06]: His email says, hoping you can read my
questions on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Been loving the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Helps me get through my day at a mind
numbing job with robots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you work with robots or just like
people who are unaware and people who are
[SPEAKER_06]: programmed to act like robots?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, he said, questions for the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you flip to 1212 or 1113 DJ short
style, how long till you want to go from
[SPEAKER_06]: metal halide to HPS?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I want to talk about this 1212 or 1113
DJ short style thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What Mazar420 is asking is when I change
my light cycle from my vegetative stage,
[SPEAKER_06]: either 24 hours on or an 18 six cycle,
or maybe a 16 eight, depends on where you
[SPEAKER_06]: are.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I change my light cycle to my
flowering phase, which would normally be
[SPEAKER_06]: 1212, or he says the 1113 DJ short style.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me talk about that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ short is a well-known breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a great speaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an author is well-educated and very
passionate about the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ short breeds amazing strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is known for the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ short bred the flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's something in DJ short's catalog
that you have smoked and you have enjoyed
[SPEAKER_06]: that came from old DJ.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now DJ does a trick when he's flowering
his plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does not run them for 12 on 12 off.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does 11 hours on and 13 hours off.
[SPEAKER_06]: His theory on this is that you will see
broader variants in phenotypical
[SPEAKER_06]: expression from your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're a breeder and you're looking
for phenotypes, this extra hour really
[SPEAKER_06]: lets the plants express themselves and
show the variation and show their
[SPEAKER_06]: potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also will save you one hour of
electricity over a 65 day cycle,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is going to be 65 hours,
kilowatt hours that you're not spending on
[SPEAKER_06]: your lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also going to be an hour resting off
of your air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also going to, some people think it
increases their yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't like what it did to some of my
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did like what it did to some of my
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very plant specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's strain specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not experimented enough to know,
but a lot of people in the community are
[SPEAKER_06]: switching to the 11 13 method.
[SPEAKER_06]: It saves money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It saves time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've got the right varietals,
it will work for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I've noticed, some of my heavier
sativas didn't like it in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took them a while to get used to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked my sativas on 12 12 and then
toward the end of the phase, that's when I
[SPEAKER_06]: would start dropping down the timers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't seem to really like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I went 13 hours of darkness right
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that catches us up to speed on the DJ
short 11 13 method.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now he says, how long, once you do this
flip, do you want to go from metal halide
[SPEAKER_06]: to HPS?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's his first part of his question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, I let it go 10 to 14 days
rocking the metal halide.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I see the buds starting to form,
when I see those little pre buds and the
[SPEAKER_06]: pre flowers just starting to pop up and
they're getting a little dandelions,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's usually when I switch in that bulb.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you, if you really want to go crazy,
do it three weeks, because I think when
[SPEAKER_06]: you flip, those plants are going to
stretch for about three weeks and keeping
[SPEAKER_06]: that halide bulb in there really,
I think helps prevent them from stretching
[SPEAKER_06]: so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep that halide in there for 10 to 14
days.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go extreme, go 21 days,
but you may slow down bud development at
[SPEAKER_06]: that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to switch it in there about that
14th day, because that's when my buds are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to start happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that you can utilize that I've
done and had great success with is mix and
[SPEAKER_06]: match spectrums.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use a little bit of metal halide and use a
little bit of HPS if you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a, I've got a reflector,
it's called the Groszilla and I haven't
[SPEAKER_06]: used it in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should fire it up and do some
experiments with it just for fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this reflector holds two bulbs and
they say not to put more than a thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: watt total in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may say 1200 total.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could put two 600 bulbs in this one
reflector.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did, I put a 600 watt high pressure
sodium and a 400 watt metal halide in
[SPEAKER_06]: there and hung that bulb in a five by five
hydro hut.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I put nine three gallon pots under
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I grew some of the most
photogenic and most aromatic, most
[SPEAKER_06]: flavorful and most potent cannabis I have
ever grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: It came from that five by five hut with
that mixed spectrum light.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was some very impressive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only problem was it didn't harvest
what I wished it would have.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I use a thousand watt HPS in one of
those huts with proper ducting and venting
[SPEAKER_06]: and air conditioning, I can pull a pound
and a half really close to two pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to hit two pounds in those huts
because you're really limited on height
[SPEAKER_06]: and space.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got to like top them out and pull
them out real far and train them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get a pound and a half out of one
of those huts.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I did the HPS metal halide combo,
I got right about a pound and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it didn't do what I would expect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that 600 watt light kind of didn't
let it push, but the flavor and the aroma
[SPEAKER_06]: and the potency made up for the lack of
weight because it was for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was growing it from my own head stash,
so I didn't need a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the first part of your question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would do it somewhere between 14 and 21
days, 10 days if you're trying to go
[SPEAKER_06]: early, 14 days is about ideal,
21 days if you're really trying to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: those plants short.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that halide lamp is going to keep
them from stretching on you as part of why
[SPEAKER_06]: we do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he also says, also was wondering how
long once under 12, 12, do you wait to
[SPEAKER_06]: switch your nutrients from veg to bloom?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he also says, hope to hear my
questions get answered on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely Mazur420.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's wondering how long from the day we
switched to 12, 12, do we wait to switch
[SPEAKER_06]: our nutrients from veg to bloom?
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of do a slow transition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that your plant is going to
absorb somewhere between 80 and 90% of its
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrogen that all of it's going to absorb
through its whole life.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to absorb most of that through
the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you hit flowering, once you get to
that second or third week of flowering,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not going to use a whole lot of
nitrogen, just enough to keep the leaves
[SPEAKER_06]: green and keep the plant moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: So nitrogen is going to kind of fizzle
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can switch the nutrients right away
if you'd like to, or you can keep those
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients going slowly and taper.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you've got grow and you've got
bloom, maybe go seven to 10 days with that
[SPEAKER_06]: grow before you pull out the grow nutrient
and throw in the bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can just switch right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of depends on the strains also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gorilla glue really likes to eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of stick with my veg nutrients
for an extra week or two with the gorilla
[SPEAKER_06]: glue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things like flow, flow doesn't require a
lot of food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flow will just grow like a son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll switch flow right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I go 12, 12, that day they get fed
their bloom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: They start getting, basically your first
day of bloom nutrients aren't very far
[SPEAKER_06]: off.
[SPEAKER_06]: From your last week of veg nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it shouldn't be too abrupt of a switch
either way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But somewhere between that first day and
about seven to 10 days in is when I will
[SPEAKER_06]: totally have switched from veg to bloom
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of depends on the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of depends on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of depends on the room,
the strain, the brand of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm using botanical or bottled newts,
my switch from my veg stage to my flower
[SPEAKER_06]: phase, like I said, is not very different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Cal Mag, Liquid Karma, and maybe a
little bit of, what else am I using?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a dog resting on my feet and I
just moved my foot and kicked him right in
[SPEAKER_06]: the head.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, puppy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to do that, boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Mick the dog,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mick the dog's been hanging out with me
for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a cool ass dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys would like him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I just kicked you right in the
head, boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone on the show hears me apologizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't do it again, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll pet you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, my veg newts.
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be some, what did I say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Base nutrients, which would be the
Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you got some Cal Mag in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a little bit of Liquid Karma.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some potassium silicates.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically my veg mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would add something in there for roots,
some sort of root inoculate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use whatever you would like.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use either the Plus Life from Veg
Bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could use the Rhizo mix that
Botanicare makes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could use, what am I thinking?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one product I'm really thinking I
can't say the name.
[SPEAKER_06]: OG BioWare.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use some OG BioWare on that bitch to get
your roots going.
[SPEAKER_06]: So add that to it for roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you got pretty much everything you
need there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Week one of flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You basically want to feed the same thing
that you've been feeding for the last
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of weeks of veg, because your
plants are just going to start
[SPEAKER_06]: transitioning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So week one, you've got the option at week
one to switch out that Pure Blend Pro Grow
[SPEAKER_06]: to the Bloom formula.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can do it at the start of week two,
or definitely do it by week three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your plants aren't going to need that much
nitrogen by week three.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you keep going with the grow
formula, you may burn them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can go the first week or two with
your grow newts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then by week three, definitely switch
all the way into your flowering newts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to add everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: By week three, you really don't need a lot
at week three.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can start introducing things slowly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe get some sugars in there at week
three.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need a lot at week three.
[SPEAKER_06]: By week four, five, and six, that's where
things really start cracking.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when you're going to want to start
adding bud boosters, whatever you're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to use to make the weight a little
thicker, whatever you're going to use to
[SPEAKER_06]: sweeten it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Four, five, and six is when all that shit
comes in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're running a strain that likes a
lot of nitrogen, keep those nitrogen
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep that base grow newt coming for the
first couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a strain that's got plenty
of nutrients, if your leaves are nice and
[SPEAKER_06]: lush green, if they're dark green,
don't even worry about that grow newt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and switch it over to the bloom
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I used Botanicare as an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the brand that I use in my small
batch personal grows for myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to smoke it, it's probably
grown with Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do plan on doing a side-by-side between
Botanicare and Veg Bloom in the near
[SPEAKER_06]: future.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will be completely honest about what
I see and I will share my experience and
[SPEAKER_06]: my results here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys make sure you support Botanicare
and Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've used them both in different
environments and different scenarios and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're both wonderful products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to run a side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a five-by-five hut and another
five-by-five hydro hut in a room with very
[SPEAKER_06]: similar light with the same lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're on a flip box.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every 12 hours, one comes on, one shuts
off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got a flowering chamber that's
always being used.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do Veg Bloom on one side and
I want to do Botanicare on the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will completely post a ton of
pictures to my Instagram and I'll let you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank our friend Mazart420 for
sending me a great email that gave me a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of information to ramble off at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I'm pulling up the next email
here on my phone.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next email comes from, he signed it
with his real name.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now he says, hi, my name is Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's read this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have spoken before, but I have another
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I live in Oklahoma city where the heat
gets pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can get into a hundred or above in my
garden room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if a bigger carbon filter
would help me out any.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now I'm running a 400 watt high
pressure sodium and a metal halide Apollo
[SPEAKER_06]: light with a four inch carbon filter and
inline fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking about getting an air
conditioner, but I don't want to,
[SPEAKER_06]: if I can lower temps with the carbon
filters during the day, the temps get from
[SPEAKER_06]: 110 to 115.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Growers love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, 110 and 115 in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is tremendously warm for your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your plants are freaking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Development stops, growth and development
stops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Production stops inside your plant around
85, 90 degrees, unless you're introducing
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're inducing CO2, if you've got very
high levels of CO2, your plants can
[SPEAKER_06]: tolerate in the nineties, 110 to 115,
you're stressing the shit out of those
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: The buds are starting to spread out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting airy buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be fluffy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be small.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants are going to be stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: The humidity is probably getting fucking
ridiculous in that room with that type of
[SPEAKER_06]: heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: The good thing about this is you're not
going to have any bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: No damn bug in the world is going to want
to hang out in 115 degree grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your main question, let's get to the
point here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your question is, will a carbon filter
help cool that room?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: A carbon filter does not provide any
cooling.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to introduce cooler air into that
room and you need to remove the hot air
[SPEAKER_06]: from the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: A fan won't help you because it's just
going to blow hot air around.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to exchange the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to get that heat out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe bigger ducting and a bigger blower
to blow the heat out, but a bigger carbon
[SPEAKER_06]: filter won't help you cool the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a large room, get yourself a
window model like the window kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a smaller room and you don't have
a window for it, get yourself one of those
[SPEAKER_06]: portable rolling air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like the Solius 14,000 BTU
portable air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not sponsor me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what I buy if I need an air
conditioner, a rolling air conditioner for
[SPEAKER_06]: a home grow or a small grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I go get is one of those
Solius 14,000 BTU.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a heater.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an air conditioner and it's a
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all in one unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about waist high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only about three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a little R2D2.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a duct that runs out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's got a duct that can come in
also if you choose to duct in,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I don't duct in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just let the air conditioner recycle the
air in the room is where that air comes
[SPEAKER_06]: from.
[SPEAKER_06]: That air is already cool that's going into
the compressor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it blows the heat through a duct,
a four-inch duct.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can mount that duct wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually board up a window, cut a
four-inch hole through the window,
[SPEAKER_06]: put a duct mount onto that window,
and run that four-inch air conditioning
[SPEAKER_06]: duct right out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That 14,000 BTU unit would be overkill for
your 400 watt HPS and your metal Howlite
[SPEAKER_06]: Apollo light.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that your small grow room is
inside of another room since it's so
[SPEAKER_06]: small.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not worried that you have a small grow
room and I'm not making fun of you,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm just wondering, is this grow room
inside of another room?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you construct a small room inside of a
bedroom or this may be a closet also?
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's a small room, maybe you can
air condition that room a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: better and then duct the heat out of your
grow and just air condition the outside
[SPEAKER_06]: environment so that you're bringing in
cooler air.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just need cooler air in that room.
[SPEAKER_06]: A carbon filter is not going to cool off
the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: A fan is not going to cool off the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually need some freon in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need an air conditioner, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to our friend, Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, we've spoken before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember seeing your name.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember you're reading your email
address.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_06]: I encourage you to send me more emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will read your questions and answer your
questions on the podcast all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody wants to send me an email,
I would love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to follow me on Twitter,
it's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check me out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I post a whole bunch of quality
cannabis photography on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Iri, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I have to press pause for one
quick second.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a dab and a drink and I
will be right back with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just took a big old fat dab of pineapple
jack shatter from Turpex and I dunked it
[SPEAKER_06]: in OG Ghost Train Haze fresh turps from
our friends at Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like my brain was put on a
rocket and launched into outer space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it blew up like one of those
beautiful fireworks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it all just came back together
and floated down into my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happens when you dunk your
dad's in turps and you take big old fat
[SPEAKER_06]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to everybody involved in making
these turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turps happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the lab manager from Evo Labs on the
last podcast and that's the one that the
[SPEAKER_06]: memory card ate and we cannot listen to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sorry, Brett.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we could have done that,
but Brett, that means you got to come back
[SPEAKER_06]: on the show and smoke some turps with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I owe a huge thank you to Dab and Granny
and I owe a huge thank you to Brett.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dab and Granny showed up with enough turps
to dab out an army and Brett tried to
[SPEAKER_06]: compete with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big thanks to you guys for showing up
to the podcast well prepared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also thanks to the Canna Canyon for
letting me invade the small corner of
[SPEAKER_06]: their facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had four couches and a table occupied
and nobody could hang out in that region
[SPEAKER_06]: because we were doing the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mind if people hung out,
but when they saw the microphones come out
[SPEAKER_06]: and they heard me talking, they all just
took off to be polite.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind if they hang out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the ambience and the vibe in the
background.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am rambling like a motherfucker hashtag.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like it when I ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to share with you guys a little
progress on my most current breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: project.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you follow me, you know that I am a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the head breeder for Eyrie Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am currently working with a male plant
that I call Arise.
[SPEAKER_06]: The strain is known as Arise.
[SPEAKER_06]: The male plant himself has been named
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is going to father many children.
[SPEAKER_06]: He will be the grandfather to many
children.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Solomon is my male plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is an Arise plant, which is a cross of
a golden goat female that was pollinated
[SPEAKER_06]: by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_06]: Daybreaker came from Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much love and respect to Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: The daybreaker is Joseph O.
[SPEAKER_06]: G.
[SPEAKER_06]: and Kim D.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's going to be a little bit of O.
G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kush and Kim Dog lineage in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I crossed that to, I put the
pollen from that male onto the golden
[SPEAKER_06]: goat.
[SPEAKER_06]: The golden goat is island sweet skunk and
Romulan and a Hawaiian sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got that tropical tasty flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pollinated it with that cushy,
skunky funk flavor, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: everything in my opinion, mixed it all
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it made a strain called Arise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I found three or four really great
phenotypes of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a very golden goat reminiscent
phenotype of Arise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not keep that one because I've got a
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one that's got this sweet,
skunky, funky.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't keep it in a baggie without all
your friends saying, smoke some of that
[SPEAKER_06]: weed with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of smell to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my favorite female of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there's one that makes really long,
skinny buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know where it came from,
but it gives you this hazy eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where the haze came from in
the genetics, but it just makes your head
[SPEAKER_06]: melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your eyes just get retarded, squinty.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go dumb.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just start stuttering.
[SPEAKER_06]: That phenotype is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are three or four key phenotypes
that I've found.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've put all three of those phenotypes,
not the golden goat dominant phenotype,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I put my three favorite phenotypes in
a room with a male of this same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the male of the same strain from the
same seed pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all F1s.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I put the F1s, the male and the female
in a room.
[SPEAKER_06]: This male, I posted pictures of him to my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: He makes male flower clusters as long as
my arm, which is very amazing for a male
[SPEAKER_06]: plant to make buds like Arise.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a little bit of resin on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells very pungent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a hint of vomit to the smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a breeder, vomit is a good trait.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a male plant that smells
like vomit or feet or a bar trash can,
[SPEAKER_06]: that is a good breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to pass on good, good
aromatic traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got that male.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I've got, let's see, what else is
in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a golden goat female because I'm
going to do a little bit of a golden goat
[SPEAKER_06]: bat cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lemon skunk female in there
because I want to see what this Arise
does.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is a grateful dog female.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are multiple phenotypes of the
Arise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there'll be Arise F2s coming out very
soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be tested by a bunch of my people
before they're available to you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people get to test them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there'll be grateful dog to Arise,
which doesn't even have a name.
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be golden goat to Arise,
which would be like a golden goat bat
[SPEAKER_06]: cross, kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there'll be lemon skunk cross to
Arise, which who knows what that's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of those plants make a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of those plants have a really nice
structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really see a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are currently, the date today is,
I'm pressing my button on my phone,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the 14th.
[SPEAKER_06]: They went into flower on the 3rd,
so they're 11 days in.
[SPEAKER_06]: The male plant is getting big old balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: His balls are starting, you know,
when the male plant starts to flower out,
[SPEAKER_06]: the balls point up, but now they're
starting to hang.
[SPEAKER_06]: His nuts are starting to hang,
which means within the next four to six
[SPEAKER_06]: days, I'm going to have pollen coming out
of there, which may be a little earlier
[SPEAKER_06]: than I wanted.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to move him over to another
room to keep him away from the girls
[SPEAKER_06]: because the girls, their pistols,
the little, you guys call them hairs
[SPEAKER_06]: probably, the little white pistols,
the hairs on the plant that looks like a
[SPEAKER_06]: dandelion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want those nice and thick and stout
before I put that pollen on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to move this boy to another
area just to keep him from dusting his
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen on these girls too early.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once I see all the girls have
their pistols, nice and hairy,
[SPEAKER_06]: nice and furry, almost that tarantula
look, then I'm going to bring the boy over
[SPEAKER_06]: there and I'm going to just leave him in
the room with them overnight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in the morning, as soon as lights
come on, I'm going to give him a little
[SPEAKER_06]: shake and that pollen is just going to
dust all those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm going to do that probably
four or five days again, or four or five
[SPEAKER_06]: days later, I'm going to do that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just let the lights come on and walk in
there and give them a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_06]: shake and just get that pollen all over
all those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I see a little bit of a shake
guys, if you grab a male cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_06]: that is in full flower, that's got pollen
sacks hanging off of it, you can flick it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like listen to, I'm going to flick the
microphone stand.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You flick it that hard, pollen goes
everywhere, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So after that, I'll have to take a shower,
I'll have to change clothes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to go spray down any female
plants that I do not want receiving
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be some work, but it'll be
definitely, definitely worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to change clothes, wash my
dreadlocks before I go to anybody else's
[SPEAKER_06]: garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't disrespect anyone else's garden
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put on specific clothes that cover me
up most of the way so that I can just drop
[SPEAKER_06]: them right in the washer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a chore, but that's where my breeding
project is you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: The male is just getting ready to drop
pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, I just kicked the dog again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to kick you.
[SPEAKER_06]: His head's right here on my foot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every time I get excited, I move my
foot and get a good head kick.
[SPEAKER_06]: This ain't no UFC over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my plants are, the breeding project is
11 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: The males are just dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: The male is just starting to drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: The females are almost ready to take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to separate them for a little
bit just to put some tension in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'm going to reintroduce them
together in a few days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once they pollinate, it's
probably going to be about six weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: before those seeds are ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to let them go about seven
weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to let them go too long,
but I want them nice and done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want them hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will set them all in individual areas
over individual containers and just let
[SPEAKER_06]: them dry for a couple few days.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll pre-trim them at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just take off all the big leaves
when we cut them down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the fan leaves will be gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll hang them, we'll let them dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you just take the plants and you
basically cut one stick off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I put on rubber gloves and hold it
over like a pie plate and just start
[SPEAKER_06]: crushing up the buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can just hear the seeds fall out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you're smoking old school
Mexican brickweed and all those seeds are
[SPEAKER_06]: just going tink, tink, tink, tink,
tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink,
[SPEAKER_06]: tink into the pie plate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just crumble them up with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I push all the weed up to one
side and I tip the pan and all the seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: roll down to the other side and I take
those out and put them in a jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets carefully labeled of what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I leave the lid open for a couple of few
days just so that if there's any moisture
[SPEAKER_06]: in there that those seeds will dry out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I've got a mason jar full of
well-labeled seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once I've got all of them,
I'll weigh the seeds, get a good estimate
[SPEAKER_06]: of how many seeds I've got, and then I'll
send a lot of those seeds out to friends
[SPEAKER_06]: of mine with a note that says,
these are testers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please test these, take a lot of pictures,
make a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know what you got.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will give some to local people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the requirement is if you find a
champion, I get a clone of that sucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got something good, I get a
clone of the best one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of how that goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll give you some tester packs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be probably looking at 12 weeks
before anything will even be done from
[SPEAKER_06]: this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there will be seeds in 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be testers.
[SPEAKER_06]: People will check them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll post pictures of what comes of it,
because I'll grow a bunch of them by
[SPEAKER_06]: myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dog just got up and left because I
kicked him in the head.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys don't ever kick your dog in the
head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love your dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scratch your dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And breed good cannabis.
