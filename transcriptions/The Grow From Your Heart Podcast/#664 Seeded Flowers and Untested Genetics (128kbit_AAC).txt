apologize for the last episode it was not
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the quality of the standards that I
am used to delivering there were a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of technical issues a couple of glitches I
did have to cut out part of that podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making any excuses it's all my
fault but I do apologize it was not what I
[SPEAKER_00]: am used to delivering I will do better
this time and in the future again we're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning new gear sometimes some
equipment's not going to cooperate
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes some memory cards will have a
bad day and things will go wrong we will
[SPEAKER_00]: do our best to work around those things
anyway thank you for all the feedback the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions the corrections the comments and
the concerns from the last episode I do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it and I will do better in the
future where do we go from here new
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise I am working on new
merchandise in a previous episode I did
[SPEAKER_00]: ask for merchandise ideas I wanted your
feedback your input because you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: the people wearing the merchandise playing
with the merchandise rocking the gear
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I have made printed designed you
will be the ones rocking it so I did want
[SPEAKER_00]: your feedback there are some new things
coming some of the merch will take
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 10 to 12 weeks to be printed
and sent to me or designed and built and
[SPEAKER_00]: made and sent to me other things will be
ready in approximately two to four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in a really weird time right now for
ordering things we're coming out of one
[SPEAKER_00]: phase and into another phase and possibly
back to another phase of the world right
[SPEAKER_00]: now buying shipping receiving is weird
there is new merchandise coming thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of the great feedback and input
when I did ask for merchandise ideas you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys did a wonderful guys and gals did a
wonderful job so look forward to new
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise coming that stuff will be on
the website when it is available it will
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up on the I read genetics web store
how can you stay updated and know when the
[SPEAKER_00]: new stuff arrives that's a really good
question all you have to do is go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: website scroll approximately halfway down
there is a spot that you can join the I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics newsletter when you join
that newsletter approximately once a month
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get an update that will let you
know what new merch is available it will
[SPEAKER_00]: let you know what new strains may be
available what coupon codes are active I
[SPEAKER_00]: try to make a new coupon code every month
for either the merchandise store or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: for a vendor stay up to date coupon codes
new drops new merchandise it all comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the newsletter I only try to send them
out about once a month I try not to
[SPEAKER_00]: overload you bombard you with too much
stuff but I do try to keep you updated
[SPEAKER_00]: send you some coupon code some discounts
things like that some news if I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be on a special podcast or do a special
event I try to let you know through the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter so go to the website I read
genetics comm scroll down find the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter section put in your email
address you'll be added to the newsletter
[SPEAKER_00]: and then once a month you will get an
update will let you know what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: my goal is to have this new gear most of
it in stock the new merchandise I'm hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a lot of it here for Black Friday
so we can do a Black Friday sale and get
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys a lot of new gear a lot of people
have been asking for some of the shirt
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes that are sold out I'm going to
replace those I will add new designs try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that here for Black Friday the
stuff that doesn't make it by Black Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to have it for Christmas then
we'll find out what sells well and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: restock that stuff and hopefully have it
for the endo expo so you'll have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for new merchandise stay
tuned things are coming I mentioned the
[SPEAKER_00]: endo expo that's right February February
4th and 5th in Denver I'm gonna grab my
[SPEAKER_00]: phone and rudely here make sure that I'm
telling you the right date because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to give you the wrong date it is
February that is right February nope it's
[SPEAKER_00]: February 5th and 6th in Denver Colorado
that's right the endo expo in Denver join
[SPEAKER_00]: us I read genetics will be at the endo
expo in Denver Colorado February 5th and
[SPEAKER_00]: 6th I'm gonna verify that date one more
time just because I'm really wanting to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to give you the right date the Friday
no it's the Saturday and Sunday is the 5th
[SPEAKER_00]: and 6th that is correct 5 and 6 of
February 2022 I'm not sure if I said the
[SPEAKER_00]: year but February 2022 the endo expo will
be at a different location also if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: used to joining us at the endo expo it
will not be at the Denver Mart this year
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be at the Denver Convention Center
so make your plans accordingly maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments to make there I look forward
to seeing you at the Denver endo expo
[SPEAKER_00]: February 5th and 6th 2022 it feels weird
to say 2022 gotta look over at the phone
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure I'm saying the right date
we're talking about far into the future
[SPEAKER_00]: here join us at the endo expo guys we
should have some cool merch and plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains available alright that is enough
rambling at the top of the show here I do
[SPEAKER_00]: have some cannabis related content that is
what you tuned in for I've got a great
[SPEAKER_00]: question here in front of me alright this
question comes from a friend do they want
[SPEAKER_00]: their name said I don't see their name on
here so I don't think they want their name
[SPEAKER_00]: said let's just keep them safe and
anonymous their question goes a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: this it says I had an intersex plant seed
all of my females are the seeds feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: or are they intersex plants that is a good
question so this grower had a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: they did not notice it was turning
intersex in their garden that is a common
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that does happen and it seeded all
of their female plants now they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of seeds in the garden the main
question is are the seeds that come from
[SPEAKER_00]: this going to be feminized or are they
more intersex seeds that's a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: question a very common question the first
thing I can say is they are not feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: they came from an intersex plant which
means they've got an intersex trait which
[SPEAKER_00]: means you may find more intersex traits in
the offspring you may get some straight
[SPEAKER_00]: females out of there but you may get a
bunch of intersex plants you will not get
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds out of here because they
were not made from a properly reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant with proper feminizing
technique there's more of a method to that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more selection to that fem seeds
are not made from intersex plants if they
[SPEAKER_00]: are then the offspring will display that
intersex trait so the pollen donor on this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was actually an intersex plant which
means you were putting 50 percent of your
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring of the cross of that is intersex
so you're going to get a very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood of intersex plants you do not
have fems they may be intersex but you may
[SPEAKER_00]: find some amazing females I talk a lot
about how some of the most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: prolific strains we smoke and consume and
breed with now were accidents the chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: was an accident sour diesel was allegedly
an accident gorilla glue number four was
[SPEAKER_00]: an accident golden goat was an accident a
lot of the greatest shit we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: were accidents so you may have a bunch of
intersex junk you could have some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: gems or you could have complete trash in
there the best way to find out is to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them don't give them to any friends don't
spread them out don't put these
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially problematic seeds in any other
gardens grow them in your garden pay close
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to them grow them until they're
big enough to get a clone pull a clone off
[SPEAKER_00]: of it that way you've got a keeper that
way if you come up with the next chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a keeper and you don't grow it
one time and get heartbroken get a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it flower it out find out what you've
got you could have like I said before they
[SPEAKER_00]: could all turn intersex right away they
could turn intersex mid flower they could
[SPEAKER_00]: turn intersex late flower pay attention to
every single plant very carefully weed out
[SPEAKER_00]: the junk keep the champions maybe you've
got something amazing run ten or twenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds that's going to tell you a
good idea of what you've got if more than
[SPEAKER_00]: half of them are intersex don't run any
more of them get rid of them is my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you really want to run the risk and
you don't have more seeds to play with
[SPEAKER_00]: those are free seeds those are testers see
what you've got there all right thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for the great message you did not say that
you want your name included so I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say your name here on the show big
shout out you know who you are next time
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to keep an eye on that
intersex plant a little bit better and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you don't get a whole bunch of
seeds hopefully you got some smokable
[SPEAKER_00]: consumable product out of that as well
hopefully you got something to use and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you learned something all right this
question comes from my friend I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: if I should say their name because they
are asking industry questions let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: not single my friend out and say his name
bro thank you for the great question you
[SPEAKER_00]: know who you are I consider you a bro a
friend so this one came from my friend it
[SPEAKER_00]: says I've got a good question from you I
just finished listening to the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: episode and I wanted to get your input on
how you feel about commercial growers
[SPEAKER_00]: using autos and untested genetics all
right so he's asking how I feel about
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cultivation facilities using
auto flower plants and untested genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the states starting to realize
medical and recreational cannabis isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: going away there are a lot of folks with
cash but zero to minimal knowledge on how
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow or even what to look for in a
plant that is absolutely true now that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working in the industry a few
months it's wild how many growers just get
[SPEAKER_00]: clones or seeds from someone and just run
them yeah unfortunately some times that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the option that is the only thing to do it
is just get some seeds or clones and just
[SPEAKER_00]: run them and figure it out you got to
figure it out somehow and yeah it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: much better to run tested genetics but if
you get a clone from somebody even if they
[SPEAKER_00]: ran it and they tested it they ran it and
they tested that's like somebody dating a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl and telling you know she's great bro
you should marry her and you're like you
[SPEAKER_00]: dated or not me maybe it's a different
maybe into different shit you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean so yeah you should do your own
selection but you've got to get your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and clones from someone somewhere so
you've got to use your resources
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in a new emerging market
without a lot of resources let me read
[SPEAKER_00]: more into this and we will talk about
doing selection and things like that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: wild how many growers just get seeds
clones from someone and just run them I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it's a huge time saver
especially for those newly legal states
[SPEAKER_00]: but I find it as an easy way out unless
those growers are explaining that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: working toward creating and finding their
own strains and their medical purposes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the meantime are running some things they
believe it's just the best option until
[SPEAKER_00]: they get their own stuff up and running a
lot of times it's all about where do you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a clone where do you get the plants
everybody's gonna want to have OG Kush on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf everybody wants chem dog sour
diesel bubblegum all the old guys want
[SPEAKER_00]: Acapulco gold Panama red everyone's gonna
have the stuff that they grew up with like
[SPEAKER_00]: around when they were 18 or 19 and they
were smoking that that's what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go to the dispensary and ask for
that's the popular shit if you're younger
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna want sour diesel or Girl
Scout cookies if you're a little older you
[SPEAKER_00]: might ask for white widow if you're even
older you want that fucking Acapulco gold
[SPEAKER_00]: and that older shit so it's all about what
people want but then how do you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: who's got the clone if you're in some new
state that just came legal and there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: a big market and you're not into the
community into the scene if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's got money and passion and
you want to jump into it open up a new
[SPEAKER_00]: weed business you don't know people like
me and you with clones and people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the industry who have cuts of old
air loom stuff so they just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to it they don't have it so they've
got to find some seeds they've got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some clones and just run it because if
another dispensary has OG Kush they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna give it to them because that's how
they're gonna dominate the market and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that want OG Kush are gonna go over
there so it becomes a that's when cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and plants all become kind of that's
when it becomes a huge commodity and more
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable that's when clones become
expensive so now let's talk about just
[SPEAKER_00]: popping seeds popping a bunch of seeds is
how they are going to find something that
[SPEAKER_00]: sets them apart that's how I find strains
and breeding projects and plants that set
[SPEAKER_00]: me apart I pop a bunch of seeds and I find
the champs in there everybody's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone it's a clone that guy's got it that
guy's got it that commercial grows got it
[SPEAKER_00]: that girl's got it everybody has that
clone but if you grow from seed and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't share the clone your commercial
facility could be the only one with that
[SPEAKER_00]: dark hollow cut that tests at 39% THC and
just drips with turps and it trims itself
[SPEAKER_00]: and it puts on a green light when it's
ready for harvest you may find that one in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pack if you find that plant do send me
a clone but you've got to grow from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: to find that hopefully and this is a good
thing to talk about right now at this time
[SPEAKER_00]: of year I did put out a similar episode to
this last year here's something we can
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about if you're going to run untested
stuff run small batches don't run big ass
[SPEAKER_00]: plants of untested genetics run a plant
big enough to get a clone take a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: from that plant sex either the original
plant that grew from seed or that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: just put it into 1212 and flower it long
enough for it to show you if it's a boy or
[SPEAKER_00]: a girl if it's a boy toss it if it's an
intersex plant toss it unless of course
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for a breeding project and
keep that boy no matter what toss the
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex plants when you find the good
females or when you find the females grow
[SPEAKER_00]: those out to flower then dry them cure
them and smoke them and find the females
[SPEAKER_00]: that are most desirable for your grow for
your customers for your clientele for your
[SPEAKER_00]: situation and then continue with that
phenotype but the only way to do it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from seed but you should grow small
tester batches I see people putting giant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants outside and they're we're a couple
weeks into the flowering season now in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few places and people have nine foot tall
male plants outside they're going what's
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with this plant and I'm saying
that's a male plant and you're pollinating
[SPEAKER_00]: everything for miles around if you don't
cut that down soon and why did you spend
[SPEAKER_00]: months and months watering and taking care
of a big-ass plant that we could have
[SPEAKER_00]: found out that was a male months ago and
not wasted the time energy resources a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of places it's illegal so they're up there
growing an illegal plant nurturing it
[SPEAKER_00]: loving it taking pictures posing taking
selfies with it and now they got to cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: down and they were committing felonies and
they don't even have anything to show for
[SPEAKER_00]: it excuse me for the throat clearing but
so let me get back to the original
[SPEAKER_00]: question how do you feel about commercial
growers using autos and untested genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: autos is going to be an option for
everybody and autos are great if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: them from a reliable auto breeder big
shout out to Mephisto seeds they don't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: me to say that I believe those are quality
seeds so autos are always an option for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody if that fits your needs then how
do I feel about untested genetics run a
[SPEAKER_00]: small batch and test them the way to do it
is to have one of the growers maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: lead grower grow the untested stuff at
home if you've got the opportunity the
[SPEAKER_00]: space if things work like that for you do
all the testing in a small area at home
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take that to the commercial grow
later make it like a home project or
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicate some space to R&D because those
untested genetics maybe that's where you
[SPEAKER_00]: find the gems you don't know if they're
hot fire or if they're turds you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's in there yet because they're
untested so if you can dedicate just two
[SPEAKER_00]: five by five areas or four lights or three
lights to just testing you can find a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of good shit in there and you got to do
something man like a lot of people so
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if you were friends and you're a
huge member of the iri army and part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the community imagine if you were just in
the middle of America I'm not even gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: pick a state because then that state will
start emailing me you're just in a state
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't have medical or recreational
cannabis and then you see like hey in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next six months we're going to be opening
dispensaries and commercial grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like I really want to do that and
then like cool here's all your licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff where your plants coming from
you're gonna go I don't know you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to start with something you're gonna
have to be resourceful and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do the best with what you've got
until you can do better so yeah hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: these dispensary grows that you're talking
about are doing some phenol hunts and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just putting out what they can
while they've got it keep in mind bro this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a brand new industry in a lot of places
this is brand new the commercial grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary was all just birthed so it will
only get better hopefully sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate comes in sometimes new rules and
laws come in and kind of squish it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit but I should just get better
especially with strain selections
[SPEAKER_00]: especially as the industry grows and the
competition settles down a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: right now it's just so much competition
that no no other grower no other
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary no other cultivation facility
is going to share elite cuts that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: separates us I said that before like if
you had the magic spell that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to buy would you give the spell to
somebody else so they could make part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the money to where you're just gonna bring
all the money into your business that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just how it's always worked that's why
I've always encouraged phenol hunting
[SPEAKER_00]: through seeds you could find that cultivar
that cut that is just amazing and nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: else ever around you has it because you
found it in a pack of seeds you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: share it don't give a clone out eventually
an employee in the commercial facility
[SPEAKER_00]: will steal it and then it will get out
that's just how it always works but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't share that thing it'll be yours
it'll keep your facility rocking for years
[SPEAKER_00]: to come so let me catch more of this
message there is more to it unless they're
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining they're working in the meantime
yeah they've got to do something bro
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got to run the best option until
they get their shit up and running and it
[SPEAKER_00]: always takes a while to dial it in how is
your first crop how is your second and
[SPEAKER_00]: third crop imagine those crops at scale I
don't know how big the commercial grows
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at our commercial grows in
my mind or at least 50 lights when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start saying 25 lights maybe but like 50
lights to a hundred a hundred is a real
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow that's a big boy grow in
my mind imagine the first run in a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new building with the commercial grow with
the new a new lead cultivator a new staff
[SPEAKER_00]: new equipment a new room new lights
everything is different your first crop
[SPEAKER_00]: the only and especially maybe new plants
like you don't know any of this stuff you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't done it before you've got you know
how to grow you know how to turn on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights turn off the lights water the
plants but everything is new this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new a new vehicle a new fucking race
is a whole new game so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: learning to be done give those grows those
growers the opportunity to get their shit
[SPEAKER_00]: together they're gonna need two or three
grows to fuck it up before they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get it right and then they're gonna get it
right and they're gonna get real cocky I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they figured it out and then the
seasons are gonna change and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna screw up a couple of grows and have
to learn how to grow every season
[SPEAKER_00]: differently that's something they will
overlook all right then it goes on it does
[SPEAKER_00]: say basically what is your view on farmers
running other people's cuts genetics autos
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is somebody else's cuts
genetics autos I don't think that the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial farms should be out there
breeding that is my job I breed they get
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds they find the stuff that works best
for their growth so they've got to run
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else's stuff there are commercial
facilities out there that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: specialize in providing clones for the
commercial market they'll do the work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you find stuff that produces well as
powdery mildew resistant bug resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: puts out good lab tests good bag appeal
they'll find shit and then they'll sell it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the commercial market there are several
facilities that do that so the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: have to come from somewhere just like
breeding that's just like saying do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think a breeder should work with somebody
else's genetics I can't just clap my hands
[SPEAKER_00]: and create new strains to work with it's
got to come from somewhere do you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: those farmers putting in time to find
those strains are getting overlooked
[SPEAKER_00]: because another farmer took someone's word
on a clone the farmers doing the time get
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked no the farmers doing the time
don't get overlooked because they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone that draws everybody to their grow
and we had a rise my cut of a rise was at
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility I would post hey we
just harvested some arise it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to the store tomorrow it would
sell out tomorrow we're the only one that
[SPEAKER_00]: had it so I don't think the farmers get
overlooked they knew it was coming from us
[SPEAKER_00]: and why definitely got my praise because
another farmer took someone's word on a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone yeah if they took someone's word on
it they should run it don't go running a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand of them you should always test
everything and see if it's any good and
[SPEAKER_00]: then always let people know like that's
the this cut that's the arise Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: cut or whatever I don't know if I
completely understand that part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: question but then it does go on it says I
think it's a great strategy for getting
[SPEAKER_00]: started but I do feel that the end goal
for me as a farmer would be breeding two
[SPEAKER_00]: of my own strains together to create my
magnum opus if you will yes that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the ideal goal but in a commercial
environment right now the price and cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis in Colorado has dropped
dramatically right now in a new market I
[SPEAKER_00]: know where you are herb is worth a lot of
money stack some of that money up if you
[SPEAKER_00]: work with the new facility if you're
fucking doing something in that business
[SPEAKER_00]: stack that money up because it's not
always going to be that way new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations will come that's gonna cut out
part of your income you're gonna need new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations you'll need more employees
they're gonna add more packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements all this stuff is gonna start
cutting out of your income then as the
[SPEAKER_00]: market regulates the price will drop it's
going to get very competitive you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get people supplying more product then
people will buy there'll be outdoor grows
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be a lot of indoor grows people
are gonna get good at it prices will drop
[SPEAKER_00]: so what I'm getting at is they have to
sell every single gram that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce my goal as a when I do consulting
for facilities my goal is to go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to maximize production and
minimize costs we've got to spend less and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce more and my job is to figure out
how to do it I basically go in and find
[SPEAKER_00]: leaks where we fucking hemorrhaging money
where can we put some patches and save a
[SPEAKER_00]: few bucks here and a few bucks there
produce better quality and more of it so
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm getting at is they don't have the
room space time money employees manpower
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have the money the funding to
spend a room on creating new strains there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some places that have tried to do that
and may be doing that but it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: uncommon because in this market right now
every not every gram every half gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: flour accounts right now to pay the bills
a pound of weed cost so much to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when you sell a pound of weed to
a market it doesn't make a lot of profit
[SPEAKER_00]: there is not a lot of profit per pound
right now you've got to pay for if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically integrated you've got to pay
for multiple buildings that means you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the commercial facility where you're
producing it you've got the facility where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are turning it into edibles or
topicals or whatever it's being turned
[SPEAKER_00]: into then you've got the dispensary where
it is being distributed you're paying rent
[SPEAKER_00]: for three facilities you're paying three
licenses you're paying three staffs
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a manager a supervisor or whatever
you want to call it at each facility if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the the extraction facility the
edible facility the topical facility
[SPEAKER_00]: that's three managers there's a
cultivation manager maybe two there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary manager then there's a
compliance manager who goes to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those and make sure you're following the
rules then there's a lawyer then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: an accountant then there's a payroll
person there are so many people to pay is
[SPEAKER_00]: what i'm trying to say that there's no
profit right now in legal cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: colorado it's very very very low margins
is what i'm trying to say so at this time
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no room no space no desire to
breed seeds in a commercial facility
[SPEAKER_00]: that's got to be done by guys like myself
who are not relying on every gram to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: the light bill because i don't have a trim
crew of like nine people who if i get if
[SPEAKER_00]: my business closes the lead cultivator the
uh the consultants the uh who's the person
[SPEAKER_00]: the compliance manager the trim crew the
metric person all those people don't lose
[SPEAKER_00]: their job so it's a lot uh it's a lot
different to think about i should be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding those places should be
producing just mass quantities of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: herb that they can i do appreciate and uh
enjoy and admire your goal of breeding two
[SPEAKER_00]: strains together to create your magnum
opus but you'll understand quickly that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to take you years it's going
to take a very very long time when i was
[SPEAKER_00]: working in commercial facilities sometimes
they would give me uh they would afford me
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity and bless me with a little
bit of space to run one or two lights of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and do some hunting in there and
then the idea was that they would get to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the winter and i would get to use
their facility for research so we'd run a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred seeds and then in the end we'd
pick one keeper out of that batch of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred i would get to take photos and
notes and do a hundred seeds under their
[SPEAKER_00]: grow i would have a staff running it on
the weekend so other people could mess
[SPEAKER_00]: with it i could take the weekends off and
do a normal life and then at the end i got
[SPEAKER_00]: all the data all the reports all the
photos and they got to keep the winter and
[SPEAKER_00]: then quite often i would end up with the
clone of that winter plant as well but it
[SPEAKER_00]: does take a lot of time and a lot of work
to breed especially in a cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility then how are you not going to
pollinate everything if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a cross in there you got a male plant
in your commercial facility that's that
[SPEAKER_00]: much time that you can't flower without
pollinating something if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: careful so that does make a struggle all
right it does say i don't know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: where i was going with this but maybe this
will be a good topic and you can give me
[SPEAKER_00]: more insight how it is in colorado i think
i did kind of ramble and bring this into
[SPEAKER_00]: colorado as well so that was a great topic
as i'm thinking about visiting colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: when i have some extra funds i'd love to
say hello if i pass through your area i
[SPEAKER_00]: would almost be offended if you don't say
hello and if you don't pass through my
[SPEAKER_00]: area come by say what's up would love to
meet you shake your hand say what's up
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a fist bump dab you out get you
so high you're uncomfortable all right
[SPEAKER_00]: that is all i've got for this episode the
battery meter on this camera just turned
[SPEAKER_00]: red so i better hurry up and wrap this
shit up ladies and gentlemen boys and
