[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 159 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, my friends call me Ross
DeJeffin, and I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout to Kat Kood and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is part two of
the last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost said last week's episode,
but it'll still be this week because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to put these out back to back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't make you wait too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple, maybe three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little late.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is back sitting across the table from
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just stepped outside for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike had a couple of cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping it quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome back.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually 158.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to call it 159 to keep the
feed going.
[SPEAKER_03]: 158.5 part two, some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So dude, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, it's getting a little bit chilly out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike and I just hung outside while Mike
had a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting a little bit crispy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had a hoodie while I was out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you outdoor growers, your shit's going
to get purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to be carrying a jacket
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my friends that are sleeping outside,
they're outdoor grow I feel for you right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as comfortable as it was last
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the heavy bag out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to start a campfire
or some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you got your dog out there keeping
you warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: No campfire.
[SPEAKER_03]: No campfire?
[SPEAKER_03]: Light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that light?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the right kind of light?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the right kind of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, hopefully you're warm outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you're listening to this while
you're trimming down your outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just about croptober.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dependent on where you're living.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming down now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what strain you're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got some flow or some blueberry,
it might be time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not coming down while you're
listening to this, you better be flushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, flushing for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put this train wreck of a podcast
back on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only two minutes and 30 seconds in
and we're already rambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is part two of
an episode that we did a few... Actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: we recorded it like an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an email and it started off with
questions for Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a part two that had
questions about going from a basement grow
[SPEAKER_03]: into a large facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me catch you up on the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read it all the way from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, Hey, what's up, Rasta Jeff,
huge fan of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I've said before, I had a few questions
I thought could be a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in Michigan and we just passed three
bills pushing us into a seed to sale
[SPEAKER_03]: system based on Colorado system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you and white Mike
could touch on the subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how do I go about finding out
information from the city about how many
[SPEAKER_03]: license facilities they will allow?
[SPEAKER_03]: That part we handled on the last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you listen to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, press pause, go back, listen to
number 158 and check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then come back and see us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the second part of the question,
what we're going to address today,
[SPEAKER_03]: he says, what is the biggest hurdle going
from a basement grow to a warehouse?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've recently made the switch
from soil to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any advice on that transition?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he also says, I'm planning on using
veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already in the basement, but do you
add anything else to their line as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some things you didn't expect
going to a large scale and any other
[SPEAKER_03]: advice you think one would need to know
about taking the leap into the big
[SPEAKER_03]: leagues?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, thanks for such a great
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you can answer some questions for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already answered half of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into the second half of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The part where I need to jump in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Mike, thanks for doing such a great
job with the first half of this dude's
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really fucking nailed it for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need further elaboration on any
point, hit me up on social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love hearing from all of you,
from everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love listener generated content.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an amazing question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to do a two-parter episode to
answer it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send me your emails, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get into the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I didn't say last episode, thanks again
for the killer question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get two hours worth of
content out of this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, where is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the biggest hurdle going from a
basement grow to a warehouse?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of things to think about
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the biggest things that I noticed
was different was the airflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: A large building, the air doesn't flow
like it does in a small room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can change the air out in a small
bedroom in a matter of minutes with a
[SPEAKER_03]: small blower.
[SPEAKER_03]: A large room, you're going to have hot
spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have cool spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to find humid spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need to learn how to
control that temperature and that humidity
[SPEAKER_03]: all throughout a large room.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scale of the increase is where many
legal retailers and production facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: are still problem shooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their multimillion dollar grows because
the difference in scope from a basement
[SPEAKER_02]: grow or a smaller grow to a huge warehouse
is monumental.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good reliable HVAC company in Colorado
that will come work on a grow and knows
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're doing will make you wait
three months just to come give you an
[SPEAKER_03]: estimate because they are so backed up
with cannabis grows right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had enough money to do anything I
wanted cannabis business wise,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would build from the ground up because
I've seen what so many companies have had
[SPEAKER_02]: to go through attempting to improve an
existing structure to where it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: giving them problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know so many people that they thought
they had everything under control and then
[SPEAKER_02]: as the season started to change,
the temperature change in that wall was
[SPEAKER_02]: causing major problems in a grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a unique problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're one wall, whichever side gets
the most sun or the least sun,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just depends on your environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the seasons change in Colorado,
you'll usually see in a grow that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: never been in before, you have to find out
where the powdery mildew is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen when the first winter comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to find out where it's going
to happen because it probably will.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't designed your room
flawlessly on one wall, you're probably
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get powdery mildew there when the
seasons change.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I can problem shoot a basement
grow or a bedroom grow in 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_02]: an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: By troubleshoot, I mean find the problems
and suggest easy ways to fix them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can walk into a basement grow and point
out 10 things in 10 seconds that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: improve your grow and make it more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a warehouse grow, part of it's just
putting in the time to get through the
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles to see where your huge issues are
going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we get enough heating and cooling,
a lot of people don't aim for enough
[SPEAKER_03]: cooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't think they're going to need
enough cooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they put plenty of cooling or they
don't think about enough airflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to evacuate humidity out of
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are things I would say to look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know outfits that spent more on AC units
than they did on building.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on the building.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one outfit in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that's true for a half dozen or
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just happen to know the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The airflow is going to be a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you're going to be feeding on a much
larger scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to build a drip system?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be watering by hand?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time you run that drip system,
you're creating more humidity in the room
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're going to have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time you water by hand, there's
going to be more humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a drain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a floor drain?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I would definitely look
for if you're moving into a new building,
[SPEAKER_03]: a floor drain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Treating water is a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're moving into a warehouse,
at the green and healthy warehouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: we used about a thousand gallons of water
every other day-ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need to treat that
somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would recommend a really nice reverse
osmosis machine because something I
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed was we were using the water that
came from the municipality- No more
[SPEAKER_02]: buckets and bubblers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scale is what we're getting at here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about a basement grow,
you're talking about one employee,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about a thousand dollars
worth of equipment, a little warehouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: you multiply those numbers by a hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get back into this part.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were using the municipal water from
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the temperature would change,
the smell of the water would change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could smell chlorine in it on some days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could smell other things on some days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would do a simple pH test.
[SPEAKER_03]: On some days, the pH would be seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some days, it would be nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just be days apart from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I would do PPM tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, it'd be really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, it would be really,
really low.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're feeding cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our plants are in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really hard to predict what water
you're going to get tomorrow or the next
[SPEAKER_03]: day so an RO machine would really be
really helpful in a large grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I would highly recommend
because you're going to need clean water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have more RO water than you think you're
going to need available because if you get
[SPEAKER_03]: too much heat- That's anywhere in the
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guaranteed there's stuff in your municipal
water that you do not want to feed to your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants or through your watering system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get a problem like bugs or powdery
mildew, you're going to have a larger
[SPEAKER_03]: problem than you have ever thought of
having because hopefully, you're running a
[SPEAKER_03]: perpetual growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a large system and you're going
to have plants that are in full flower at
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of flower and you can't treat
those for bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be highly prepared for pests and pathogens
and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be on the lookout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bring anybody into that grow unless
it is absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get clones from somewhere but
when clones come in, quarantine them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Treat the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost kill them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're treating them so hard for pests and
mold because you don't want to bring any
[SPEAKER_03]: of that stuff in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of facilities that they've
given up trying to treat clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're seed only now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a few outfits that have just given
up entirely and I know a lot of home
[SPEAKER_02]: growers that that's been their policy
since the last time they got a gift clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scheduling and getting everything on track
in a big grow is a challenge in the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning unless you're a guy like myself
that is OCD.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need to get a good
schedule happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need to get veg plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're going to need flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're going to need clones and
you're going to need to keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_03]: these flowering plants are going to be
done in this amount of time and I need
[SPEAKER_03]: this many veg plants to replace them
immediately because you do not want
[SPEAKER_03]: downtime.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to kind of segue me into
something that I can really rant about
[SPEAKER_03]: personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hugest caveat of going from the
basement to a warehouse grow is often the
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship between the money person and
the actual grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes there's a middle man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have an investor,
you're going to have an owner,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're going to have a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure which position you're
planning on taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please get all of those people on the same
page because I see a lot of grows fail
[SPEAKER_03]: because an investor throws down money and
he wants money back in 60 days because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're growing weed, where's my money?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got an owner that's rubbing
his balls to keep him off you for a little
[SPEAKER_03]: while and he's like, give me 120 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the owner will say, how long do you
need to grow this crop?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the crops that I'm trying to
grow take me, I'm going to say 150 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need 150 days to make this crop happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The owner of that facility is going to
look you dead in the face and go,
[SPEAKER_03]: cool, I'll see you in 120 days and it
should be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're saying to yourself,
these are fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't cut 30 days off of this cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got an investor bitching in an
owner, an owner yelling at a grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: a grower that wants to do the absolute
best he can for these plants because
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where the passion is, but the
owner's got to make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got to return the investment and then
you've got an investor that only cares
[SPEAKER_03]: about the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hardest part of a commercial grow is
getting all of your people on the same
[SPEAKER_03]: page.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need your owner, your investor,
your master grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need whoever else you've got in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got somebody working the bedroom
and the flower room, those two people need
[SPEAKER_03]: to have a meeting every couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a trim crew, your master
grower and your assistant grower and your
[SPEAKER_03]: trim crew leader all need to communicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to know what plants are coming
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to know how long you have to trim
this until there's more plants so that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can schedule for the trimmers to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are some of the things that you may
overlook.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scale and the scope are so much more
complicated than a basement grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a basement grow, you're getting ready
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You check out your plants every couple of
days for a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they get to where you want them,
you just start harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you call a buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you make a little plan and have two
friends coming over.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about an industrial
scale, you're talking about like 15 or 20
[SPEAKER_02]: people that need to be scheduled,
paid, w2, trained.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe two or three people could run.
[SPEAKER_03]: One or two people can run a hundred light
grows efficiently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two or three people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it comes time to trim,
then you need a small trim crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need five or six people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you need that trim crew
manager.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that assistant grower now becomes
also the trim crew manager, but you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to need somebody that can delegate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a director that can direct the
facility, that can direct the employees,
[SPEAKER_03]: that knows about the plants, that knows
about people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need, like I said in the last
episode, a lawyer and an accountant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are some things that you're
definitely going to need in a larger grow
[SPEAKER_03]: that you didn't think as much about in the
other grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, shit goes wrong every day in a large
scale grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times, investors don't
necessarily know any of that, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: where a lot of headaches and a lot of
partnerships break up is the money man
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't know anything about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: They doesn't realize that something so
simple is when we were doing trimmer
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews, we walked like a dude through
the grow and we think he gave us thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why this crop is a third smaller
than it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff that comes up because you're
dealing with plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're dealing with a live plant in a
medium where mistakes can mean millions in
[SPEAKER_02]: lost revenue or delays.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really can't get it out enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scope is so much different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The attitude and the skill sets are
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest traits for a basement
grower is secrecy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ability to hide and stay hidden.
[SPEAKER_02]: That keeps people with shotguns away from
your door, whether they be law enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: or rippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the biggest skill sets you
can have as a basement grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a legal marijuana business owner,
you need to be very out front,
[SPEAKER_02]: loud and proud about what you do,
how you do it and the fact that you love
[SPEAKER_02]: to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to follow the rules and I make sure
all of my employees love to follow the
[SPEAKER_02]: rules needs to become your mantra.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get used to saying it in front
of TV cameras, especially if you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: be one of the first marijuana business
owners in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, we have somebody that's known
as a compliance officer and his only job
[SPEAKER_03]: is to make sure that you're following all
of the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we have the MED, the Marijuana
Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets emails from them every day saying
that you know that this is a new rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a new rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his job to go, whether it's the
retail or the grow or the extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: facility, it's his job to get the
employees together and say, this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has to oversee that that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rule changes like that are frequent
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until nationwide, we really get
legalization handed out or hammered out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be common in your area too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, I'm sure that we did an
entire episode on going from a basement
[SPEAKER_03]: grower to a large scale grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure that we did an entire
episode on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will leave that in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a link to that in the show
notes or if you go to the website,
[SPEAKER_03]: iregioneticscolorado.com and scroll
through the shows, I'm sure you'll be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to find it on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot recall the episode number right
now and I do not want to scroll through
[SPEAKER_03]: old episodes while we're recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole episode about moving from a
basement grower to a large scale grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we haven't really
hit that you have available now that
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't available to us when we started
this is you can come to Colorado now and
[SPEAKER_02]: hire a consultant or go visit a couple of
legal businesses and see how they do it
[SPEAKER_02]: and get an idea of what is going to be
required of you and where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a number of people out here in
Colorado have been hired to travel out to
[SPEAKER_02]: other states and help people navigate some
of the things like planning out warehouse
[SPEAKER_02]: grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the logistics that go into these
things will blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of cooling that's required for
a one-story warehouse grow is typically
[SPEAKER_02]: greater than a 30-story office building.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of equipment that's necessary
is just insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning how to maintain all of that
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about pot growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know how to grow pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of information that needs to be
learned and adapted to is monumental.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that I quickly learned is
I'm not just a pot grower anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned how to build drip systems with
PVC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned how to work on pumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned how to work on air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned how to work on dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know how to work on the security
camera system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know how to build shit that I never
thought I would and it's just all because
[SPEAKER_03]: I went and helped with a giant commercial
facility and I learned a ton of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need such a varied skill set because
little things that don't have anything to
[SPEAKER_02]: do with growing marijuana can affect your
legal ability to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see a camera down in the grow and
you ignore it, you might get hit with a
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance violation because that camera
was down for an extra half day and have
[SPEAKER_02]: your business shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got more parts of this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to harp on the one part for
too long because the last episode got long
[SPEAKER_03]: that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I just say harp on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez, how old am I getting?
[SPEAKER_03]: He also said, I know you've recently made
the switch from soil to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any advice on that transition?
[SPEAKER_03]: He also says, I'm planning on running Veg
Bloom and I'm already in a basement,
[SPEAKER_03]: but do you add anything else to the Veg
Bloom line as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a multi-part question there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made the switch from soil to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any advice on that transition?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use an easy cloner and I take my clones
from the easy cloner and I put them into
[SPEAKER_03]: solo cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: The solo cups have got holes in the bottom
of them so that they can drain plenty of
[SPEAKER_03]: water and the water doesn't get stuck in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually fill the cups with an aerated
soil, something like Fox Farms,
[SPEAKER_03]: either Ocean Forest or the Happy Frog and
then I put the clones into there and then
[SPEAKER_03]: I water them with my desired nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did so this time, but I used cocoa
instead of the aerated soil and 50% of my
[SPEAKER_03]: clones died.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fucking hated going into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not happy about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cocoa seems to have compressed and
smothered them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not get a chance to get their
legs and they got crushed and killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: My thought on that is put your clones into
soil if that's what you're doing because
[SPEAKER_03]: they did not like the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go into cups of dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put those cups of dirt into the cocoa in
the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've learned because my plants
were really, really pissed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go dirt clones to cocoa plants
easy enough, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just drop them right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to give it time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't mind the transition once those
roots strengthen up a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the weight of the water in that cocoa
compressed the cocoa real tight on those
[SPEAKER_03]: new roots and they just got crushed in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing that I learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you can water a whole heck of a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feed more frequently is what I
think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't water a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feed a heck of a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was running soil, I would feed
maybe twice a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, every time I am watering the plants,
they are getting nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three, maybe four times a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: These plants are getting nutrients and
they don't show any signs of burn and they
[SPEAKER_03]: are growing vigorously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the cocoa not holding your newts as
well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cocoa, it doesn't hold on at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nutrients just slide right out of
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you don't get as much burn and you
can feed more frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll eat what it wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better for your plants, but not your
wallet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe in the end it'll pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking if it's going to eat that
much, there's going to be that much more
[SPEAKER_03]: weight that'll make up for it,
which isn't a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to do some math.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I'm thinking, I don't know if
I'm convinced on 100% cocoa, I may start
[SPEAKER_03]: doing a 50% soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, not an expensive soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like Roots Organic or maybe even
Tupper or the Fox Farm Ocean Forest
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't hurt my feelings.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 50% mix with the soil-less mix and
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the cocoa in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a couple of people that started
doing that a while ago and they all seem
[SPEAKER_02]: to rave about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try that next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, I'll run one light with the cocoa,
one light with the soil, and then one
[SPEAKER_03]: light with the cocoa soil mix and we'll
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I feel about the soil to
cocoa switch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I've noticed if I overwater,
they take really long to dry out and the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants will kind of slow down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I could water the shit out of
them with the cocoa, but I've noticed that
[SPEAKER_03]: I want some aeration in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I overwater them, they really start to
get stagnant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants really like that aeration.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like air.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed that right when they start to
dry out is when they really take off with
[SPEAKER_03]: the most explosive growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're getting kind of dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only ever seen one good aeroponic
system in motion and I was blown away with
[SPEAKER_02]: this dude's timelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next part of his question,
he said, I'm planning on running VegBloom
[SPEAKER_03]: and then he said, do you add anything else
to their line as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I've got a screenshot here of a
conversation I had with a rep from
[SPEAKER_03]: VegBloom and he says, this is what we are
recommended to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said four to five grams of base
nutrient per gallon in veg, five grams per
[SPEAKER_03]: gallon in flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got your base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the HD or the RO or the
dirty, whichever one they selected for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you had a consultation with them
and had your water checked out because if
[SPEAKER_03]: you get your water tested, send them water
test results, they will recommend a base
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But four to five grams of base per veg or
per gallon in veg, five grams per gallon
[SPEAKER_03]: in your flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he says a half of gram per gallon of
plus life once a week and that's their
[SPEAKER_03]: rooting inoculate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plus life, I really like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half a gram per gallon of plus life once a
week through veg and flour and then taper
[SPEAKER_03]: that off in late flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like around week four or five,
you can start pulling that back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he says, shine starting in week
three.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the beginning of week three,
add shine, put one gram, one to two grams
[SPEAKER_03]: per gallon of water is what he says.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shine starting in week three,
one gram to two grams per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can kind of increase that a
little bit as time goes on from what I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So week three, do a gram to two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Week four, increase it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Week five, increase it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six and seven, increase it a little bit
and then start flushing from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he says, push foliar feed every
five to six days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I would cut out the push foliar
feed, maybe spray it one time at the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning of week five and then pull off
of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says the push foliar to spray 50
milliliters per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe if you've got a small crop,
just mix up a half gallon and put 25 mills
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think that pHing that water before
you spray it may help you, but be careful
[SPEAKER_03]: what you use to pH because you don't want
to go killing off the live, there's silica
[SPEAKER_03]: acid, there's calcium and there's C-kelp
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be careful what you're using to adjust
the pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you asked if I add anything to that
mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I put a little bit of osa-28 in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to add some potassium silicates to
the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is the plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes them a little bit more robust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once about every once a week,
once every 10 days ish, I'll hit them with
[SPEAKER_03]: either hybrids or carbo load just to speed
up some carbohydrates in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: put a little bit of a boost in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I add to the Veg Bloom mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too expensive that way and it is
highly efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll put some shine on your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll make them beefy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll taste good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be high in THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will have quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I add to the Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also said you're already there in a
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some things you didn't expect
going into such a large scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was expected to put out a specific
amount of cannabis in a specific amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: time and I didn't know that there would be
obstacles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't expect that there would be a
problem every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you walk into a large commercial
grow, when I would train new people,
[SPEAKER_03]: we trained a few new guys and they said,
so what's the first thing we do when we
[SPEAKER_03]: get in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everyone's excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing we got to do is find what
fucked up last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, there's so many moving
parts that something in here just broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny how- And that's the size
and scope thing I was hitting at earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any grow, you need to keep an eye on
the moving parts, your timers,
[SPEAKER_02]: your plugs, your pumps, your hoses,
connections, all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bigger you grow, the more those
equipment checks eat up into your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about a hundred light
or a 500 light massive warehouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: checking to make sure none of your drip
system plugs have come loose and are
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying water towards your ballast wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes half a day sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent honestly the first half of my
shift when I would walk into the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first hour would just be making sure
that none of the cloners are clogged.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the sprinkler system is clogged.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the pumps are clogged.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the breakers have flipped.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the fans are on.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the dehumidifiers were running and
none of the filters were clogged.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would seriously spend an hour checking
all of that equipment just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a text message back from a buddy of
mine maybe a month ago that read,
[SPEAKER_02]: can't talk, half the lights didn't come on
this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a two sentence way to let
me know he can't talk right now and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be busy all goddamn day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until he figures this shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a half million dollars and the
fire's getting closer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really neat in our industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We run multimillion dollar grow facilities
that are responsible for ... I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: bragging.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Facebook, the owner of the facility I
was growing for posted one time that I
[SPEAKER_03]: pulled 320 something and a fraction pounds
of cannabis from 85 lights, which is three
[SPEAKER_03]: point something pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember where the hell I was
headed with.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that much product being grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: 300 and something pounds at somewhere
between 18 and $2,200 a pound,
[SPEAKER_03]: approximately $2,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had 300 of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Times $2,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: I produced that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we rely on 10 and $12 timers that
could fuck everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it really funny that we've got this
$8 timer from Lowe's that makes all of
[SPEAKER_03]: this get fed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that one timer fucks up, the whole
facility does not get water for a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a basement, your timer screws up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't notice it for three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: One grower's out 6,000, 8,000,
depending on how bad the problem got
[SPEAKER_02]: before it got found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing happens in an industrial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's out several million and
everybody getting fired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole dispensary that now has to
go buy retail weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, and take this a step further.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 365 days in a year and a shitload
of fucking holidays.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be with your home,
with your family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's got to be at the grow every day
to make sure all your lights went off.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started at Green and Healthy
Wellness- Pumps are spraying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm no longer there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if everybody listens to every
episode, but I no longer work at Green and
[SPEAKER_03]: Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not involved in a large scale
production facility at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pursuing my own endeavors right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I was at Green and Healthy
Wellness, for the first crop, I did not
[SPEAKER_03]: take a day off.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first harvest was, we were in flower
for nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lemon G went for 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a little bit of veg
time before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not take a day off for 79 or 84-ish
days because somebody had to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that I did not expect,
but I was willing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be even tangentially involved
with the legal industry before the lazy
[SPEAKER_02]: stoner stereotype evaporates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the amount of work put in,
the industrial grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the legal industry in Colorado,
we did a billion in sales last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do like 1.2 this year,
maybe more.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of days, like 12, 15 hour days
that people around the state put in to
[SPEAKER_02]: make that true is just astronomical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I spend a billion dollars in my
lifetime?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to buy a country and people are
running.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do it in like six hours on hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do it in four minutes on drum
gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I come to that party?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine the drum kit I'd build.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't decide which color, but just buy
them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get one of every...
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you make that step from gray market
or the basement up into the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, everything changes in ways that
you can't predict or imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you guys that are listening to
this are lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learned this shit the hard way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I got to jump in and talk about
an ad, something I did not expect that was
[SPEAKER_03]: overwhelming, harvesting, drying,
and curing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not fucking prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need space for however much bud you've
got growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need that much room for hanging buds
basically because you can't just crush it
[SPEAKER_03]: all together because it's going to get
funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a climate controlled room for
drying and curing that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something I totally did not plan
properly for when I was at Green and
[SPEAKER_03]: Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people try to put a football
field size grow room into a bathroom size
[SPEAKER_02]: drying area and it's like, dude,
you're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That air is going to get stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the humidity is stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need somewhere for the freshly cut
buds to be, for the older buds to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a drying and curing, hanging,
trimming system that is sufficient for
[SPEAKER_03]: your space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you work on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing any size grow,
the best thing you can do to ensure
[SPEAKER_02]: success is to plan upfront.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about the size and
scope in the legal industry, that's
[SPEAKER_02]: astronomically important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen little oversights lead to
multimillion dollar fuck ups and
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses collapsing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just silly, stupid decisions or
little things that people overlook.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cooling thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen multimillion dollar grows sit
idle half the year because there isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: physically enough cooling on site to run
during the hottest months of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the business just needs to make
another 300 grand before they can buy an
[SPEAKER_02]: air conditioner big enough to cool their
whole space.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like having a dope, like a Ferrari
or a rocket or a Tesla, but missing parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to keep working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen other grows just say,
fuck it and grow when it's way too hot and
[SPEAKER_02]: put out a super airy product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just have it all blasted
into hatch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited that the winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get free air cooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just filter that air that comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, you don't want to bring in air.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to bring in ice crystals
and fungus from outside, but filter that
[SPEAKER_03]: air.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature swing and the giant
concrete wall that you didn't think about
[SPEAKER_02]: once while you were planning, causing
massive powdery milty and mold growth
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the temperature swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many people didn't see that
coming in their original plans?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you heat a foot and a half
thick concrete wall?
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved into one house that had a basement
with one concrete exterior wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first time that I grew in that
basement in the winter, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: White rhino plant, like a five ounce
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like a frosted Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got all funked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched another guy, what he thought
were the best plants in the harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we finally got back to him,
the section of wall that they were up
[SPEAKER_02]: against was ice cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were, I mean, it was the craziest
looking pink mold I've ever seen,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I mean, just foulness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was because of the temperature
swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you multiply that, I mean,
that was like maybe a $400 loss to that
[SPEAKER_02]: grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that wasn't an industrial setting,
it'd be $400,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have just kept going right down
that row.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are a lot of things that you can
look out for and you can expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also said any other advice you could,
you may think one would need knowing about
[SPEAKER_03]: taking a leap into the big leagues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep a positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, every day you're going to
walk into that grill and you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: find some bullshit and you can either
freak out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can throw your arms up in the air and
you can be like, ah, what the fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: happened in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can kick some buckets and you can
throw some shit around and make more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can go get the fucking mop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can mop it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure out where that pump broke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get some PVC pipe and a saw and fix all
that shit that you got to fix and just put
[SPEAKER_03]: some glue on it and hope it doesn't break
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you still got work to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants need to be grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit's going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I can say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep a positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your head up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also pay attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you're getting paid what you
deserve to be paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's some shit in the grow that
can be done today, do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't wait until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never in the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, little things that you can get
away with at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sometimes for weeks at a time,
you can get away with at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not fly in an industrial setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much less room for error.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things are going to stack up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to think I've got eight hours
worth of work to do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll knock that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do eight hours worth of work
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: While you're doing eight hours worth of
work today, something's going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's prepared for the level of work at
Harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to you're going to
have to go and clean up something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you've got nine hours worth of
work to do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to say, I'm not going to
get this last part done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now tomorrow you've got nine hours worth
of work to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else is going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's going to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's going to call.
[SPEAKER_03]: A piece of equipment is going to break.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to take a poop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's going to take a little extra
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to go to the store
and pick up a part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now your nine hour day just turned into a
10 hour day and you don't even get a lunch
[SPEAKER_03]: break.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're hungry and grouchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you go home and try to take
care of your plants, they're going to look
[SPEAKER_03]: like shit and it's just going to keep
catching up with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's some shit you can do today,
do it today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweep that shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spray whatever you got to spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean up that dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be looking out for pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look out for mildew every day and just be
prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get you some Method 7 so you don't go
blind.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably one of the best things I
could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good sunglasses and sleeves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Method 7s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your skin covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that covers a whole bunch,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy asked a whole bunch of great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically gave you like the $5,000
consult fee in an episode and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send donations to my email.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I think that's all that we've got for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, I hope you can answer some
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think we handled that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you want more information on any
part of that, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this applies to a lot more than
just the guy asking the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So feel free to shoot us further questions
at the email Jeff keeps giving you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear, I love generating,
I love creating listener generated
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I know I'm giving you what you
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you went to the restaurant and
you ordered exactly what you wanted and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was able to whip that up like the chef and
bring it out to you and serve it hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super fresh for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So send me email
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really easy to get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I check that email very frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes to my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It jingles in my pocket when you send me
an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So send me a message.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear from you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, tell everyone how they can find you
on social media so that they can go stalk
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for
Sensible Cannabis Laws or on Twitter at
[SPEAKER_02]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you come up with that, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've literally had it since 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I was 15, that's where the 15 comes
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nemo is just no one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that when I was 15 and then punk
because I was 15 and I thought it was
[SPEAKER_02]: cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six years later, Finding Nemo comes out
and I was like, meh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just never got around to changing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went to create a Twitter handle,
it was like, do you want to use the
[SPEAKER_02]: hotmail account you've had since you were
15?
[SPEAKER_02]: I clicked sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're at 159 episodes in and I'm
stuck with it.

[SPEAKER_03]: I had an account.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about 20,000 and they deleted me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took me down, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it because now none of my,
no, I can't say none, but my followers are
[SPEAKER_03]: not bots and I'm not following a bunch of
bullshit accounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of got to refresh or restart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cleaner.

little cloud.
