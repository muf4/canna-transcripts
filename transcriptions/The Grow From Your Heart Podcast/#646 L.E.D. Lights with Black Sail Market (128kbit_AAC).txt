from your heart podcast in this episode My
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Keith from black sale market is
going to join us to teach us about LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting before we get to that part of the
show Let's do a few shout outs to a few of

[SPEAKER_00]: description to make it nice and easy for
all of my friends Alright, I'm sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: were excited about this LED lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste too much time So I'm
going to fade out the music fade out the
[SPEAKER_00]: video and when we get back I will be
joined by my friend Keith from black sale
[SPEAKER_00]: market Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got my buddy Keith joining us from
black sale market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show Keith Hey,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us I do appreciate you
being here before we go too far on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show Do you want to tell people how they
can stalk you on social media and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: how they can find your website?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, absolutely, man well,
first of all, my name is Keith and I'm the
[SPEAKER_01]: owner founder CEO HMF IC of the one of the
most badass LED companies in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: Called black sale market calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can find black sale market
calm on Instagram or cannabis at black
[SPEAKER_01]: sale market and then Every Thursday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm now co-hosting the embracing organics
show on YouTube Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna give you a big shout out and a
big thank you for co-hosting EO I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: a part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm like the host or I'm a
panelist on the show I've been involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with the show for quite a while and to
watch the changes happen I'm proud of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have picked it up and who are
continuing The torch and keeping the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see changes and improvements coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm proud of you, bro Thank you for
keeping that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see you stepping up in the chat We
have I see you trying to kind of be a
[SPEAKER_00]: leader and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and To Nasi and I have hired a roles
from really doing their big part and also
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody else on the panel You know,
we lost dirt man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Danny just had some some important life
shit We had to take care of so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know somebody had to step up and keep
the show going like the question Was are
[SPEAKER_01]: we gonna have an episode this week and
that first week?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're gonna have an episode I don't
care if nobody else shows up and Actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know if you guys feel like watching a
trainwreck in slow motion me and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: really happy when Jeff showed up because I
was about ready to just do the damn thing
[SPEAKER_00]: on my own Yeah, I got your back bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man but yeah, we've had three
weeks to work on it and we're coming up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a format and you know We want to keep
the show the same kind of fun hangout
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot shit that it's always been and just
give it a little more structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know And and try to have everybody be
a little bit more prepared And that way
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really easy to get still in this
fucking talk if you've really got some
[SPEAKER_00]: notes prepared, you know, exactly Yeah,
have a few bullet points and just stumble
[SPEAKER_00]: right on down the list I think you guys
are doing a great job not to just single
[SPEAKER_00]: you out the big shout out to To Nasi and
of course him hire Dave big respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody doing it But yeah, man,
I love that you guys are stepping up and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping it going because when I heard that
Dan had to step down I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh there goes a great show because you
guys have a beautiful audience and a great
[SPEAKER_00]: community So it's heartbreaking to watch
that to watch that go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, bro I do appreciate that you
guys make sure you check out embracing
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Thursday nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the mountain time zone So for me it
is 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain time they go for about two hours
Join the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for embracing organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you missed the live show It is all up
there forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back and watch Probably two
years three years worth of episodes quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a few episodes up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the show where Keith and I
Kind of pulled one off and just put it
[SPEAKER_00]: together real quick or you can see some
shows with a lot of great guests We've had
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of cool people on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Jodri Coots been on there a lot of
great breeders a lot of great people So
[SPEAKER_00]: check it out you guys embracing organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about my podcast since we
got you on my show, bro I love it that
[SPEAKER_00]: your your light is called The cannon it
fits perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I switched to using cannons I went from
HPS lights to cannons and I love it So I
[SPEAKER_00]: think calling it a cannon is perfect
because it the first time I plugged it in
[SPEAKER_00]: dude I looked away like oh, no,
I blinked I put my hands up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like I was getting assaulted by
light So it's a cannon, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got shot in the face with so much light
the first time I plugged it in I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: expect that I knew it would be bright,
but it was like oh it was offensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: assaulting and it's amazing so Yeah,
that's that's no that's what the light guy
[SPEAKER_00]: did he got me with the light and then he
pirated me So I love the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of great performance from
my lights I know what my plants are doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know that I understand why so
I brought you on to kind of teach me about
[SPEAKER_00]: my new lights Let you teach the audience
about LED lights I'll let you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: teach me the basics You always talk about
the McCree curve and you talk about a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of scientific stuff that honestly When it
comes to growing I understand the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're people I talked to the plants
like they're people I pet them like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pets and animals when it comes to
lights that is where I lack the most info
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain Simply doesn't it doesn't care
like no offense to the light thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about the plants the nutrients the
water I could see that the numbers and
[SPEAKER_00]: those charts and things my brain goes what
I don't want to know that so I've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: light ignorance and some white ADD I guess
so I think you can teach me In a great way
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand light so I'm gonna quit
rambling and I'm gonna give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to teach me about LEDs so You
talk about the McCree curve and you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should you start bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you want to teach me first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, man I mean there's really
there's a lot of different like terms and
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers to kind of get used to But there's
really as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only like two or three things that
you have to know And I would probably I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: probably start off explaining Spectrum and
and color temperatures and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's that's what everybody wants
to hear about Everybody's hard for that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we're gonna begin
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so let's let's figure out spectrum
real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna share my screen and And get
started here cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um all white light is composed of all
the different colors of light and They all
[SPEAKER_01]: mix together to make white and then if you
run white light through a prism It breaks
[SPEAKER_01]: up into a beautiful rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the visible colors of white are
there You know from purple and violet up
[SPEAKER_01]: into blue green yellow and orange red and
they're all there in different amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know So you can look at like the light
bulbs in your house and see like oh this
[SPEAKER_01]: one's got a little bit more of like an
orange yellow And then I turn on the
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescent light in my kitchen and see
like this one has a higher proportion of
[SPEAKER_01]: blue They're all mixed in there together,
but they're all in different amounts and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's white light So that leaves us with
the question of what what amount of each
[SPEAKER_01]: color do we want to use in our indoor
gardens and That question luckily has an
[SPEAKER_01]: answer and it's had an answer for a really
long time and That answer is specific to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me get this slide show working
again There you go, there we go,
[SPEAKER_01]: so this guy Dr. McCree I assumed he was a
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he was just really smart but he went
through in the 80s and tested each
[SPEAKER_01]: different color of light on A bunch of
different plants including cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he must have been pretty fucking cool
And like you can see the rainbow in here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know right over here at the left end
you've got violet it comes in through the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue to the green into the red and You
know when McCree started testing how
[SPEAKER_01]: different colors of light he found out
that red was the jam and it works at a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent relative efficiency and
then you got blue coming in around 80% and
[SPEAKER_01]: green coming in around 60% So yeah,
this is the par curve and it's it's based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the pre curve for cannabis and this is
kind of if you ever hear the term par It
[SPEAKER_01]: stands for photosynthetically active
radiation Which is just a fancy way of
[SPEAKER_01]: saying light, you know, and okay It's not
it's not one of like the three things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you really need to memorize.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to those This is all just kind
of background information So far I see So
[SPEAKER_00]: far I see that plants don't really care
for this green and yellow stuff But
[SPEAKER_00]: they're loving the reds and they're loving
they're liking the blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, man, I mean, okay, I think that
matching this curve is Gonna give you
[SPEAKER_01]: superior plant health Okay, I'll get to
that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure I'm following
along correctly Yeah, and people have
[SPEAKER_01]: tried just growing with red Blue those are
those purple LEDs That you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're still on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Unfortunately, the single color red and
blue diodes are really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's not really advantageous to
just have red and blue like you want like
[SPEAKER_01]: a full spectrum white light that also
includes green and The first verbal lights
[SPEAKER_01]: were invented by NASA so that they could
grow lettuce on the International Space
[SPEAKER_01]: Station cool and they Just wanted the red
and blue because when you're I guess when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in fucking outer space Like every
watt count like they're they're like phd
[SPEAKER_01]: is trying to save like every time a little
scrap of electricity Because they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking space Yeah, um, so then you would
yeah, you would just use red and blue
[SPEAKER_01]: because they are the most efficient but
besides just the efficiency of driving
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis there's uh the plant
response That that is kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: separate factor You know, so you might
think you want to use all red,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you would actually end up with a
fucked up plant Okay, the plants are the
[SPEAKER_01]: boss Yeah, exactly all right, so
Superimposed on the paragraphs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got kind of the the spectrum graphs
of different colored led grow lights and
[SPEAKER_01]: also hps lights so
[SPEAKER_01]: I Really like the 3500k color temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what all my lights have always come
standard in I only recently started
[SPEAKER_01]: offering the 3000k color temperature as
like an option Okay Because I think 3500k
[SPEAKER_01]: is perfect and yeah on that graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the green one and it it just
almost perfectly matches that that ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum graph for canvas You know,
so uh, you get really healthy looking
[SPEAKER_01]: short bushing plants with fucking dense
frosty nubs Yeah, praying huge praying
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves they're pointing straight up The
plants just love it man They do I they
[SPEAKER_00]: really do and i'm not just trying to you
know Just because I use the lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see huge differences in my plants I kind
of had to relearn how to grow my nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are different My environment is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big adjustment and the plants are
happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much happier So yeah, I do see a
huge difference in the performance
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think it's just really best
to get that proper balance between red and
[SPEAKER_01]: blue and And stick with it, you know 3500k
and also 3000k is a little bit more red
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still also very close so with
3500k, you're going to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter inner nodes and potentially Some
frostier plants and flower and with 1000k
[SPEAKER_01]: your nodes might be a little bit longer
and you're potentially going to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger yields in flower You know All
right, you know i'm used to i'm i'm the
[SPEAKER_00]: old school grower i'm used to switching
from the halides to the hbs as I switch
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower Do I still want to stick with
my same led light and just keep my Uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: my cannon's up the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to start giving me veg
lights and flowering lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly, man, uh the differences between
3500 kelvin and 3000 kelvin are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be very subtle and The last thing I wanted
to say about spectrum was to stop fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: worrying about spectrum Because it's
really It's really not that important If
[SPEAKER_01]: you just one of the one of the two things
You need to remember about leds is to get
[SPEAKER_01]: 3500k or 3000k for your color temperature
I don't know what a kelvin is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it's 3000 I just know
that Like 3000 is a little more red 3500
[SPEAKER_01]: has a little bit more blue And I think
3500 has the best balance of red and blue
[SPEAKER_01]: for full cycle And it's my favorite You
know If you're really just focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: flower if you're never going to veg with
this light Sometimes people like to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the 3000 kelvin if if they're a little bit
more focused on trying to get the best
[SPEAKER_01]: yield they can Um, you do have a good
reason to believe you might get a slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: higher yield with 3000 because you've got
a little bit more red in there Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the other important thing about your
red red and blue balance is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: determines the height of the plant And
that's really the important thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum is that it's going to determine
the height of the plant like if you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at uh
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing i've noticed is my plants are
much uh bushier tighter tighter inner node
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing squattier They don't stretch
nearly as much and that transition uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the three weeks from veg to flower I'm as
used to my plants taking off I could have
[SPEAKER_00]: veged for another week because they didn't
go as hard as i'm used to with leds So
[SPEAKER_00]: that was advantageous for sure Yeah,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well what I was Hang on what I was
going to show you Was that you went Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what I wanted to show you was how you
went from uh, high pressure sodium to a
[SPEAKER_00]: 3500 k lb Oh, I was missing a lot I wasn't
getting any of that blue and I was missing
[SPEAKER_00]: the peak red part Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look at that hps spectrum And that
yellow orange color should be very
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar You know Yeah, that's what the
room looks like right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this goes to show you two things that
if you're really heavy on red without the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue to balance it out We're going to get
taller plants You know, um, so it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: illustrates it right there and then it
does also show you um Kind of how like
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum really has a limited impact on
the plant because I mean we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: growing really dank shit With high
pressure sodium for decades and if you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at it compared to the mccree curve I
mean that spectrum's kind of fucked up and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a really big difference between an
hbs and and a full spectrum led But the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants still grow great under hbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you still get frosty nugs and big
yields It's just they're a bit taller um
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really the only major difference
you're going to be seeing I think they eat
[SPEAKER_00]: better I think since we're giving them,
uh the things they want spectrum wise
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to photosynthesize and
metabolize process the food better I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to up some nutrients and I had to lower
some because they didn't need some
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients because they're getting fed
enough of the other things I had to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of adjust a little bit So I think the
plants are just they're happier with the
[SPEAKER_00]: led I just think it's closer to what they
it's by looking at the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells me for sure It's closer to what
they actually wanted right Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost dead on And um, it's so close
that you really don't need to Like i've
[SPEAKER_01]: tried all the different like spectrums
combined i've tried like supplementing
[SPEAKER_01]: reds and blues and all that different
stuff and mixing them all together in
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy ways and Honestly, i've never seen
anything work much better than 3,500 k or
[SPEAKER_01]: 3,000 k just on its own You know,
um, if you've got the extra money and the
[SPEAKER_01]: extra time you can have fun doing That you
know and mixing in a bunch of little tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: different colors and stuff and your
light's gonna look like a spaceship It's
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking cool fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But if you want to get the job done
You know, yeah until the aliens come and
[SPEAKER_00]: give us new technology This is probably
uh, i'm i'm really happy with my leds i've
[SPEAKER_00]: said it before on shows But I don't know
if i've told you this the seeds I made
[SPEAKER_00]: under led lights are the best seeds i've
ever made I've been making seeds for years
[SPEAKER_00]: countless years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember when I started
Making seeds and when I used leds my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: were bigger harder fatter healthier better
germination rate more viable seeds per
[SPEAKER_00]: batch sometimes you get those like White
seeds at the bottom of the plant or seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that just didn't quite get what they
needed I had way less of those more usable
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in this last harvest all grown under
led And that tells me that the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: just healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just something naturally is
happier about that plant Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, definitely man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, i've heard that from a couple other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's awesome Uh, I never would
have known that if it weren't for you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: because I never grow any seeds Yeah,
you're welcome Yeah, man, that's why I
[SPEAKER_01]: really i've been growing with these lights
for years, man I really think the best
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to do is uh to find that proper
balance and to stick as close as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: To what the plant really says it wants
Yeah, and then just the plants are the
[SPEAKER_00]: boss better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just an overall health thing
and if they're if they're happy growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it Oh, yeah, they will clap their
hands bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will clap their hands Yeah,
um, i've got i've got questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't want to derail you too much So
let me keep you focused on your uh on your
[SPEAKER_00]: your beautiful presentation Where are you
headed next for me buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want to throw you off Um,
I just wanted to uh, there was like one
[SPEAKER_01]: other thing I wanted to say um,
I wanted to show you guys the 5 000 kelvin
[SPEAKER_01]: color temperature And uh, you know that
one i've grown with it and it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple to blue, uh, it seems to be slowing
down growth rates at that point um and uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: also your nodes are just so stacked dude,
like they're just right on top of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other And you end up having to do like a
lot of selective, uh, you know pruning of
[SPEAKER_01]: side grants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, so There is such a thing as like
too short Oh, yeah, and too too tight too
[SPEAKER_00]: squatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does become a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right Is there a is there a 4200
kelvin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a thing I can find and buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a 4000 kelvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but Yeah, you could buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly like I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay, I think 3500 is pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's that's what you're using I
don't know like would you want your notes
[SPEAKER_01]: to be any shorter?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no No, they're they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get any tighter, it'll be
problematic on some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would definitely make a difference
Yeah, and i've talked about I may have
[SPEAKER_00]: selected different plants Uh from my fino
selections in the past I may have chosen
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff because of these lights
Like they were growing they were
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching and the plants were different
shapes because they were under hbs I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: under leds and the plants perform
completely differently and i'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh I I should have gotten rid of that and
kept that stretching You know because
[SPEAKER_00]: under this light it would have been
perfect, but it was too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tossed it Yeah, it probably would
have changed my selections for sure Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, it'll have uh, it'll have a big
effect on plant height um, and then really
[SPEAKER_01]: minor effects In other places,
you know, yeah So I I think the the frost
[SPEAKER_00]: level is there too the the resin the
trichome development It is there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it comes on early Definitely All
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, actually i've never grown with
hps So I never had anything to compare it
[SPEAKER_01]: to I grew back in back in the day You know
old school old school We'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: those awesome shit, man Yeah, it did a
good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did a good job my my best until I had
Led was when I would put a metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: hbs in the same hood and run those
together That was my most flavorful most
[SPEAKER_00]: potent most photogenic herb ever until I
switched up to the leds And now I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: can far surpass that Uh, and it's much
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to fight so much cooling So
that helps out the environment a lot until
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter came and then I needed a heater
I almost put up an hbs again just to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: my room cool or warm Because it got so
cold that I didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only complaint that I had
It's like they're not hot enough Yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so That kind of leads into one of
your questions if you wanted to yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah Yeah, I was gonna say people always
say that led is cooler and it is cooler Uh
[SPEAKER_00]: in some way i'm noticing that but i've got
more wattage in the room technically There
[SPEAKER_00]: are more watts in there than there was
when I was running an hbs The numbers are
[SPEAKER_00]: higher in wattage, but the heat is lower I
was taught that a watt is a watt because
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity is electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I getting less heat out of that
light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's more efficient So,
um A watt and this is dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that i've had like
straight up nerd fights on like all kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of social media about Because i'm not
qualified to argue with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna win Like no, it's fucking
not so a watt becomes 3.8 BT music Of heat
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But that's only if it becomes heat If
it becomes light And then hits a leaf Then
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of that energy and that watt of
electricity becoming heat It becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical energy locked up in the plant You
know chloroplast Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what that's what chlorophyll
does is it turns light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Into sugar basically or into Chemical
bonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right So that energy cannot become
chemical energy and heat energy at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time because of the law of
thermodynamics So, you know like uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've got Like a 10 a 10 watt water
pump You know some of those 10 watts will
[SPEAKER_01]: become heat but some of it will also
become mechanical energy the energy of
[SPEAKER_01]: that moving water Okay, so you you have to
and and whatever whatever percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: that energy that does what the thing is
supposed to do is the efficiency And
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever's left over is the heat Unless
you're talking about a space heater,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's just 100 heat because that's
what it's supposed to do efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay So if the energy becomes light then
it's not really becoming heat um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh, so there's that And then there's
the way the heat that an LED does create
[SPEAKER_01]: gets distributed like it all gets sucked
up into a heat sink and then kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly radiated uh from the surface of the
metal Um, so if you've got your lights
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging up by your carbon filter by your
exhaust fan, uh, then You're pumping out
[SPEAKER_01]: that heat much more efficiently than an
hbs Which has a bunch of heat blasting
[SPEAKER_01]: straight down from the bulb onto your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know instead of Slowly radiating
directly into your uh exhaust fan Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes sense Yeah, big old bright heat
source just throwing heat out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got that efficient little tiny
diode That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat source is so much smaller that it
makes sense anyway But that was a a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful explanation because honestly,
uh, I think I was believing the nerds that
[SPEAKER_00]: a watt is a watt but the way you said
that, uh, even my Non-physics
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding self got a good grasp of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't become heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became plant energy Because it was the
right uh type of light that the plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: use it and it didn't get wasted off this
heat right Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense to me for you man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you notice that all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Difference in a commercial grow like from
when the plants are small to when the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire room is just completely covered in
canopy Theoretically the room should get
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I noticed the humidity more It's
more funky and damp in there because all
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants but yeah I do notice it takes
more to change the temperature when there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot of Plants in there for sure
Yeah, i'm not exactly sure Uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I think it does it stays cooler in
there because the plants are putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: so much water that it's cool in there But
then it gets so humid I kind of want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put a big room a commercial room filled
with leds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done that yet I've just got
small spaces But that's gonna i'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to rethink everything once I do that
all of the hvac all of the airflow It'll
[SPEAKER_00]: all be a totally different redesign,
which it's gonna throw me for a loop and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those loops Yeah, man Uh,
so What can other I know what I can expect
[SPEAKER_00]: because i've done it now that I understand
the heat are other than Uh, I switched to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight leds in the middle of the winter and
that was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not have done that So that's
something I can warn people about if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're relying on the light for heat Don't
switch in the middle of winter because you
[SPEAKER_00]: will measure grow up What else can people
expect to expect when they switch from an
[SPEAKER_00]: hps or a cmh?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the leds because there is a little bit
of a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you warn us about any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything Yeah, um, so there's going to be
potentially some changes in your feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they might you know, a lot of people
say they need more calcium and veg and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more magnesium Yeah So yeah,
if you've got a really dialed in feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: regimen with a really well-known strain
The run where you switch your lights up
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't just be on autopilot like
you were on the last 20 runs Like you are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to watch that plant again
because it's going to be even differently
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, um, and the temperature is going to
be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you're gonna want to get one of
these Uh an infrared thermometer and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna be able to check the surface
temperature of your leaf Because uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're used to growing with cmh or hps,
there's a lot more infrared and a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: downward facing heat so the actual
Temperature of your leaf is usually if i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not mistaken usually higher than the
ambient temperature of the room But with
[SPEAKER_01]: leds, uh, you know, and I can pull this
screen up again real quick So over here to
[SPEAKER_01]: the right side of the of the red portion
of this graph is where you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared And you can see on the graph that
the leds drop off really sharply and they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't put out any it has a There you go,
there you go here on the right That uh
[SPEAKER_01]: right where this curve drops off is where
you go from far red into infrared,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is heat And you can see how the leds
really drop off right there and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: put out any infrared So what's going to
happen is your leaf surface temperature is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be Almost exactly the same as the
ambient temperature of your room cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people will be like oh put
infrared on your Girl lights and i'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, let's think this through real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to Spend extra money on an led
light that's going to reduce your
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures And then you want to spend
extra more money on an infrared light
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to raise your temperatures
back up again but All you have to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: turn down your ac a few degrees and raise
the temperature of your your ambient
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature of your garden and then That
will raise the leaf surface temperature up
[SPEAKER_01]: to where you want it And and you're
spending less money on ac, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole fucking point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, i'm getting more efficient light
Instead of spending more money on making
[SPEAKER_01]: your light hotter So you can run your ac
harder and get the same, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like yeah My my electric bill has
gone down quite a bit quite a bit since I
[SPEAKER_00]: switched leds I'm not running the big
hps's so they're not sucking up so much
[SPEAKER_00]: juice But then I don't have so many fans
and ac is going I don't have to fight the
[SPEAKER_00]: room so much So yeah, it definitely made a
big difference big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad I converted you man Yeah,
I was uh, I was hesitant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was skeptical for a long time But well,
I always called it a light bright because
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw those silly purple things and I was
like that's not And I saw so many weird
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed results from plants and I called it
a light bright But then when I saw what
[SPEAKER_00]: yours were doing and then uh, we worked
out a nice nice thing It was definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good job, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good sales pitch And you stayed on me for
a minute I'm looking to see if I have any
[SPEAKER_00]: more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've answered Most of my
questions the changes I noticed we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna change our Feeding and plant
structure and growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna get as much stretch as I'm
used to a little bit tighter nodes Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have needed a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have been wise to put in a heater
during the winter But other than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I nailed it Do you offer any
products with a far red light or is that
[SPEAKER_00]: something coming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Yeah, not really man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I've I've done it all like I've
tried far Reds, I guess, uh, probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow mouse puck would be your best bet if
you want to fuck around with far red but
[SPEAKER_01]: um, what we're all about at black sale
market is um Building really big high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality high intensity full spectrum leds
Because all of my experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything i've learned has shown me that
that's what gets the job done You need the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a big fuck-off powerful light Uh
and yeah as efficient as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh and as cheap as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's always been Like my ethic
and like my my what what's guided me in
[SPEAKER_01]: the design of all my lights is is that
goal and um Like I just that's how you get
[SPEAKER_01]: the job done, man I think there's a lot of
really overpriced and over engineered
[SPEAKER_01]: lights out there and all you really need
to know Is 3,500 k 3,000 k and hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper intensity You know, so like for
instance, um Like my 640 watt two-pack Uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will give you maximum growth rates and
yields in flower over a four by four In
[SPEAKER_01]: veg over a five by five and it's on sale
for six hundred and sixty five dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: with coupon code roste jet So you go where
you're at if you know your leds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's an amazing deal And that
like we're really not we're not fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: around over here You know I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't gonna bring it up because it
wasn't important but I could feel your uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Your army training come through like get
the fucking job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need extra shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need frills We don't need bells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need whistles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need fucking fancy glitter tape
Get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that approach and uh, i'm gonna
compliment you i've been to your workspace
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been to your old workspace and your
new workspace you guys his workspace Is
[SPEAKER_00]: immaculate you can sit down and eat dinner
off of his workspace floor Uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I complimented him one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said dude you cleaned the fucking corner
that I would have missed He gets in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's that corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right here that everybody like you
swept everything but right there There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little smack in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets that stuff So that tells me uh,
the way that somebody does something is
[SPEAKER_00]: the way they do everything So that tells
me those lights are put together but the
[SPEAKER_00]: corners have been cleaned and dusted So
that's that's a good compliment to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for taking such good care of
your customers Thank you, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you didn't know I was coming to
inspect so it was super clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed up randomly Oh surprise
inspection Yep, I got you No, it's uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean and that's honestly like that that
very uh rugged kind of utilitarian sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the army was going to be able to
grow light it would probably look a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: like mine like You know it gets the job
done man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fucking tank and it will get the
job done It might be olive green or
[SPEAKER_01]: something instead of black but yeah Now
you just sold them an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna come out with it I've
actually got a lot of irie genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: growing under my uh under my cannon leds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it when you show off those pictures
I mean, it's one thing to hear us talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, but it's another thing to see it
for yourself, you know and uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's so that's three of my 320 watt
canyons over a four by six And that's four
[SPEAKER_01]: orange gassums in there filling out a four
by six That's really really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have those leds at full power or
are they turned down at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're at full power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so each one's covering a two by four
basically All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what is that in flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: um Everything all my coverage areas and
recommendations on that front are designed
[SPEAKER_01]: for maximum yields in flower Um,
so in veg because your day is 30 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: longer You have to remember to turn that
light down 30 percent and they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: dimmable You know, which is another really
great thing about leds man Because if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're running the same amount of wattage
in veggie and flower you're fucking up you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, right the plants got a certain
amount of uh of light that it can process
[SPEAKER_01]: in a day and in veg that day is 33 percent
longer so the the intensity needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: turned down 33 percent You know,
if you start seeing the leaves start
[SPEAKER_00]: drooping you can't see my arms at the edge
of the screen if the leaves start drooping
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting just a little bit weak toward
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not angry They're tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either Reduce your amount of light
that is coming out of that light or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on the right schedule You can
reduce an hour of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't over light the plants you can
save electricity It doesn't matter a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're running two cannons your
electricity bill is not going to notice
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're running a hundred gavitas
that kind of stuff really adds up So learn
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you can just to make yourself a
little bit more efficient And right now
[SPEAKER_00]: during these times bro paychecks are hard
to get money is more expensive than ever
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you are running two cannons,
maybe that will save you a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's six bucks on the electric
bill might get you somewhere these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fucking gallon of gas right now
So Yeah money's expensive nowadays Things
[SPEAKER_00]: are weird Uh our our cannon lights readily
available Oh, yeah, definitely man
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you make them yourself and I know
that supply chains are weird right now I
[SPEAKER_00]: was at the grocery store trying to buy
soil and nutrients and just basic things
[SPEAKER_00]: and half the stuff I wanted was sold out
So knowing that your lights are there that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes me feel better Yeah, I have managed
to uh, I mean there's been some definite
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments i've had to make and um You
know, I had to start ordering My
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory, uh a lot farther ahead Oh,
yeah, you know, yeah, but so far man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come close, dude I've been down to
like my last two lights and like oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's excellent Yeah, what are these
boxes gonna get here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but so far I haven't run out Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a sign of good business being
worried that you're going to run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign of success coming your way
That's that's a good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think uh, we've got a lot of great info
out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to share with us before we start
wrapping up this part of the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, just real quick, dude The third thing
you need to know about leds is that uh to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the proper intensity in veg You need
about 600 watts per four by four of high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality full spectrum leds So forget about
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just showed you with graphs and numbers
all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just learn three things 3000 kelvin 3500
kelvin 600 watts per four by four and you
[SPEAKER_01]: should be able to do the math on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's 900 watts for a five by five
300 watts for a two by four somewhere in
[SPEAKER_01]: that neighborhood and you're going to be
at the proper intensity for flower And
[SPEAKER_01]: then just turn your light down 30 percent
in veg And that's everything you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: know about leds man as a grower like that
You will be set up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get the fucking job done There
you go I'm breathing under leds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving them sounds like a great
formula for success Um, I think we covered
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I'm gonna remind them one more
time to check out black sale market.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and use coupon code rasta Jeff Make sure
you go get yourself some cannon leds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a plenty of contact info on the
website?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they have questions, they can harass
you and stalk you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, you'll find my email on the
website and Hit me up on instagram or or
[SPEAKER_01]: can was that black sale market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, give him a follow you guys He posts
a lot of great stuff post a lot of irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics because he's growing my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give him a follow There and thank you
bro for the great photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great weed Oh man,
it works out very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all we've got dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you for giving me a great
presentation Thank you for teaching me
[SPEAKER_00]: about lights in a way that I could
understand I feel like if I understood it
[SPEAKER_00]: then my audience probably did too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all saying thank you You're
getting about 5 000 high fives right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, bro You guys make sure you
check out my buddy keith on embracing
