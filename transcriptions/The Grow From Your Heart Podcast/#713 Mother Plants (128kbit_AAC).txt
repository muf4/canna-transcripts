and of course the sweet new Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast hemp hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've talked about these on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly let me ramble about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This piece inside here, this is just a
protective piece so that when I ship it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you it doesn't get crushed and destroyed,
keeps the hat supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've got here is the Grow From Your
Heart podcast original logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the EQ logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that EQ bar on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a, I should mention,
these are made by Alpine Hemp Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a hemp hat made by our friends
at Alpine Hemp Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Alpine Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo
on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bill here we've got the red,
yellow, and green stitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hold that up closer to the camera
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's picking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the Alpine Hemp sticker that
does come off when you're ready or leave
[SPEAKER_00]: it on there if you're that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Alpine Hemp hang tag here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the red, yellow, and green
stitching across the top of the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got the, it says GFYHTV on the
side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this side we've got the Alpine Hemp Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: tag, which is also, ladies and gentlemen,
that is a joint caddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stick a joint in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show you with the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a joint handy, but you could
stick a pen right in there, and that would
[SPEAKER_00]: work also as a joint caddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could rock a fat spliff up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have a joint ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be careful if you only do that in
legal locations, but we got a joint caddy
[SPEAKER_00]: up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we got the cool red hemp tag back
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let everybody know you're rocking the hemp
hat that you care about the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: about the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using hemp now.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inside, you probably already saw
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't spoken about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is printed with a sublimated image of
blue raspberry truffle seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, that is an image
of blue raspberry truffle seeds made to
[SPEAKER_00]: look like you've got seeds inside the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, red, yellow, green liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to keep it Rasta for the Rasta Jeff
style here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hats, my friends, my fellow smokers
and growers, these are available on the
[SPEAKER_00]: web store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply hit the website iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the merch store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will take you right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were supporting on Patreon,
you've already got the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where it will show you,
but you may get an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for the continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went longer than it was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I will blow out some of the other
merch when you go to for the coupon code
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be valid on all of the
merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shirts, stickers, grinders, rolling trays,
dab mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff will be getting blown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to add more merch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to blow out some of this merch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of boxes with random
shit in it, and there's not enough stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in those boxes to make those boxes sitting
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to liquidate and consolidate some
merchandise so that we can get new
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to order some new merch for the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any merch ideas for spring,
Grow From Your Heart podcast, iregenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise, I would love to see your
designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a certain merch piece that I
haven't offered, I like to offer things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are useful and practical to the
community as merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grinders, rolling trays, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're using those exactly as
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hats are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shirts are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're part of the merch marketing
team, let me know what else I should make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got some designs,
if there's a strain that I put out that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have cool artwork and you make
some artwork, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can use your artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, we have to be careful
with some of the strains that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: created.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't make art for all of them because
that may get us in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the strain name is derived from
something famous already, we probably
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't make artwork for it,
but some things we could definitely use
[SPEAKER_00]: artwork for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I feel like I'm begging for art,
begging for your help out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys told me to design you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends on Discord helped me design
this hat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the crowd help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to be wearing it,
rocking it, using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not get your feedback?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've talked about all this stuff
on the notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the topic of this podcast,
which is your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mom plants to be more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an email here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend
UsedToBeCool.
[SPEAKER_00]: UsedToBeCool has been listening to the
podcast for a long time, has not emailed
[SPEAKER_00]: with a question in quite a while,
which makes me feel like our friend is
[SPEAKER_00]: learning quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten confident in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't needed my help, which makes
me proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the mechanic shop the other day and
I said, it was good seeing you,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, but I really hope I don't have to see
you for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he understood exactly what I meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I see him, something's wrong
with the damn car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't want to have to see him for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that our buddy UsedToBeCool is
doing great because he hasn't messaged me
[SPEAKER_00]: with a problem in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I will quit rambling and we'll
cut to the chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you read this on your show,
please don't use my real name,
[SPEAKER_00]: brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a lot of your messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you as UsedToBeCool.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see your real name, it just
translates into my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it by now, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big love, big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being around for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a question about keeping a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never kept a cut beyond a few runs,
mainly because of space restraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is completely understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got recreational cannabis,
you are allowed six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your medical recommendation,
you are allowed an additional six in most
[SPEAKER_00]: cities and counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most places limit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk about their extended
plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of cities and counties don't give a
shit about your extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are limited to six and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, however, I found a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to explore a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude fell in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it was the only female from a
pack of freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's cool that the female freebie
was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female freebie was fucking fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fabulous you found her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that five times fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she can't be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I know that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of female cuts that cannot
be replaced, especially my male cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if we had to find another King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have smoked some good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, however, I realize I don't really
know how to keep a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: My specific question is whether I should
multi top the plant to increase branches
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can harvest more cuts or simply let
it grow naturally and let the cuts I take
[SPEAKER_00]: also count as topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also just like some basic
information about how long to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother before flowering it out and
starting a new mom and any other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like my printer just fucking gave
up at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, nope, I'm done printing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends with and any other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you can ask for any other
information that I can provide to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep a mother plant happy set you up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that because I do have a
lot of useful tips being a breeder a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have kept cuts around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for having to hear that for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kept cuts around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about a flow plant that I had
for 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably had that fucker for 1012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I probably had that plan for 12
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to say 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 10 or 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a flow plant by keeping a mother
plant of it when that mother plant would
[SPEAKER_00]: outgrow the pot or outgrow the shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they just that you cut them and
take mom and take clones off them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start getting unshapely and unruly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just take another fresh cut and
rejuvenate and start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thing as a breeder with the
selection of mom plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I do routinely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about every six months, sometimes
sooner, depending on the cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Congo grows too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has to be remombed too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to remom my shit occasionally
just to keep the genetics fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to keep them unruly, the shape that I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you started with a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up into something that we
should that you should have done further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't know this was going to be a
champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did not know to keep a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is why I say always keep a clone
of every plant you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a lot of test seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to keep a clone of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do in that a lot of times I'm
willing to just let it go because I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: enough seeds where I can run it and find
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found I've seen what I wanted to see
that can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too attached a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do wish I had a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would have kept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, what I will do is revege a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never too late to cut a clone off of
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have decided that that plant is
fucking fire, you want it, cut a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that around or revege that plant
after you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done full episodes on cutting clones,
reveging, monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done episodes on all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always take a clone because you never
know if it's going to be fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never ever know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like this case, it's the only female
and it needs to be kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would have had a clone,
if you have a clone, then you can keep
[SPEAKER_00]: this going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you've got a clone,
but always keep a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where are we or learn to revege?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have reveged a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have talked about this on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a friend's greenhouse and he had
plants that were pretty far along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost smokeable, but not quite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought it would be nice and clip
me off a little bud, like a good size bud
[SPEAKER_00]: and toss it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, go home and smoke that and
let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, it's way too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to think it's crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was super nice of you because our
buddy, white Mike had the brilliant idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, if you don't clone that you
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, I think we're
thinking the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we drove straight to the house,
put it in some clone X, put it in a dome,
[SPEAKER_00]: got it, put it in a clone plug,
put it in a dome, got it going as a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that fucker rooted and it revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a clone of my friend's plant
that he didn't know that I had kept it
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: May, maybe, maybe I've bred something to
it recently that we can't talk about yet
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the show, because people don't
even know that that's what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself on track here so you
can clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never too late to clone something,
revege it and rescue it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk more about keeping a mom
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first question is how do you shape it
to provide clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many clones you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how your growth style is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing I always take that
middle top right out and make that a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: because all the other branches are going
to grow to a certain height and that top
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to keep going and fuck everything
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to you're going to have to
adjust the light and everything because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that top bud, that top node, that apical
dominant node.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that as a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a nice even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a lot of options for
cloning once it starts to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a home grower, you're probably I'm
assuming here you're probably not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need more than six, twelve, maybe twenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your state, your limit,
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to need a lot of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one mother plant in a three to five
gallon pot can provide a lot of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have to learn how to shape it to
provide those clones and where to cut from
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the plant active and growing to
give you even more clones once you've cut
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of learning, learning the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that is squat and
stout and it makes a lot of branching,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easier to get more clones more
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a tall stretchy plant like
the Congo, there aren't a lot of places to
[SPEAKER_00]: clone from, but there's a lot of plant
material because it's so fucking long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one big main with like eight side
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to clone from it,
I could get nine clones maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got some let's talk about the
Chernobyl plant that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fucker grows real short, real squat
and makes one main top that takes off
[SPEAKER_00]: within a lot of side branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get 40 clones off of a plant the
same size as I could the Congo just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the shape and structure of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to have a lot to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main things are the shape and
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how many clones and how
frequently do you need them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always start with that main top,
take that out, let them grow evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they get taller, take those as
your next round of clones and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you'll have like a hedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can, you'll learn when I cut
here, always cut at the node when there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another node sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your main branch and you got
another, let me come down, let me adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: this mic and get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the main branch coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your main branch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are leaves, whatever my fingers are
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a node right here sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got another branch coming off,
top it right before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that new one will make another branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, or there's one coming up here
and one coming up here, you just made two
[SPEAKER_00]: tops where there was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the next time you cut,
you got this sticking out and now you got
[SPEAKER_00]: two tops and you can, those will make more
tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do the same thing and you can cut
the tops out of there and then you'll make
[SPEAKER_00]: four out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, once you figure out that art,
you'll get really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that you can reclone this
plant, get a clone of it, grow it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it as a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once it gets unruly, unshapely,
use one of your clones as your new mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and keep practicing to achieve the
shape you need, your desire, the shape
[SPEAKER_00]: that reaches your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a bunch of notes here that I
didn't even talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom question, selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: What works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you found one you want to play
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a plant that you want to turn
into a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend keeping it under a veg
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have this note written down,
so I want to talk about this quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't up pot your mother plants,
sometimes some plants do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to begin to auto flower or show
you problems once they get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it in a big enough pot for it to
grow wide and strong, have a healthy root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone that we can branch out, bush out and
provide you the clones you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pot size is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, I'm going to say that veg
light is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same with the pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't give it enough light,
if you don't give it enough air,
[SPEAKER_00]: enough space, if the VPD is off,
if this plant gets stressed out and you
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it around for a while, it may try to
flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give it enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on we're going to talk about
daily light integral in a very soon
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming episode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on the kind of light you're
giving it, the intensity and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, pay attention to that light,
pay attention to the plant, give it enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light to where it will not go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes I run 18 six for my mom's
often if I've got full control of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, it'll be 20 on and four off
for my mother plants, give them those two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours extra of light just makes them grow
stronger, prevents them from flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even get the idea that it's
dark enough to think about flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get four hours for the plant
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the root cycles, a lot of the
stuff happening down there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere happens in the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the growth stuff happens in the
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want my equipment to get a four
hour rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's four hours of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to pay for four hours longer,
my bulb will last every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like a big deal in a
homegrown a small cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're running a large scale
commercial cultivation facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: your mom room can be I've been in a
bedroom, a mom room with 50 to 100 lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: just vegging and mom I've been in much
larger, but I'm just saying it can be 50
[SPEAKER_00]: lights just for mother plants just for
keeping genetics and small clones around
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can minimize the amount of
lights that are on the time, give your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment some rest that will save some on
the bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also time on your equipment, less fans
running less shit happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything costs a little something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now everything costs a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lights, think about lighting,
we want veg lighting, blue lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the options for switching up
your old school, you do HPS and metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halides, you want the blue metal halides
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your LED light has a switch for veg or
flower, switch that fucker to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you want to be the most blue
light you can give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert on lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do want veg lights at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to go with that veg light,
we do want vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus mainly on that nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to need a little bit of Cal
Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in high performance mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get bigger and the soil burns
out, whatever you got them in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will need to feed them Cal Mag and
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about the basics, just basic veg
newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to feed them a lot of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed everything a shit ton of microbes
just because I think that keeps the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk in the future about
overfeeding of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But feed a veg nutrients basically,
your basic vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to give it all the boosters
and shit because you're not trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it grow, grow, grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to make it a big enough
plant to provide healthy, happy cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to touch on something I
already talked about shape it to offer the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of clones you need at the frequency
of which you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some people keep a one gallon tiny
bonsai mother plant that they take one
[SPEAKER_00]: clone off of and it grows a little bit
bigger and they take two off of and they
[SPEAKER_00]: let it grow a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time they get three, then they up-pot
that into a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe they just abandon that one and
use one of the other clones and keep going
[SPEAKER_00]: because they cannot have large plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you grow gigantic fucking plants
that you've just got hedged up and trimmed
[SPEAKER_00]: up as much as you can and you're just
taking thousands of cuts at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about shaping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping the plant will become an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you realize when I cut here,
this branch will grow this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cut here, these two split this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of have to do it to learn it and
you'll experience it and you'll figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out very quickly on a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shape it the way you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother plants can be small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how many you want to keep
around and how many cuts you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally keep my mother plants in a
three to five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them fairly far apart so the wind
can blow and they don't get any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I apply a sprayed pesticide or
foliar feed, that was harder to say than
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked, they're far enough apart that I
can get all of the plants carefully and
[SPEAKER_00]: individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them in the three to five gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I veg them out or I keep them,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep them around 18 inches,
24 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll hit about three feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get about that three feet tall,
they start getting unruly, out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to make too many adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I'll take as many clones as I
can get from one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get as many clones as I can get from
that one plant so I'll make sure that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a row of all of my mom plants in
a clone dome temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get roots as soon as I see roots and
as soon as I know I've got security,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will toss that big mother plant or maybe
I'll put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll drag it out to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pointed right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way the fuck out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll take it out to the greenhouse
out in the middle of nowhere, put it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, make some seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes, once they get big and
unruly, I whack them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts Mike's feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike has been here and helped me put giant
plants and trash cans and he just shakes
[SPEAKER_00]: his head and he's like, buddy,
I wish we could put these outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, bro, it's fucking December.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we could but they're just gonna
freeze and it's gonna be like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: heartbreaking a little bit to chop down
giant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you realize those plants have
given me 100 clones and they've served
[SPEAKER_00]: their purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made 1000 seeds and 500 other
plants and 40 pounds of weed and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about all the other shit they
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay that that big mother plant goes
bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people are going to keep big
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to keep small mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I keep medium sized mother plants
two to three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about probably I'm a drummer
that's probably 18 inches around I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about the size of a good floor
Tom 16 18 inches 18 inches round at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top I can get plenty of cuts from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sometimes let's talk about this is
this on my notes in this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, I will just drag that mother
plant in quotation marks into the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room and bloom it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were using this mother plant as a
clone donor while it vegged and you used
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones to shape that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about when I'm running a new
plant I take that main top out and use
[SPEAKER_00]: that as a clone when I'm lolly popping I
take two of the bottoms off and I use
[SPEAKER_00]: those as clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got three clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that with a mother plant and
then flower it just as easily as I did
[SPEAKER_00]: with my new seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes if you don't have space for a
full on dedicated mother plant or an
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenal of mother plants let's say that
you're limited to only 12 plants and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to keep a genetic around but you
can't dedicate a mother space or a mother
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your veg plants as a mother plant just
perpetually have let's just say we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow let's say lemon Jeffrey you've got a
lemon Jeffrey plant you want to grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again but you can't keep a
dedicated mom you've got a plant of it
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it up like you're going to veg it
take the top out take a clone of that take
[SPEAKER_00]: the two bottoms off of it because you're
going to clean the bottom of this plant up
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway take two bottoms off of it create
clones out of that now you've got three
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them should root if you've watched
my clone tech video.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a full podcast about cutting
clones I cut clones in the video if you
[SPEAKER_00]: watch that follow that SOP you will have
success one of those three clones will
[SPEAKER_00]: root if you do this so get the three
clones now once you've got your three
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and you're sure that they're going
to root you can drag that big plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower room and just take good care of
those clones maybe wait a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer if you're not super experienced but
you've got secure cuts you can keep
[SPEAKER_00]: vegging also if your veg time isn't up if
you're still vegging waiting longer you
[SPEAKER_00]: can cut those clones get them root put
them into a small pot let them grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got three of them over there now
you've got mother plants for backup pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the best one keep that as your growing
plant or keep those three for veg for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next run you've got plants for the next
run and then guess what when it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: run the next run you've got those three
plants take the three tops as clones you
[SPEAKER_00]: could probably pull fucking nine or twelve
off the bottom of those now you got at
[SPEAKER_00]: least three to twelve clones to fuck with
again drag those big plants into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room you got your clones pot those
pot them again veg them get them stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat the process so you don't
necessarily need a dedicated mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you remember to take a clone or
as many clones as you need from your crop
[SPEAKER_00]: before you flower it out most of us are
topping our plants cutting the bottoms off
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway so why not if you're doing three
big plants in the flower room four big
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the flower room you've got four
tops fucking what is that eight bottoms
[SPEAKER_00]: you could take off there that's gonna give
you however many what that is eight was 16
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 some number and multiples of four as a
drummer I should have followed along it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 12 is probably the number I'm
fucking up and I'm a drummers why I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: think of 12 um you can get your cuts off
of those plants the amount of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you're about to flower is the amount of
cuts you need probably right if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping a cycle going so you got three big
plants take three big clones and do it all
[SPEAKER_00]: over again you don't need a dedicated
mother I hope I made that clear because I
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about it for a really long time veg
the plant cut a clone veg that plant while
[SPEAKER_00]: that one's vegging throw the other one
into flower as soon as that one's ready
[SPEAKER_00]: cut more clones from it throw it into
flower you got clones they're right there
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as your clone tech is solid or as
long as you wait until you can get that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone into a pot and get it grown big
enough to where you're secure that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got it if you've got two or three copies
you know you've got it there then throw it
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower and if all else fails we can
revege the one that's in the flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: we could take a cut from that one so that
is an easy way to keep the mother plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to keep it dedicated mother
plant gotta went on for way too long about
[SPEAKER_00]: that rotate your moms occasionally if
you're not going to do the rotational move
[SPEAKER_00]: like I just talked about refresh renew and
rotate your mother plants occasionally I
[SPEAKER_00]: said I do it about every six months once a
year depending on the genetics the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation the size of the room sometimes
that goes more quickly sometimes it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: longer and a commercial grow I may do it
sooner because the plants grow so largely
[SPEAKER_00]: under all of those lights now here's
something people are going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the word you're going to try to spit out
throw at me use for controversy type in
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments is the word genetic drift
genetic drift is not possible in this
[SPEAKER_00]: situation if you listen to the full
episode I did call genetic drift that will
[SPEAKER_00]: explain why this is not genetic drift if
you do notice that your plants are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: weaker over time genetic drift is not the
cause of this if you keep a healthy mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and you take healthy clones in a
clean environment and you grow those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones properly and love them and take
care of them and feed them and don't let
[SPEAKER_00]: them get any pathogens or problems you can
perpetually keep those plants for ever you
[SPEAKER_00]: will not face any problems if you keep
them clean don't let them get any viruses
[SPEAKER_00]: any pathogens no bugs everything like that
will degrade the quality of your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that will give you weaker plants less
strength less vigor you'll start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: changes also different environments will
give you different changes so if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant is changing your clone tech
or the environment possibly are changing
[SPEAKER_00]: from that plant maybe your humidity your
warmth anything could change will give the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant a little bit different expression I
noticed that my winter crops and my summer
[SPEAKER_00]: crops are different in the same room with
the same cuts just basically because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental factors I cannot control
can't dial in because of the extremes we
[SPEAKER_00]: face here in Colorado we get negative 17
in the winter and fucking 117 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer so I've got a lot to work with I
see a lot of different conditions it's my
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility to dial them in I get as
close as I can trust me but it's a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with sometimes however genetic drift
is not the word you may see problems some
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation but in my opinion in my
experience healthy plants make healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: clones for generations I told you I kept
that flow clone around for at least 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years when I decided to get rid of it it
was just as beautiful and healthy as the
[SPEAKER_00]: day I got it I cut a bunch of clones of it
when I was done with it and I spread those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones out to my friends I felt that was
the polite thing to do I was like hey you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys love flow I've been growing her for
years I'm done with her instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: taking her out back and shooting her maybe
I'll give you guys a bunch of cuts and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can let it live on just don't let me
fucking smell it smoke it I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be around it anymore nothing wrong with
that plant you guys I'm just done with it
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smelled so much flow I grew so much
flow smoke so much flow that I'm done I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to smell it taste it look at it
I woke up every morning smelling flow then
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go to the dispensary at which I
worked and we sold flow and guess what
[SPEAKER_00]: just smell sell smoke more flow I got sick
of it shout out to flow from progressive
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing but love also big shot at the DJ
short and everybody involved in that flow
[SPEAKER_00]: store you guys know where the flow came
from if you know you know big up and thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you much respect all right healthy plants
make healthy clones I don't think genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: drift is a thing it's definitely not a
thing when we're cloning plants do some
[SPEAKER_00]: research I've already explained why in a
full episode all right my friend used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cool I think I've rambled on for long
enough about mother plants feed them veg
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients give them lots of veg light keep
them in a big enough pot to where they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get root bound because they will get
root bound and they may give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: problems there shape them the way you need
them to give you the amount of clones as
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently as you need rotate them out you
don't need a keeper mom all the time as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you've got a veg plant of that mom
you have got the genetics stored cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of it get that clone rooted put that
big plant into flower perpetually keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that bad bitch around that's how you can
do it all right ladies and gentlemen boys
[SPEAKER_00]: girls pimps hoes friends foes smokers
growers clone cutters Paul and Chuckers
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
