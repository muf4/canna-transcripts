[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rasta Jeff and it's time for
episode number 35 of the iGrowCulture
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I talked about a
proposed regulation coming down in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about going to a city council
meeting to prevent these regulations and
[SPEAKER_00]: city council has changed the date of their
next meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city's agenda did say the meeting was
on Monday, but recently they've changed
[SPEAKER_00]: the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: The date is now on Tuesday, October 14th
at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come down to one city hall place in
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday, October 14th at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public comment will be allowed during the
public forum for those who sign up before
[SPEAKER_00]: the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you plan to speak, show up around
630 and sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please come and help fight these
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're trying to do is not allow us
to grow in our homes or in our backyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to require us to make an
outbuilding to grow in, which I don't find
[SPEAKER_00]: fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please join us at a city council
meeting Tuesday at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to speak, please show up
around 630.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be quite a few of us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get on with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse came over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm waiting for Jesse while I
record this, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse will be here any minute now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are finally going to do the episode
about drying and curing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang on just a second while I do some
ads and hopefully Jesse will show up by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time I get done with this.

[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I shop at Hygrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't advertise something that I

[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of not advertising something I
don't trust in, I'm talking about this
[SPEAKER_00]: highly educated nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deserve a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me and hopefully by the
time I get done with that, our good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse will be here to talk about drying
and curing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right guys, I'm back after a couple of
tremendous dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Joey
Coco Diaz and also my good friend Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I went up to Denver to the
Denver Improv on Thursday night and we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey Coco Diaz do an amazing set of
comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey's one of my favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: He freaking crushed the Denver Improv and
it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the show, he took a few minutes to
hang out with Clint and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he hung out with everybody but then
Clint said something to him that got his
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hung out with Clint and I for quite
a while and bullshitted one on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he was walking away, he patted me on
the shoulder and he said, Ross the Jeff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I love you, right cocksucker?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for Joey Diaz to call you a cocksucker
is actually an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great and I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great and amazing show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me for an hour
after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Clint, thanks for going with me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go to more comedy shows
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure you check out the Wild
Cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Clint's comedy group that he is a
part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a listener, a regular
listener, you'll remember that around
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 30 I said that I would start
paying a dollar every time I say the F
[SPEAKER_00]: word because I'm trying to not say the F
word on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need somebody to go back and listen from
episode 30 to 34 and let me know how many
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars I owe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sick child in need and I had a
conversation with one of his parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was his uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said that I would help them out when
the time came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is my obligation to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's only a dollar, but what I'm
going to do now, starting on episode 35,
[SPEAKER_00]: every time I say the F word, it costs me
$5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will donate $5 to this sick kid,
the sick child, and try to help out their
[SPEAKER_00]: life a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'll need though, I need somebody to
tweet me or email me or let me know when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way you can do that, you can tweet
me at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me iGrowCulture at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Facebook me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just let me know how many times I'm
saying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from 30 to 34, it's $1.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 35 on, it's going to be $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does not count to the guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guests can come and they can say
whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody start tallying it up for me
and send me a bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to contact these people once
I've got a total.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will let them know that I want
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they accept the donation,
I'll send it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if they are willing, or if they
want me to reveal their identity,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you guys can see who I'm
helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got one more ad to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is brought to you by our
friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treethugger.com, live music lifestyle
magazine for concert, festival,
[SPEAKER_00]: news, and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a personal shout out to
Ryan from Treethugger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I see what you're doing with
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm proud of you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am still looking for that
theme song.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has made a theme song for me,
please shoot it to me and send it to me at
[SPEAKER_00]: iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to send an instrumental,
I can do all the voiceovers and say the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of the show and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it, and I'd definitely
make it worth your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'm going to take a couple more
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, we'll do a lesson on
drying and curing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a text message, and it's Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says he will be here in five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what's up, ladies and
gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who finally decided to show up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our good buddy, Jesse Grose, is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing tonight, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fashionably late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fashionably late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a lot of fashion in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just chilling out, putting together
a really nice episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people have been asking for the dry
and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they will be proud of what we
bring them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse actually said that he could use a
little, what is it, a primer lesson?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it's called?
[SPEAKER_00]: On how to cure some herbs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been real happy with any of my
cure jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been told they're great,
but I feel that I have a lot of room for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your standards on your own product are
always higher than everybody else's,
[SPEAKER_00]: your own expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never satisfied with my herb or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's like, that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when I play music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, that could have been better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, no, dude, you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can feel the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snowboarding as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me on a snowboard, it's like trying to put
a telephone pole on a snowboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a lot of me rolling down a
hill on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I thought you snowboarded
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, but I spend more time on the lift
and on my ass than I do on the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The left knee disagrees with the snowboard
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like my left knee wants to fly
out of the socket the entire time I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: strapped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't ski for a similar reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me to move to skis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it wouldn't hurt as bad if I
skied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll try that this winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Case to case.
[SPEAKER_00]: My snowboard friends have moved away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're here to talk about curing herb,
not talking about curing ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I guess curing herb will cure
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking into a circle because I'm
really dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We burned out the e-nail, I think,
and had to switch over to the regular rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The e-nail couldn't keep up with the
puddles we were putting on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it took a shit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, giddy up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember what you're telling me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to giddy up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into giddy on Chatroulette.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said something about sending me a
g-nail, homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't forget it, because my nail just
took a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'd be great timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to cure some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why everybody's listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing good, Rob, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of skipped right over
introducing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're having a good day?
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like you're working hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll record.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to cure some weed,
you're going to need a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a dehumidifier,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have an air conditioner,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You for sure need fans, at least one fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need what I call a hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thermometer with a humidity
reading on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to need some kind of
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer glass mason jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going a little bigger,
there's a company, I think it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick Vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little suction vac lid jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them at most of the head shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pretty chill to cure your weed
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't like them because
those are plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they leave any taste or
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going bigger, I like to buy
those Rubbermaid 32 quart containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a two-handed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could fit a lot of herb in one of
those to cure your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To cure it, those work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need something to cure it
in and a room to get it started to cure it
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal actually taught me that
curing begins at the start of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much I subscribe to Ed's
teaching, but in a sense, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you cut down that plant,
you're starting the curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that herb to dry uniformly,
not too fast, not too slow, and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want it in a hot room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it in a cool room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our lessons before, we talked about
harvest and drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended drying where the sticks on your
buds snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much where we decided we
were entering cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done everything right,
you've got all your leaves off,
[SPEAKER_00]: your buds have dried evenly in a nice room
that was temperature controlled,
[SPEAKER_00]: not too fast, not too cool, and now the
sticks are snapping and the buds are a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit damp, a little bit juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you squeeze them, they kind of stick to
your fingers, but they kind of spring back
[SPEAKER_00]: to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't crush them when you squeeze
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them to have a little spring left
into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be deceived by the crunchy layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it goes strain to strain,
but sometimes there's a lot more leaf on
[SPEAKER_01]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get tricked either way by
letting it over dry and also by thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed dries from the outside or from
the outside in, so even though the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are crispy and dry, the inside
could be really juicy still, so you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little buds are going to dry quicker than
the big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to cut, when I grow a big bud,
I actually cut that all down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: little golf ball size nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're one of my patients, you usually
get a bag full of golf balls is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do when I'm doing like the final trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when they're hanging,
the bigger buds are a little harder to
[SPEAKER_01]: break down sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put them on a rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to let them hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right before we're going to cure,
this is when the sticks will pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's all trimmed up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any leaves left.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're manicured the way you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grab one of the buds,
you pick it up and you bend the stick,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to bend like a straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to actually break,
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to leave it until it
explodes and breaks because then you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too dry or too wet of cannabis will not
cure properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're too dry, you've already missed
your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get stale buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to put it in the jar and
waste time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're too wet and you try to cure it,
you're actually going to promote mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it about right where those sticks
snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're going to start the
curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read you what I wrote of what
curing actually is and what the purpose of
[SPEAKER_00]: curing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just what I wrote down to give an
actual reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curing is used to remove excess moisture
to convert complex carbs back into sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: while removing chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is green pigment and
chlorophyll makes your buds taste harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: and smell bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes your buds burn partly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys ever smoked herb that kind of
maybe tastes like you just stuck your
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue in a light socket and you just want
to scrape your tongue off or you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: drink real bad, that stuff was not dried
and cured properly, probably not flushed
[SPEAKER_00]: properly either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as THC dries, the THC dries in your
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it dries more slowly, the more slower
it loses its water moisture, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive it will become.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the water comes out of that THC,
that's when it's ripe and nice and prime
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: By curing it, you slowly let that happen
and you don't destroy the THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't destroy your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, curing allows aerobic
bacteria to consume the chlorophyll in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is what we want to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerobic bacteria sounds like a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a good thing in this
instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerobic bacteria is made from air,
light, and moisture being sealed inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, I actually take my buds that
snap, I fill my mason jar about 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to squish them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to lightly set them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I seal that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that jar is sealed,
the aerobic bacteria begins to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that aerobic bacteria will start
eating away the chlorophyll in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you open that jar, that's when the
reaction will restart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you want to do, what I do,
is I put the buds in the jar, I seal it
[SPEAKER_00]: up, and then I wait about two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go open the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that first time I'll pour the buds out
onto my little tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to feel the buds and make sure
they're not, they haven't gotten really
[SPEAKER_00]: moist or they haven't, if you can see
sweat inside the jar, get them out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them out of there right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take them out of the jar and I start
squeezing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to feel a little bit of
moisture at the edge because it's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the middle on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want them to be damp and
sticky or I'm afraid they're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first time I dump them out and check
them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave them sitting out for a couple of
minutes if I feel like they need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll put them back in the jar and
seal that jar up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're properly dry like I'm hoping
they are at this point, I'll leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: closed for four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, and I know this sounds tedious,
but this is where, this is what separates
[SPEAKER_00]: the pros from the regular growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you get that super high
grade cured cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff you're getting at the
dispensary that tastes kind of hay-like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't mean to call out the shops,
but they don't have time or space or
[SPEAKER_00]: manpower or the patience to cure herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your caregiver or your private grower or
you are the only way you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: good cured herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary is not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes, you can taste the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste whatever other plant it was
growing next to or hanging next to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste that in these dispensary
buds, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few shops that are actually
curing their herb, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work there, so I can't tell you
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going to say there's
very few shops flushing their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to let me know when
we ... That's where we'll go there and get
[SPEAKER_00]: some herb one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I was, so you got to put your
buds back in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seal the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wait four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I open it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to check the buds and make
sure that they're not getting ... Too much
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture is not coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I feel like it's really humid inside of
the jar, I say humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not too humid inside of the jar,
I'll put them back in there, seal it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and let them sit for six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much increase the time just by a
couple of hours until I get to about 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you're checking them twice a
day, so I'll do six hours and then I'll do
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 hours and then I'll wait until about 12
hours and then I'll usually open them
[SPEAKER_00]: every morning when I wake up and then
right before I go to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 12 hours usually in my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pop open the jar, make sure it's
not too moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it sit open for just 10 or 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to exchange the air and then
seal it back up and let it sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got it to a point where you
know it's not going to get any mold in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when I like to just seal it up and
leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't open it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should burn really nicely at this
point, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: It should burn nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have ever had
perfectly cured herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that herb you can smell down the
block?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going, oh man, that stuff was
slowly dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It let all of the chlorophyll sneak out
and it let all of the flavor that should
[SPEAKER_00]: have been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the chlorophyll disappears,
that's when the other colors, the reds and
[SPEAKER_00]: the purples start popping up and you can
start seeing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives you really pretty buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the THC is allowed to dry
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it becomes more psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not completely sure about the
terpenoids, but it sounds like we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: give these terpenoids a little bit of time
to cure in there also so they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting destroyed or taken out along with
the chlorophyll or with the moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we let it go slowly, I think we're
making it smell better because we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something to the terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I know about them, they seem
very fragile too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is moderate temperatures and darkness
I think are all very key to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I read that terpenoids evaporate
at approximately 85 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We read on another episode about 106
degrees was I think where we said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's right around 100 degrees and
some of your guys' drying and curing rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting that hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I need a sip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those dabs got me all dried out and
thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, we took some monster dabs before the
show and that was pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to keep opening those jars until
you're confident that it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: mold up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a little bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Cushman prefers a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes to open his jar and take out a
couple of nugs and set them on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would have sat here and talked for 20
minutes before he would have been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: roll them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would have had to give you a lecture
about veganics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, the bud would be almost
dry enough to roll up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just picking on you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle likes his buds a little more moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Adam will take a nicely dried
and cured bud that I've given him and
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll set that shit out all day until it's
crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he grinds it up in the grinder to
where it's dust and takes heroic sized
[SPEAKER_00]: bong hits out of it because that's what he
likes to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is I like to get it to
where it's not fluffy, but it's got some
[SPEAKER_00]: squishy to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a nice hard dense snug,
you want to be able to give it a squeeze
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just pops back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that dry dusty buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you try to store your
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it gets stored for up to nine
months, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my patients, I can give them their
whole year supply at once and they're fine
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my other patients ask me to hold
onto it for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them want indoor bud throughout
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last couple of years, my stuff that's
gotten nine, 10 months, I really wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with it by the time it was that age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work on curing a little better and I
bet that those buds will store longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I messed up in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do pretty much what you do for the two
hour, pull it out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the four hour, but then it normally,
it'll go 24 hours, 18 hours before I mess
[SPEAKER_01]: with it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to set some alarms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my iPhone full of alarms,
just ridiculous beeps.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think I'm doing something crazy
because every two hours I got to run away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back dude and got to go somewhere
and go pop open a bunch of jars and then
[SPEAKER_00]: go back and get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using larger batches,
I guess I should have covered this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is get one of those big
purple Tupperware containers, Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that up with your, you can leave it
on the sticks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer it off the stick for this curing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill those containers and then I actually
flip them upside down and take the
[SPEAKER_00]: container off the lid instead of taking
the lid off the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you leave a more exposed area and then
just pop that container back onto the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to squish any buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop it open, lift the container off the
lid sitting there like a tray full of
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets a lot of airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like to use those actually the
same ones or same your size, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like the size of a brownie pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those work for short-term storage
pretty good.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning I talked about we should
have a dehumidifier, an AC unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: fans, a hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to back up and talk a little bit
about how Ed Rosenthal says curing starts
[SPEAKER_00]: at harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you pack your jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to overpack it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am learning, but I think there's a lot
of validity to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you overpack it, you create
possible different little microclimates in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost prevent the aerobic acid from
being able to form in there when you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What creates aerobic acid, I think I said
before, was oxygen and light and moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need plenty of that air in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't worry about giving it light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, a little bit of light will start
it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get it started, it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fixing the echoes in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a really small space that's real
echoey today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fan that we're fighting with,
but I'm going to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got it just there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, Ed Rosenthal says that
curing starts from pretty much when you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your buds have gotten too dry,
they're not going to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your buds are too moist, you still have
a chance, but hopefully they didn't dry
[SPEAKER_00]: too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to cut down the plant and get all
those leaves off and let it dry nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're talking about a room with
a dehumidifier, with an air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: and some fans and a hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep your plants between 60
and 75 degrees at about 50% humidity until
[SPEAKER_00]: you put them in this jar, until they reach
that stick snap in period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how you keep them from not
drying too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a guy that a long time ago,
I used to have to buy some herb and this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy usually had the greatest bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was bugging him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude, you got any more of that
LA confidential?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any more of that LA
confidential?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept telling me, I harvested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was getting eager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I asked him and he's like,
sure, man, I'll bring it to you tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought it to me and it was,
it was a really weird texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like a pine cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard, but it was also squeezy,
but the outside was really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he broke it open and the middle
was soft and it was kind of fluffy on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I immediately called him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what the hell happened,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that he dried it by opening
the oven and setting it next to the oven
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it would dry it out all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a prime example of what not to
do to dry your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could taste it and smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the weed smell like spaghetti
sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it smelled like marinara for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first thing that came to
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to kill all the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of tomato-y paste or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to get that herb dried properly
and slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to dry it up too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got anything to add to curing,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we went over that really super
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just really stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to project a lot of my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need crayons?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dehumidifier, the AC unit,
the fans, the hygrometer, you need that
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of where you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep, you need a proper room
for drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of guys are just throwing it in
their closet or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good area for drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the air moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for a dehumidifier,
what we're trying to do is we are pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: water out of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water ends up in the atmosphere
around your plants and then it has nowhere
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to suck that water out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dehumidifier is a perfect place for
that water to go and you can reuse that
[SPEAKER_00]: water to water your plants later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that's some good water.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do know if say you're drying
not a lot of plants in a large room in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Southwest, you might actually want a
humidifier to help slow things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to help out people regionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about Colorado, but as long
as you need to keep it about 60 to 75
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees that cool, actually I think will
make your buds dry a little more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it hardens them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I got to mention dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that dry room dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying and curing should happen in mostly
a dark area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like literally a room exact two
same climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that's dark and one that's light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room with lights, the plants are going
to dry faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of experience I have with
my dry room and keeping a window open
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes and not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know nothing else changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, it is going to take a little bit
of practice to get your drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: method down right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to ruin a jar or two,
seal that jar up, go to sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: open it the next day and you open it and
it smells like ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might've just kind of killed that
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not moldy, if you don't see any
mold, break it open as small as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get those buds, pour it out on a tray,
let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste it, give it a smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it tastes all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be smokable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you left it in there too long and it
molded up, throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember what you did, fix it next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that same shit again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always start with clean jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean jars, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time today cleaning jars
and thinking, man, this really sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't, you know, but it's,
you know, every little thing counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody tried to cut off their feet
and stick cloning gel on their ankles so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can clone ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we need to make more growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to be a good grower sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much, like you got to do the
growing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to clean up after
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always the part that gets
skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to go start by cleaning
tomorrow and you guys keep your grow rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: clean because it builds up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to clone yourself because
you just can't keep everything going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could, two of me would crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a lot of money and you have no
shame and you want to clean pots and scrub
[SPEAKER_01]: floors and all that and come to Colorado,
learn how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in contact with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just make, did you just offer an
apprenticeship almost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but they got to pay to start the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pay to start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're going to be the employee
that carries buckets and sweeps floors and
[SPEAKER_00]: mops up the shit for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someday they'll be the bombest
dispensary owner there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll teach them how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to pass on these skills to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause one day I'm going to be not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say get hit by a truck or
something, but I didn't want to chase
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I'm going to get hit by a bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm not going to be able to
grow weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bus just flies through the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that a line in a sublime song or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm bulletproof vest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't remember most things off the top
of your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but I'm the second biggest
sublime fan in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second, the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't try to take number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I feel like we've covered
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else to add to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to mess up some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes practice and patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get it right the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do is go, you can open it too
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving it closed too long will screw you
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there and open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think maybe I need to open it,
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have another jar next to
it, don't open that one and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: compare, take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to become a good
grower and a good curer and dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As do I practice it and take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on rehydrating dry
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not a I'm not sponsored by
this company, but the humidipax,
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidipax work great for rehydrating
your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wondering what they'd be like
for long term, long term storage as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of people throw their herb
in a sea vault, which doesn't sponsor me
[SPEAKER_00]: either with a couple of humidipax and
leave it for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to the dried out herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put lettuce or orange peels in your
bags, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I was getting at.
I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'll make mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'll make your stuff not taste
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't add flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will, but not the flavor you want
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be funky flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was I curing herb that you've
possibly purchased from someone,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just trying to help out
listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got an herb that you don't
feel is dry enough, if you've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: patience, you can cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's sticky, you can leave it in the
jar and let it let it kind of dry real
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it in there overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on it in the morning and leave it
open for like 15 minutes and just repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: that every day until it's good or open it
every six hours and check on it if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: impatient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown paper sack, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown paper sacks are great because they
kind of I did this when I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of think that they kind of make a
little bit of a flavor in my buds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also lost a nice amount of weed,
a whole brown paper sandwich bag to mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it sped up the mold process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of feel like they may absorb oils
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can time it right, it's a great
step between the hanging process and the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to leave it out for if you've
got to be away at work all day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know it should be in the jar,
but it's not dry enough for the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bag is probably going to work for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company ideal for someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come up with a brown paper sack that
doesn't have all those issues we just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a canvas bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those vitamin cottage, the old vitamin
cottage shopping bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cured urban those before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it done in a five gallon bucket
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done and seen that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just prefer, I prefer the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it doesn't give me any flavor
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing five gallon buckets,
get the, I try to find the good lids that
[SPEAKER_01]: have the rubber seals in them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And black buckets from the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your weed came in a turkey bag,
it was not dried and cured probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was possibly dried and stacked in a
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it got shipped off to wherever it's
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned this at the beginning of
the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'm going to say that we've covered
the dry and curing for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any more questions,
specific questions, please send me those
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a listener that this episode was
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if she wants her name said on
the air, but she just recently emailed me
[SPEAKER_00]: saying she was excited because I told her
it was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said she was excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I missed anything for you, please let
me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to, I want to make this work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs to be a good dryer and
cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I skipped a whole bunch of grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the show, we got all the way through
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in like mid veg phase just before we
were going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've jumped all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've harvested, we've done outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to the lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been trying to do what's current
and what's relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not trying to mess you up, throw you
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to the lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of the show, I mentioned
that the city council meeting has been
[SPEAKER_00]: moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: City council first planned the meeting for
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew it was a holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still wanted to meet, but they
changed their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meeting will now be Tuesday at seven o
'clock at city hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at one city hall plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said at the beginning of the show here,
it's on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better make sure, but go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, are you going to be there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm committing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little posse coming with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a posse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesdays are actually much better for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday was kind of hard or Monday was
kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tuesday is way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one city hall place Tuesday at
seven PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to speak, you have to be there
about six thirty and sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, if you're going to speak,
try to have some education about what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in there and cuss them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give them the finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people yell at city council
before trying to prove a point,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and try to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a suit and a jacket,
wear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you just.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do it right, nobody will have to
speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do it right, a lot of us will show
up and we've got a spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who I would rather have speak for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, get there first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go every week, get there, sign up,
speak our part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike knows exactly what to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we need a spokesperson, he'll sign
up and he definitely will speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully after he speaks, they just deny
the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're looking for hasn't even been
submitted to or what they're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't been shown to them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to preempt this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be like, oh, shit, then maybe
we shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they don't want to mess with all 60
of us sitting there at the city council
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telling them why it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just go, okay, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, sometimes, especially on a
Tuesday after a holiday, no one's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in the mood to sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys come out, please come out and
support us at the city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Pueblo, Colorado,
and you were not working or babysitting or
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting your own children or harvesting
your own plants or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need a really good excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke pot, if you grow cannabis in
the city of Pueblo or the county,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to come to this meeting because
this applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: To you, please come support us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a chance to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is real activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, you know, not Facebook or Instagram
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, you know, and come meet Jesse and
I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound like a real huge deal,
but I mean, that's some incentive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give me show ideas for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to meet you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to meet the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met a couple of people, but yeah,
so yeah, I'd love to meet more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm just too damn high for my
own good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I really appreciate
seeing him too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even say appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys for listening
to the cure lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you've got questions,
please let us know because we're as dabbed
[SPEAKER_00]: out as you and we may have gone over
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of experienced and sometimes we
forget the small details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still furiously trying to think of
something that we skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they'll email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Twitter will light up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like, you missed this part,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will actually be posted in
like three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will have listened to it within
four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend that's listening late at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap up this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got any shout outs or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, baby?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: High grow Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: High grow Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come see me down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still waiting on someone to come dab me
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got punched in the arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burn was listening to the episode last
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just throw that in there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bad influence on Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a bad influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go to high grow Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also support highly educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the new coupon code at
nature's green remedies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your purchase at nature's green remedies
helps keep homeless people in the Detroit
[SPEAKER_00]: area warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting cold as shit up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also don't forget, I need somebody to go
and count how many times I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The F word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I said it at all in this
episode, so we're making progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, we talked about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guests can say whatever they want
because I like you to be yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I got to be a good host and be a good
little boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that coupon code again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never said that, did I?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coupon code helping hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be a helping hand, give a
helping hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two words, helping hands,
hands plural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So type that in at nature's green remedies
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works for any brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics is currently sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now the popcorn is popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give it just a few weeks here and I'll
refill them and everybody will be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, guys, join the forum at I read
genetics, colorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to say I read genetics colorado
.com, but the cotton mouth made my face
[SPEAKER_00]: stick together so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what even came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll just do this rap part of the
show while Jesse sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I play some music and come back
and end it, but there's no reason to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a break because we're on a roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Hey, please go leave me some comments

[SPEAKER_00]: I am still making those videos for
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've posted 11 videos now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are nothing fancy, but they get the
point across so that people on YouTube can
[SPEAKER_00]: catch the show.

the better.
