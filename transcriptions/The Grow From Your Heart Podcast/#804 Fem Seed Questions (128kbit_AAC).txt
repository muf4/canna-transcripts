[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 803 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk a
little bit about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about the free seeds later
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of free seeds, this episode will
come out the day of the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to put it out just a bit
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to this episode before the
Dude Grows Cup starts, come to my booth
[SPEAKER_00]: and say the word kangaroo and I will give
you a special prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't make it to the Dude Grows
Cup, make sure you check out my website,
[SPEAKER_00]: iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great seeds up there at a
lot of great prices and every order does
[SPEAKER_00]: come with free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all the business I need to
cover here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move our way into everybody's
favorite part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the question and answer section of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from the Grow Help tab
on the iREGENETICS website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to iregenetics.com, there's a
row of tabs on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them does say grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will give you the opportunity to ask
your grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I read your grow question here on
the podcast, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You win free iREGENETIC seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first question came from our friend
Justin Case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy, Justin Case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name pop up a lot on social
media, a lot on the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, please do subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your real name and a good shipping
address because you, my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: win a free pack of iREGENETIC seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving the genetics, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad they're working well for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do have a grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, because that's what we are here for,
my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I want to make some feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I have the ingredients for the
STS solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to make their own silver
thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want full instructions on how to
make that, in my method, I've done a full
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called My STS Mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to YouTube, search for that,
or I should drop a link in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: video or possibly in the, wherever you're
watching or listening, there should be a
[SPEAKER_00]: link.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there should be a link to the STS
solution video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you where to buy everything,
how to mix it, and mostly how to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question does say, I would love to
know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any tips, do I spray just
the nodes before there are flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: expecting both sex parts to develop on the
area spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this whole plant going to respond?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the answers from our friend,
Justin Case, bro, Justin Case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recently done a podcast that
covered a lot of this, but I realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not have talked a lot about actually
spraying the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you start reversing this plant,
what I would recommend, and I've done a
[SPEAKER_00]: full episode on this, so this will be kind
of a, just a quick refresher.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I recommend is spraying the plant
seven to 10 days before you put that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower, pull that plant out of the
room, maybe put some newspaper or
[SPEAKER_00]: something on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it where the floor needs
to stay clean, because when you apply,
[SPEAKER_00]: apply the solution, it may turn white
walls or white things, a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe put something down, move the
plant out to their spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now wait seven to 10 days and do this
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spray the plant seven to 10
days before flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spray it on day one,
three, six, nine, 12, 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18, 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plant is being stubborn,
I will spray it again on day 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my own personal preference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just experiment with that last day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what to expect when you first spray the
plant, you might not see anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first spray the plant,
that plant may react strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants react very differently to different
dilutions and dosages of the STS
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you spray a plant, you don't
notice anything happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you spray a plant, and tomorrow
it looks like those leaves are going
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're balled up, they're curling,
they're twisting, they're changing colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does look stressful, but keep in
mind, we're not growing this plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: photogenic purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to make buds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to make flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're disrupting this plant's entire
hormonal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see weird reactions from
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main focus is that this plant does
produce pollen for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes, like I said, those leaves
are going to go crazy, crinkly,
[SPEAKER_00]: twisty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to be expected in some cases with
reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that plant didn't want that much
silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it needed more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they just basically freak out
when we do reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may see some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry too much unless the plant is
dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not getting any reaction to
cause the pollen sacs to form and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's looking like shit, then you're
probably over spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to tell until you're
actually doing it how much spray to give
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have recommended dosage rates in my
podcast that I made earlier, but you do
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do some experimenting and some
adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some weird shit from the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, you'll see little nubbins pop
up where your flowers normally form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say this microphone is the top of
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally you get little pistols starting
to pop up and little little brachial form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, you're going to see it's going to
look like little balls popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are where the pollen sacs are
going to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's mainly the first few things to
look for and to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I spray the nodes before the flowers
expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the question is, do I spray the nodes
when I'm spraying silver thiosulfate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray it from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work my way up and I spray the tops of
the leaves and the bottoms of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely spray the center stock
and every branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get as much of this silver into the
plant as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to pesticide applications,
I may focus more on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the silver, I am trying
to get the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to spray it till it's
dripping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just a little bit of droplets coming
off, but not running off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that silver to stay on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it all to drip off and fall
off the plant and end up in the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spray the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, do I spray just the nodes
before there are flowers you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to spray early?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I expect both sex parts to develop on
the area sprayed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I've talked about this
previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you spray one branch of a
plant, sometimes that plant is real
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive and the entire plant will
reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you spray one branch of a
plant, the plant is super stubborn and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will not reverse at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you spray one branch of a
plant, it will do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magic best thing you could happen,
it will make pollen on that one branch and
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the plant will stay female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either smoke the rest of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend it if you spray it with
silver, but it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can pollinate the other side of
that plant with your one side that is
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the part that you spray is going to
reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that you don't spray possibly
will not reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part is very plant specific,
very phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant will react differently to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I'm going to recap that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you will select one branch and
spray that one branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it reverses the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it just reverses that one
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on that plant and how
it reacts to the silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now part of your question was what can I
expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we've learned how to spray the
plant properly, other things that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect are around day 26 to 32,
you should start seeing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't move the female plants into the
breeding room until I am sure that this
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means to me is when I see,
you'll be able to tell, you'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: something's way different on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the female flowers don't look like
female flowers, they look like male
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I am sure of that, when I can verify
that the reversal is working, that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the female plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that times it pretty well because by
the time the pollen starts dropping from
[SPEAKER_00]: that reversal, those females will be
reaching their peak ovulation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a big tip, a big hint,
and definitely something to look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the reversal is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've talked about that extra day of
spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cultivars are stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stop spraying, they will revert and
go right back to female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be your longer flowering
cultivars that need that extra spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got something that goes a
little bit longer, maybe you've got an 11
[SPEAKER_00]: or 12 week flowering plant, those are the
plants where I would consider that one
[SPEAKER_00]: extra spray of the STS solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this should answer the bulk of
your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main part of the question was do I
have any tips and what to expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look out for those male parts to
form on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then work on the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see those male parts forming,
move the females into the room with that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and then you should time everything
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, just in case, I feel like I've
answered this question pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part is what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect that female to start showing you
signs that it is reversing into a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see those signs,
move that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I recommend is document when
that pollen drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if you wanna make more seeds,
also document everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document how you made the STS solution,
what dilutions it was when you sprayed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also document when that pollen starts
to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do wanna make more seeds,
we've got a little bit of a guideline,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a timeline, a little bit
of a heads up, some experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: and documentation to remind us what
happened last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I spray the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that, and we talked about
which part is going to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after you do all the pollination,
then the next important part is to let
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds finish, and then you get to
the fun part, harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them, and then see what you've
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, just in case, thank you for the
great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, please do send me your address
because I owe you a pack of iry genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this party moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from the grow help tab
on the iry genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if you've got a grow question,
go to the iry genetics website,
[SPEAKER_00]: find that grow help tab, send me your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the show,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You win a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next free pack of seeds goes to our
friend Smurf Grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Smurf Grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your address and a real
name so that I can get you a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, I have a breeding
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When making fem seeds, do you chop down
and remove the reversed plant like you
[SPEAKER_00]: would a regular male?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, when do I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the help from Smurf
Grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question because a lot
of us are limited on plant count,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't need that male sticking
around too long because we want to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant count space with an actual
female plant that we can do something
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you have that extra male sticking
around, putting you in limbo for your
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why you may want to get rid
of that male and not have them around too
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to clean up and get the next
project going with the male around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does kind of slow things and give you
some obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do when I make seeds,
most of the time, I like to pollinate two
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let my pollen donor develop a
nice big batch of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do the pollen tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tap that plant or shake that plant,
let the pollen get into the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes put it right in front of the
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get some pollen in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll wait five to 10 more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's about seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in there a week later and that plant
has developed more pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's built up more pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had some time to chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a sandwich and a Gatorade.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's ready to make another mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and sprinkle that pollen
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that second pollination,
I generally cut the plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that big main top and I'll cut
that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to gather the pollen,
I'll put that big top in a Pyrex dish and
[SPEAKER_00]: just let it sit for a couple days and get
real dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm able to remove that pollen,
store it, collect it, and keep it for
[SPEAKER_00]: future uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, if I don't want that pollen
for the future, because most of the time I
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly don't store pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got live plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do live breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my breeding style.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times what I will do is I'll take
that the main top of that plant and a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of the other bigger buds,
the male flowers, and I will hang them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room strategically over other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just hang them there for a couple
of days and they will dry up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the room, the plant has been cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it dries, that pollen naturally falls
out of the plant onto the other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that need to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one more way to get a
little bit more pollen out of my reversal
[SPEAKER_00]: because honestly, the reversals do not
make a lot of pollen compared to a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I get about maybe a third as much
pollen from a reversal as I do from a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular male pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pollinate two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chuck the pollen the one time,
give them a week to build another pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck that other second load of pollen,
then cut the tops off and hang them upside
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them hang for a couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll naturally drop a little bit of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after that, once I'm tired of
seeing them there, I'll pull down the tops
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll smack it against the fan or
against the other plants or something just
[SPEAKER_00]: in an effort to knock out that very last
bit of pollen and get it in the room so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can get as many seeds as possible because
like I said, reversals are stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get as much pollen as you could
from a regular male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't give you the big cloud,
the bunch of dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have to use multiple pollen
donor plants just to fill the room with
[SPEAKER_00]: enough pollen to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is when the plant goes,
in my experience, in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives me one load of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives me another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I cut him down and I actually am able
to get more pollen from him a third time
[SPEAKER_00]: by smacking against the wall or the fan or
something like that or just beating it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once he's done, he's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get him out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do it after the second round of
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude Smurf, thank you for
the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your shipping address
and like I've said before, I will not send
[SPEAKER_00]: a box to Smurf Grown, no offense,
but that's how we just cause problems for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a real name on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody will have any questions and it will
make it to you that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants their seeds to get to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have one more great
question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from that Grow Help
tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Marley's
Grow Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my friend Marley's Grow Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what, Marley, if you haven't caught
on by now, you win a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do send me your shipping address
and once again, a real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I can get your seeds to you
promptly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question does go a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says good evening Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm sending love and good vibes
from the Show Me State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends in the
Show Me State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Show Me Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been listening to your
podcast for some time now and I absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: love the vast variety of information you
give out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to unpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot to be thankful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening for a long time and
thanks for thinking that I'm giving you a
[SPEAKER_00]: vast variety of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that sometimes I do get stuck
into the breeding questions because those
[SPEAKER_00]: are my favorites, but I really do try to
mix it up, have a variety of info that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says much love, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says so I recently found a female plant
that I would love to breed with and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: still pretty new to that side of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it works, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was asking me recently how I do
selections for breeding and I was like it
[SPEAKER_00]: just sometimes they just they just talk to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a crazy person,
but the plant I'll be looking in a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room of a thousand plants and I'll go that
one and there's just something about a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that speaks to me as a breeder as a
grower that just says hey you should breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a plant just jumped up and
said hey I need you because these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are here doing their own thing and it
knows that it needs you to breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant called on you and got your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I absolutely dig this girl and how
well she handles stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great trait for a breeding plant
and even smokes and produces some flower
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you got a true winner
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I absolutely dig this girl away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I skip some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm on the hunt for a good male to
bring into the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings me one quick question right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this plant is so amazing and so
perfect, why do you want to breed to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is that do you want to improve it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to reproduce it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to add those traits to
something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious what your goal is because
a lot of breeding is all based on that
[SPEAKER_00]: goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know what you plan to do with
this perfect plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it to be a contributor to a
project, if you want to carry that line
[SPEAKER_00]: on, if you want to see what it does when
you mix it with other shit, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: curious what your intentions and your goal
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says for the strain I love,
would I be better to hunt a male to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with or stick with the female to carry on
the traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this makes sense in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the good time sir and much
love from Marley's Grow Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this totally makes sense and that's
kind of what I was touching on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a few options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to reproduce this plant
for preservation purposes, if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make more seeds of this plant just to see
what it does, we've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our options is to make feminized
selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the first things I would do
for preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this plant has really got your
attention, it would be heartbreaking if we
[SPEAKER_00]: lost this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we could take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we great, but shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the power goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have fires, floods and
disasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't, but that shit does
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of those things were to happen,
it would be great to have a backup supply
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really easy way to do that is to cut two
clones, spray one with silver,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't spray the other, apply the pollen to
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will make feminized seeds of your
favorite cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 30% of those seeds will grow
to look just like the plant that you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some plants that look like
the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants look like the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be some plants that look like
some totally weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant that you are seeking will be
in that preservation pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first batch of preservation pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got other options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do true breeding to a male
to a female, I would find a male that
[SPEAKER_00]: complements that female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I always find successful,
I find a plant that is the opposite of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I am breeding to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know anything about your
breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that it is tall,
it is slender, and it tastes like lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find something short and squatty
that tasted like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they're so vastly different
that when you combine those, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make brand new, amazing shit with a lot
of great opportunities, a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bred your tall, slender lemon plant
to a tall, slender lemon plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just making more fucking tall,
slender lemon plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bring that tall, slender lemon to a
tall, slender strawberry, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get tall, slender strawberries and lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to make something new and
different instead of just copying the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless that is your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to find a male that just
helps you to produce seeds from this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my favorite things to do is to
take one male plant and pollinate multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can see what that male plant is
bringing to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you reverse it, you can actually
pollinate more females as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different females in you can still see
what that reversal adds to the mix as a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your first option, one of your options
is to reverse this plant, make fem seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can breed it to a male that is
vastly different than that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you brand new crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got that brand new cross,
then I would consider doing a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the perfect female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would find a male plant that looks
just like the original female that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would breed that male to the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you made your back cross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would find another male out of that
batch of seeds that looks just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed it back to that original mom again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a back cross too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you're going to make seeds that
make exact copies around F5, F6.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should make exact stable copies of the
plant you are working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does make great sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without knowing what your overall goal
is and without knowing what you want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with this plant, what your vision is,
what your dream is, I don't know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the ways to guide you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that your options, you can
reverse this plant or you can pollinate it
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your selection of the male is going to
make a big influence on the future of this
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to open it up and bring out
brand new shit or do you want to dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: the traits that you already like?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you make breeding decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love that you're inspired to breed
and I love that you come to me for
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
