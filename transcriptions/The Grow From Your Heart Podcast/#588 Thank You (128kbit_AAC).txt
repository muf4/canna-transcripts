[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff, and this is episode 588 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna start this episode with any
advertising, we're not gonna talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm smoking, and there are no Patreon
shout outs to start the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to come in and do a quick thank
you holiday podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I owe everybody listening to
this show a big thank you shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening since the very
beginning, if you jumped in somewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle, or even if this is your very
first episode, I want to say thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the show and for supporting
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank everybody who
supports iRead Genetics and all things
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without your trust and inspiration and
support, the podcast and the seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: would not be nearly as successful as they
are, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also want to take this opportunity
to say thanks for a few things I am
[SPEAKER_00]: thankful for and grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are obviously living in trying times
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are dealing with a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has ruined people's health and people's
businesses and people's mental well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start by saying that I am
very thankful and grateful that this
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic has not disrupted my business and
my health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My company is still thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have watched this pandemic take lives of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have watched this pandemic destroy
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched this pandemic destroy people
financially, physically, and emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am very thankful and grateful that
it hasn't gotten to me this far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a strong person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good team around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm very grateful for all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to express that gratitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very thankful to be healthy and that
my business has survived through this
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that I am very grateful and
thankful for what I consider success.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in my life, I think I am
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has taken me a long time to relax and
say, bro, I'm successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of settle down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I have made a mark in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am proud of who and what I am at this
point in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watch a lot of people around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that everybody can say
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people who have reached that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, I always want to get to where
that guy is or that woman is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm fucking there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident and secure with who and what
I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at this point in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm grateful and thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I could pass away today and
this company would survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not live tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to think about that,
but it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all pass away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this company, the seed company and the
podcast will thrive for years without me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the internet doesn't go away,
as long as YouTube doesn't go away,
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will keep learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will be educating themselves
through this podcast for years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have put out countless seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seeds all over the world being
grown by people that love, trust and
[SPEAKER_00]: respect my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seeds will continue to be grown
for decades and generations to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make clones from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully people breed with them and carry
on the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel in my opinion, that is success.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my life, my work is going to live on
and continue to improve the life of
[SPEAKER_00]: others, I feel like I am successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could kind of catch my breath and count
my blessings at this time, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing here together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm not just bragging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may sound like I'm bragging and coming
and saying, Hey, I've got a cool podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also reminding you to be grateful and
thankful for what you have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to share gratitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to express gratitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need to be reminded of
gratitude and the things you're grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your health.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a little cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have some health problems,
but you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking living.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got earbuds in your ears and you're
listening to this podcast, which means you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably have some sort of a device to
watch or listen on, which means your
[SPEAKER_00]: health and your wealth are doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to be fucking super
athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need stacks of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be grateful for what we've got
and enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be grateful and share some gratitude
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a couple other things I want to talk
about that I'm really grateful for is that
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom and my daughter are safe and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably two of the most
important people in my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did lose a couple of very important
people to me in the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss them dearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my uncles who I lost this
year, but I'm grateful that my mom and my
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter are still here without those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the most important peoples in my
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of inspiration right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to kind of segue into
things that aren't as heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking grateful and thankful for the
fact that we hit 5,000 YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 over 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
we're at about 5.1K.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increased rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thankful and grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another sign of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another sign that all of my hard work,
my dedication, my commitment are paying
[SPEAKER_00]: off, which shows success, which that
success contributes to my health and my
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just, I say health and wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things involving that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mental health, my physical health,
my wellbeing, which means that I'm making
[SPEAKER_00]: an income, which means I can feed myself
to eat healthily and feed myself the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those types of things tie in
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the 5,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to say thank you for all of
the relationships I have built in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made so many friends through
Instagram, through Cannabuzz, through
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra shout out to the Patreon folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a ton of friends through YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made friends on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make friends every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not online, it's going somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's at the grow store, if it's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just meet people at a
restaurant randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recognize my voice and they go,
hey, you're Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give them an air fist bump from
across the room because we're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've made many, many great
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so many new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to start giving shout outs
because I'll skip somebody and feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am so grateful for the team of
friends that I have built through this
[SPEAKER_00]: company, through this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I need technical help,
if I need camera help, if I need computer
[SPEAKER_00]: help, I feel like I've got the grow stuff
figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got friends who are on the level
of grow knowledge which I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends who have computer knowledge
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends with camera knowledge like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends with lighting knowledge
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I have questions, I reach out
to those folks and they supply me with all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the knowledge that I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very grateful to have that team and
just the friendship, the camaraderie,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trust, the relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people from Cannabuzz that I've
never met in person that we have long
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations late at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be up packaging seeds and I'll just
get a little message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have funny conversations that
best friends who have known each other
[SPEAKER_00]: since high school would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we met on Cannabuzz and Cannabuzz has
only been an app for like a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really grateful for all of these
amazing deep friendships and relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: I have developed through this company,
through this podcast, through the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community, through the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: People look up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: People respect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay humble and just be a normal
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a normal dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up with eye boogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to pee and I got hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My life is just a normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am very grateful to have such a
large friend circle, support team,
[SPEAKER_00]: support group, an audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to think of you as my
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can reach out to you and if I need
someone to talk to, you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need some tech help, you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shit is priceless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't wanna ramble on too long and
sound like a, I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna get all sappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry,
but I wanna thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without you, I would just be talking into
a camera and this may be a sign of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: mental illness if you guys weren't on the
other end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably be considered a psychopath if
I just did this twice a week and nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: listened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the support, the trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying the same thing, but it does
mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also thankful to be here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very blessed to be this guy in this
position in this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not Rasta Jeff to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people around here don't call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, hey, you fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they say dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking grateful to be Rasta Jeff of
iRegenetics, but I'm glad to be Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be Maya's dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be my mom's son.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be all of my friends' friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the podcast guy, the seed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking thankful to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken me several years to be
confident and secure and comfortable with
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, this is me and I've
never been more comfortable, proud,
[SPEAKER_00]: secure, confident of what I am and what
I've got to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is because of the feedback
that I've gotten from you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the bottom of my heart,
the top of my lungs, fucking thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna let you guys get back to
your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go spread some gratitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go tell somebody thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell somebody you love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread the vibe that I have given you just
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
