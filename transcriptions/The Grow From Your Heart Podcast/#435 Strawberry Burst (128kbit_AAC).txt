[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of garlic
grove, full spectrum extract from Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a blend of GMO cookies and LOAF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says the flavor should taste
like orange soda and garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of tastes like I took a bite of
garlicky mashed potatoes and then I washed
[SPEAKER_00]: it down with a kiwi strawberry Snapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really delicious flavor,
a really complex flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strawberry, maybe an orange soda
flavor, kind of lingers on my tongue for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the buzz is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes right to my eyes, right to my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm dabbing the garlic grove,
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot.

[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I said we were
going to talk about one of my new favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to do a strain
review on Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to catch everybody up before we talk
about my strains, I am Rasta Jeff from
[SPEAKER_00]: iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the breeder and sole proprietor of
iRegenetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I create high quality regular and
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My most popular regular seed line has
become the Arise and my most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed line so far has become the
Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to focus on
one of my favorite creations and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: my Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Strawberry Starburst?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Starburst is a cross of a
female Strawberry Fields from Crockett
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms crossed to a male Arise from
iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about that Strawberry
Fields from Crockett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Fields is a cross of Strawberry
Banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got that tropical sweet
Strawberry Banana sort of a flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it was pollinated by a male Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male Tangy gave it a really citrusy,
orangey kind of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it came out, it's sort of like a
Strawberry Banana Orange Julius is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to describe that Strawberry
Fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how it is grown and where it
is grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it'll get a really strong
strawberry candy sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it gets more of that orange
creamy kind of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the grower,
the environment and the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, it tastes very much
like an Orange Julius, maybe with a hint
[SPEAKER_00]: of banana in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely has a lot of strawberry
candy dominating the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the aroma and flavors that
come from this Strawberry Fields plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of what inspired me to breed
it to my Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that inspired me to breed
it to my Arise was the size of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant already made monster colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found Strawberry Fields in a commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took over running a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already had the Strawberry Fields in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that every time I ran that plant,
I would hit my harvest weights and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: get bonuses because it puts out huge,
giant colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good reason to breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing it was missing was super
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produced gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has amazing flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the finished product always lacked a
little bit of potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like everything else in the garden
was hitting a little bit harder with lab
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in today's market, the lab tests mean
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just could not get that Strawberry
Fields to hit the test that everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else was hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that by pollinating that strawberry
with Arise, I could increase that hyper
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could potentially increase that giant
bud potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that I would increase the
potency because that is one thing that my
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise male does to everything it
pollinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a good way to segue into
talking about my male Arise plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a cross of a Golden Goat female
pollinated by a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is from Gage Green Genetics and
it is a cross of Chem D and Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a lot of gassy, funky,
wonderful aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotype I used had really large,
really wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth structure was perfect for my
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used the male Daybreaker and I
pollinated the female Golden Goat to
[SPEAKER_00]: create the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to listen to that episode,
it is number 329.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 329 is available on iTunes,
Stitcher and YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also available in a playlist titled
Strain Descriptions on my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, the YouTube channel, look for the
[SPEAKER_00]: playlist titled Strain Descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find a long list of Strain
Description episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like the Strain Descriptions,
I saved them all for you right there in
[SPEAKER_00]: one playlist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a listen and please leave some
comments and let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus on this episode about
Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things you will notice
about Strawberry Starburst are the aromas
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These buds smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that by telling you about that
Strawberry Fields mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably got a pretty good idea of
what the Strawberry Starburst will taste
[SPEAKER_00]: and smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got that strawberry candy sort of a
thing going on, but then it has a funky
[SPEAKER_00]: undertone to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something that is really
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious and strawberry candy like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It carries that, that tropical flavor,
but then it's just got a dirty foot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you've got, maybe you've got
like a whole bag of strawberries and then
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you got some watermelon slices in
there and maybe there's a couple of kiwi
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, but also it's like you got a
foot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not a whole foot, but maybe like a
couple of really ripe toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got strawberry dominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some watermelon, maybe a hint of
kiwi in there, but then definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of dirty toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not an entire wookie foot,
but there are a couple of toes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable and they're just stinking it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is strawberry dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still brings that orange, Julius creamy
sort of a thing, but it is mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some watermelon to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I keep saying, there is a
hint of dirty, funky feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That skunky rank smell at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you inhale and it's nice and sweet
and then you blow it out and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite kind of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it tastes and smells like
when it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more of a fresh, ripe strawberry
like the fruit, but as it gets riper,
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts to develop that strawberry
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then throughout the drying and curing
process, you really start to bring out
[SPEAKER_00]: that strawberry candy aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes more watermelon aroma will come
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes more of that orange,
Julius creamy sort of thing will come out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does make some delicious fruity
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about her
growth structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth structure of strawberry fields
is very predictable since it came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: arise male and the strawberry fields
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is going to get fairly tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes grow quite tall,
so flower a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also notice they are quite
vigorous early in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants grow with what I call hyper
vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to get larger than
all of your other plants that are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to get tall and
they are going to make a lot of long
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be a lot of space between the
branches, so you'll have a nice tight
[SPEAKER_00]: inner node space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you may notice that when the
branches do start to grow out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will have distance between where the
bud sites look like they are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay because the buds grow so
large that they will fill in all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it looks like you've got a lot of
space between bud sites, expect that to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill in by the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is just giving itself some
space and some room to make monster colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you crowd strawberry starburst in too
tight, it will get frustrated and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tall and skinny and it won't branch
out the way that it should and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: will get really stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend giving it plenty of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you crowd it in, it is not going to
benefit you by doing too many plants per
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one needs some breathing room and
some stretching out space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst will get tall and it
will have a lot of long branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can become unruly if you don't give
her some sort of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: She responds very well to any type of LST,
any type of supercropping, any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting, any type of trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes that sort of stuff and it just
makes her grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really suggest doing a lot of popping
and twisting of the branches for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks of flower because that will
really help slow down your 21-day stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst does respond well to
being topped, but if you do not top her,
[SPEAKER_00]: she will make a monstrous top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for one of those
gigantic buds to take great photos of,
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst will give you amazing
photogenic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you do decide to top your
strawberry starburst plant and spread it
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit, give it plenty of time
to recover from that topping and you will
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lot of monstrous size buds from your
screen of green setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it plenty of time to recover
from the topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said that it does make long
branches with a little bit of space
[SPEAKER_00]: between the bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spread those branches out and give
each of those bud sites some space to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, you will get a good size bud on each
of those spaces just depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, your environment, and mainly your
lighting and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you spread it out properly,
this plant will give you huge production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's going to get big and she's going
to grow very quickly, but if you train her
[SPEAKER_00]: and take good care of her, she will be a
very productive plant for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not going to put it in some sort
of a screen, I definitely recommend giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it some sort of sticks, some sort of
steaks, some sort of tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will need something to support the buds
because they are going to get really long
[SPEAKER_00]: and really floppy early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, you're going to need
supports around week five or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely say have them in there
by the end of week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst does react well to
defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like to do a moderate defoliation,
you can do so with strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does not like being stripped,
but she does like being moderately heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how hard you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we can go a
little bit hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't strip strawberry starburst down
until she's naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: She needs a few leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got those skinny long leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: She needs a few of those to keep her
photosynthesis going, to keep herself
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't strip her too naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about
nutrients and feeding strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most grows, I am using new millennium
bottled nutrients, veg bloom powder
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, or a combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen strawberry starburst thrive
with both of those setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some of the best strawberry
starburst I have ever smelled or smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: was grown in a no-till bed that has been
running for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strawberry starburst seems to like all
types of nutrient setups, all types of
[SPEAKER_00]: feed environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's running in a commercial environment
right now, and it is crushing it with new
[SPEAKER_00]: millennium and veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also in a no-till garden right now
with a Clackamas Coop mix that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: going for four years, and it is crushing
it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to really enjoy all types of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can tell you, it is a heavy
feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst will grow quickly in
veg, and when you flip it into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is going to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants receive 90% of their
nitrogen during their veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you flip these plants to flower,
make sure you are not nitrogen deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaves are yellowing, if your
growth is slowing, you may be nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient, and you don't want to go into
flower chasing that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to your leaves,
pay attention to your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see slow growth or yellowing
leaves, you are probably macronutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient, and you need to feed some base
nutrients, maybe some Kalmag, and boost up
[SPEAKER_00]: those macronutrients before you go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go into flower if you
are already deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's talk about flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest flipping these plants into
flower early because they are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow very quickly in veg, and they are
going to take off as soon as you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes of strawberry starburst
will typically finish flowering in 9 to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a couple of outliers that
will finish a little earlier, and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a phenotype that does take a little bit
longer, but typically 9 to 10 weeks is the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest window for most phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is a great way to segue
into talking about common phenotypes of
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst is an F1 hybrid,
so there definitely will be variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variation is expected in an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to see phenotypes that very
closely represent the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to see phenotypes that very
closely represent that strawberry field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to see some phenotypes that
are perfect 50-50 combos, and we should
[SPEAKER_00]: see some phenotypes that look 75%
strawberry fields, 25% Arise, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: will find the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% Arise, 25% strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the phenotypes we typically find
in this F1 cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within that variation, there are a
couple of very recognizable phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite is the one that I call the
spongy or the jagged phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of looks like a loofah sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have a really pretty bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are gigantic, but they are shaped
kind of oddly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one has an amazing strawberry aroma
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one makes the best concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to talk about that here in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that strawberry starburst phenotype
that isn't super tight, the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to fluff out a little bit later in
flower, that one is going to make amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a concentrate maker,
that is a plant to be on the search for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another phenotype that comes from
strawberry starburst that is very easily
[SPEAKER_00]: identifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful 50-50 combination of the
strawberry fields and the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings that gassy, cushy aroma from the
Daybreaker, and then it also brings that
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet strawberry cream flavor from the
strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has got a gassy, creamy strawberry
sort of aroma, and then the growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: it grows more like Arise because it stays
a little bit shorter and a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: stout, but that top bud gets real big and
real jagged and has a real mean look to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I call the 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is another very common phenotype
that comes from the strawberry starburst,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just call it my favorite phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one looks more like Arise,
but it smells just like strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got the shorter growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit branchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit tighter in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are a little bit larger,
a little bit broader, but these phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: taste just like strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is not real fruit strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more like that strawberry candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a strawberry candy that comes
wrapped in a foil with a strawberry print
[SPEAKER_00]: on the packaging, and I think that this
phenotype of strawberry starburst tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: just like those strawberry candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the other phenotypes have more of
a real strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste like the fruit, or maybe some
of them actually taste like a strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think these phenotypes of strawberry
starburst taste more like that strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: hard candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a second ago, I said that strawberry
starburst makes some of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Kelvin grew strawberry
starburst, and my friend Pedro from
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedro's Grow Room pressed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not a fan of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've listened to this podcast
regularly, you've heard me say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Kelvin grew that strawberry starburst
and brought it to my house, I smelled it
[SPEAKER_00]: and said, that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took that flower up to Denver and we
had Pedro press it at the Dude Grows Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that concentrate was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best rosin I have ever smoked
that was pressed from a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted like a strawberry fruit roll-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the strawberry starburst rosin changed
my complete opinion on smoking rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of rosin still,
but if you've got strawberry starburst
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, I would definitely take a big old
fat dab, and then I would probably take
[SPEAKER_00]: another one in just a couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the basic of strawberry
starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work into some of the finer details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes, like I mentioned earlier,
will be heavy feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let your plants get macronutrient
before you go into flower, and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention in early flower that you are not
getting macronutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you are going to get gigantic buds
if you grow these plants properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to topple over if you don't
have some way to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also suggest plenty of airflow and
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get giant buds, you do give
yourself potential for giant problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, strawberry starburst plants do take
a little longer than some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, nine to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to cut down at week
nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these phenotypes may need that
extra week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take no plant before it's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these plants are very vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for rapid growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to flower earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need some sort of supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need some trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need supports for your buds
earlier than you were used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about strawberry
starburst is she seems to be very easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make her clone very well,
and all of my other friends who have given
[SPEAKER_00]: me grow reports say that she clones very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another note that I wrote down was low pH
for color and low temp for color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in bloom, if you really want to
bring out some great colors, if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring out some purples, maybe some
pinks, some gold and red type hues,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower the temperatures later in flower,
and you will absolutely bring out some
[SPEAKER_00]: magnificently beautiful colors for the
strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've said this earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut her down too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst likes to chunk out on
the last week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you cut down too early, you may rip
yourself off for a little bit of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants like to bulk up right at the
very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't cut them down too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're paying attention to your
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you start seeing some amber
trichomes, you need to start considering
[SPEAKER_00]: your harvest day, but do not cut down too
early because like I said, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to bulk up late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst plants do create a
lot of aroma, but fortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of it is kind of a sweeter,
candier, creamier sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So odor control is still important,
but you're not going to have that gassy,
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky funk blasting out of the grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need something that isn't skunky
and isn't real chem doggie and real OG
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy, maybe something that can blend in a
little better, maybe for growing by a
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry field, or maybe you're growing
by an orange orchard, or maybe if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got lilacs or lilies or something that
puts off a sweet smell near you,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe strawberry starburst plants could
blend right in and not get you so much
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for you for
strawberry starburst.
