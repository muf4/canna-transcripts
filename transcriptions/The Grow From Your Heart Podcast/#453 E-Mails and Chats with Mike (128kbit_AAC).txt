[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 453 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table from me is White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's having a wonderful
evening, daytime, nighttime, afternoon,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever time it is, wherever the fuck you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're having a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're smoking something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're hanging out with somebody
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got a nice buzz on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in your cubicle and you can't
smoke, if you're at work and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I have got you covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are plenty medicated here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a dab for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a dab for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, this podcast is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds, auto was the one I almost
[SPEAKER_00]: forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even got auto flowers, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can find them at seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do like to start the podcast off by
talking about what we are smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I said we took a dab for you just
in case you're curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dab was Bananarama Ambrosia from our
friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says 70.1% THC,
which is not a high number, but I got lit
[SPEAKER_00]: from smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says total cannabinoids,
81% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's got to be some CBD or some THCV
or something different in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I lost the thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike lost his train of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working, whatever the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bananarama.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really interesting aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the more, dude, you're jumping
right on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a, I said it tastes like jello
shots and I haven't had a jello shot in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred years, but it's got that green
jello, not the band, but the snack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the green jello sort of a flavor
to it, aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lemon lime jello-y sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Apothecary
Farms for the Bananarama Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast ruled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently discovered a new website that
provides a lot of information for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you the name of the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might look to me as if I may do my
advertising voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were joking about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did find a website where I can find a
lot of podcast reviews, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want me to give them money for some
more stuff, but the free stuff is very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of useful stats on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see my rankings on Stitcher and
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is all of the iTunes
customer reviews, all of the Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews, they are all compiled into one
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: One helpful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize, I think I knew it,
but I don't think I ever thought about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that iTunes is broken down by country and
there are folks in other countries that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been leaving reviews on the podcast,
which we are not able to discover through-
[SPEAKER_01]: That we don't see through the platform we
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, because they've got a different
library and just a different algorithm and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to worry about what all the
tech technical stuff is, but my point is
[SPEAKER_00]: there are other reviews which we have been
missing.
That we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that it's really creepy,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mic is so low that it comes weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more reviews and I think that we
need to take a minute and read some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews from some of our friends from
other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be discriminatory if we didn't do
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to leave out, speaking of
discriminatory, I'm going to leave out the
[SPEAKER_00]: US iTunes customer reviews because they're
easily accessible on the iTunes which I
[SPEAKER_00]: normally find.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on our foreign
friends for these next couple of reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: International and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after we do a couple of reviews
we are going to jump into some listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this review was left on May 9th
and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention that this one was left by
Big Baz on Apple Podcasts from Great
[SPEAKER_00]: Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the comment goes, I would highly
recommend listening to this podcast even
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are just remotely interested about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the best source of comication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said comedy and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can write like that if I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your creative writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this listener could only help with
the progression of cannabis as much as we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, he would be a happy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I think you need to take a
tour to the UK and spread your love around
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of your help from Just
Baz.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Just Baz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the love and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help us out on Patreon also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great review from our friends
in Great Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, yo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far so good, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this next one I believe comes
from our friends in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us five out of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from Presley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presley Boo from Apple Podcasts in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was left on August 6th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, That is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the top tier sound quality and
they like the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go on to say they've been listening
to all the grow lessons and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap it up with, Gang, gang,
gang, gang, buzz, buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it that people appreciate the
top tier sound quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I put a little effort into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an audio kind of a guy before I
really got into the podcast thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad people notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad they like the top tier
information and those grow lessons took a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad they found those helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big shout out for the gang,
gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know my friends are listening
to the same podcast that I'm listening to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this next review comes from our
friends up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says Rasta Jeff, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us five stars and it says Rasta
Jeff is the most effective cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation educator around these parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the effort we're putting in is
doing the most work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a comment on you or a comment on
those parts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Around those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm the only, if I'm the only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't let Jeff's ego just go out of
control, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every now and then we got to give it a
little poke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm the only one around those parts,
which still damn means I'm the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they said the Willie Nelson Snoop
Dogg over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's another huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started this podcast on a two to three
hour commute to a job I hated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast inspired me to become a novice
home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got them growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says I have perfected my craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have entered the Canadian cannabis
industry and worked my way from the
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmer room into the room to a grow lead
manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of those coworkers did you
introduce to the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went from listening to the show,
being inspired, thinking, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then became a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfected the craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we all want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got good enough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out of the rat race and into something
we'd like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entered the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went from the trim room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about the first step is go
trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your foot in the trim room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went from the trim room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are lead, grow lead manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they say, much respect,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, win these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's more to this
review that this application cut off,
[SPEAKER_00]: but dude, that is a great review even
without the win these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's how it ends, then win these bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Win these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he says much respect, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big respect back at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from our friend, LoudMusic2014 at
Apple Podcasts in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends from
Canada, our big friends up North.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are having a great grow
season up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everything's going well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're staying ire.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, I'm going to scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of more reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: This website keeps refreshing itself
because there's an ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard for me to keep track of my
place on this page, but we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology shall not defeat me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like you doubt me, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just looked at me like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might get you, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just also looks like you're playing tic
tac toe with yourself on your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making sure to cross out the ones
we do so that I don't read them all over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause nobody wants to hear these twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we'll get to another review in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says Wales UK and they gave us five
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are called Zootopian and they're
listening on Apple Podcasts from Great
[SPEAKER_00]: Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently they're from Wales UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, let's hear about outdoor gorilla
grow auto flower tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fail at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a decent outdoor grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit, but auto flower is
not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know much about auto flowers and
anything I did, I would have to just fake
[SPEAKER_00]: it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wouldn't be a quality podcast in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do a little, a show on like
gorilla growing general tips or,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, how shit used to be back here in the
struggle blood days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Struggle blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard that word in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first heard of auto flowers,
that was the first thing, first place my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain went was like, those would be
perfect for a struggle bud crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, struggle bud was a term for,
uh, planting seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of in the wilderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a location that was likely to produce
some sort of growth without any
[SPEAKER_01]: intervention from you, from the,
uh, the state, like when you put the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ground until you come back six
months later and rip it out of the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: and run away real quick in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was struggle bud growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the people I knew with home grows
outside had some struggle bud going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking looked like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where were we Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we start reading this review yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we knocked out the, the, the auto
flower review and now we're onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw me cross that one off the list and
see me go for the next one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to be the last one for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Mike and I are going to press pause
and take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to read a couple of
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say 50 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call themselves long time listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're listening on Apple podcasts from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to all of our
friends up North.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we have a nice Canadian
listenership.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a nice Canadian grow industry
up there, a nice cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all of our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stop wasting episodes by reading
iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to hear reviews, I'd read them
aloud to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do more episodes with your strain
info, answering emails, grow tips and
[SPEAKER_00]: white Mike with other potential guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to each and every episode,
but the ones when you read reviews feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like a waste of my time and yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the fact that you read the
reviews and please take this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: constructive critique and not a dig five
out of five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for most episodes, zero out of five
for the ones when you use most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode up by reading reviews,
keep up the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I appreciate the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my voice did a weird thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like to edit that going to keep
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what really helps a podcast to get
exposure is when somebody leaves a review
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps us get noticed on the front
page of iTunes, that makes you more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular in their algorithm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I request that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I request reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asking people to do that as a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a return to that favor, I read their
reviews on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm not maybe not your favorite
grow person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm not any sort of important person
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that every time Joey Diaz says my
name on the podcast, I know that every
[SPEAKER_00]: time the dude grows crew says my name on
the podcast, I still feel a little smile
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a little goofy in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, ah, they're talking about me on
my favorite podcast right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I read, read people's reviews and
I'm reading their shit, they feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done them a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done me a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a communal effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I read the reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, I will read your review on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to hear me say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's a great thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an exchange that we both get
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that you find it to be a
waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a little skip button on your
iPad, on your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 15 or 30 seconds forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mash on that a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do make some G this word we're brought
to you by on it and not really,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, manscape.com don't cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut your dick off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucko.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, just use that 15 second skip
forward button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get right through the reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want you to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate your constructive
criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take it as a dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're not going to hurt my feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, somebody has to not like my voice
keeps doing weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to edit, but we're not going to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, somebody has to not like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're not going to make everybody
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and he said 50 50, he likes the grow
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably has already checked out of
this and doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even read his review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got this far, send me an update,
send me an email grow from your heart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com and be like, I listened,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to know if you made it through
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about to stop with the listener
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for the listener
reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really, really appreciate every single
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the ones that are negative or focused
on something that the reviewer would like
[SPEAKER_01]: us to do different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every review is helpful and appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may take some of the constructive
criticism and I may use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm pretty set at the way that this
show goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look how many notes we've got feel like
four notes here for this whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just turn on a mic and we could
start talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to change a lot,
but if something really pisses somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: off or something, we would consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I will listen to opinions,
but this is the way the show's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good at this by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a nice little rhythm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're both real comfortable with
it and enjoy doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've found a fan base that
enjoys listening to us do it so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and if you, you don't agree with
that, please hit me up on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at new 15 or a public for sensible
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as on Facebook hit up,
Mike, I was going to say when you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room and like one person says,
Hey, you're an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one person may have had a bad
experience with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people go, you're an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be that other person's friend,
but if three or four people start going,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're an asshole, you're probably the
asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, like one out of every 50 reviews
say we suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, we're not an asshole yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not succeeding unless somebody's
hating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Michael Franti said, uh, if I don't
have any enemies, I'm not doing my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life might throw me a curve, but I'll
never be throwing a lob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mike Franti.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I said we're going to take a dab and
then we're going to read some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to do that Pavlov shit
and make you drool over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's press pause for a moment and let's
take a dad because they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to you choke while we dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a couple of quick
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously my voice sounds like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back in just a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the magic of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should speak for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicated at least we're working on the
second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're doing well over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked some Gigi for ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says 59 point something percent
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I got concentrates on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 66.4% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got stoner than 66%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stoner a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just said it like it fucking is
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we took a little dab break,
we said that we were going to read some
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to send me a grow question
or something like that, my email address
[SPEAKER_00]: is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that I'd like to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I says good day from down under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for the good email mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, I'll try to keep
it short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he said, that's what she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what she said?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, that's not what she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's what she said,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I came across your
podcast about a month or so ago by the way
[SPEAKER_00]: of episode 138, breeding and harvesting
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hooked after hearing how informative
and in depth you were and explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and feminization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freebies get them hooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm glad you're listening to the
breeding episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then he says, I started listening to
all of your grow lessons, which have
[SPEAKER_00]: really brought together everything else
that I've read through my research about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and made it simple and easy to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me because that is
kind of my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it simple for everybody to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: People learn with different brain types.
[SPEAKER_00]: People learn by looking, by hearing,
by doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are just hands on learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to make it easy for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even those hands on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Mike sees me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like looking telepathically up into
the sky and I'm putting my hands in shapes
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I can do those things while I'm
thinking about it so I can explain it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you as thoroughly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that somebody is learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're appreciating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is still more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I have some bubble gum,
some AK 47, some purple haze and white
[SPEAKER_00]: widow seeds and was wondering what your
opinions are on these varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if any of them would make good or
decent hybrids, they sign it with thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: from big T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they say you and white Mike should
come to Australia as consultants to our
[SPEAKER_00]: government on legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go there because everything
there is trying to fucking kill me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just 90% of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the rest of the city stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go out of that little line,
we're going to get murdered by some crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia's got a reputation for having
some crazy fucking wildlife out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go grow some Australian cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a passport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that may be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we start?
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to know if he's got bubble gum,
AK-47, purple haze and white widow seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's wondering my opinions on these
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if any of them would make good or
decent hybrids, I can't see your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see your list of strains which you
have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can hope that those are truly the
genetics that that seed package claims
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the bubble gum came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the AK-47 came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the purple haze or the
white widow seeds came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew who originally bred those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes me nervous about those,
that strain list is it sounds oddly
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar from our kind of distant past.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was, I thought the same,
but also they're in Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they may culture takes a little time to
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're still in their time capsule
is still there with those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to let that slide and not
judge too harshly on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, that is like, that's like having
a bunch of Mickey McDonnell rookie cards
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some pretty good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's real, you've got some great
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to question or doubt the
legitimacy of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who bred most of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who I would like to see on the
packaging for most of those, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without seeing the packaging,
without seeing the seeds, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: what those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I can't see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see your phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you've got to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of how unpalatable I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had paper, I could look at the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that white widow is great to breed
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I would like to breed with the
white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown bubblegum and AK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably think of some creative
ways to breed around there, some cubes,
[SPEAKER_00]: some triangles, some open pollinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could think of great things to do,
but without seeing the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what would work best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to see each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, I think as a breeder,
I'm kind of like a plant matchmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to find two plants that I've got
to look at them and grow them and touch
[SPEAKER_00]: them and smell them and experience them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picking from a list like this is sort of
like trying to pick two people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hit it off from names in a phone
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to make that analogy pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to be like, so do you think
Bill and Karen will get along?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know anything about Bill or
Karen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two white people probably,
Bill and Karen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no input on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how these are going to
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that I had more input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do choose to breed with them,
I would pick one or two packs of seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get those started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would select a couple of males,
a couple of females that really stand out
[SPEAKER_00]: for whatever reasons you believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the breeder now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would work projects as desired
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Mike said a second ago, it sounds like
you've got four different packs of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've definitely got enough stuff to
start a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is that you have to do it by
looking at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These all look good on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until you see them in front of you,
it's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look good on paper, but you don't
know which males are going to look good,
[SPEAKER_00]: which females are going to look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have something to do some sort of a
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pop two packs of seeds,
if you pop three packs of seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a solid male out of there that looks
like it'll work perfectly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then find a girl from all three packs
of seeds so that you've got maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum female, an AK-47 female,
and a white widow female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then perhaps a white widow male,
and pollinate all three of the girls with
[SPEAKER_00]: the one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make white widow F2s, and then you
can make white bubblegum, and you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: AK bubblegum 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or AK white widow 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can do a little bit of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to grow all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a lot of seeds to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's probably the way that I would
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be a matchmaker without knowing
some personalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to make some feminized
stuff, then you've just got to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: solid female, and then reverse it,
and then pollinate the same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: a different clone of the same cultivar,
and you can make your feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had better input for you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without seeing the plants, I really don't
know what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: On paper, I know what would look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I like the white widow as a
male, just because there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: traits I would stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I wouldn't breed with the
purple haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to put a lot of extended
time, flowering time into everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure Australia's got a long
summer growth season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the purple haze could also be this
person's favorite fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't get my attention at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a fan of a lot of hazes,
and watching them slowly disappear because
[SPEAKER_01]: they take more than nine weeks has been
hard for me to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the market has definitely changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this one comes from our friend Big
T.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to Big T for sending us a great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also say, PS, White Mike should
come down and be consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want us to go consult on
the grow or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want us to fix the gov. They want us
to go help them legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we've got to go do is go down
there and set up the podcast setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like we've got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to take a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to take some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be your ambassador of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got to go smoke down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're smoking, we need to be
interviewed by people so that they can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can medicate properly and we can
still produce and act like, what was it
[SPEAKER_00]: called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Responsible Productive Citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to call us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Responsible Productive Citizens is pretty
much exactly what I'd like to be called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like one of my old bosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw a handsome in there and I'm real
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make me edit this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, let's keep moving with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to the show
regularly, that was harder to say than it
[SPEAKER_00]: should have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you have been listening
regularly, you may remember that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: recent episode, we read an email from a
friend of ours who grew and smoked some
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey that he flowered for 11
weeks, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blew his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked for more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magic of the internet, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it was a trip to hear you and
Mike read and react to my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I read the reviews in the
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a trip to read your reaction to our
words, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trip to read your reaction to our
reaction, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I bought the pack of
lemon Jeffrey from Dank Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I only popped one seed because it
was all I had room for at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: so an old vendor that we don't work with.
Going old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to say an old vendor
that we're no longer working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are plenty of other good
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Seeds here now or the Hella Dank
Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he means the old Dank
Seed, so that is not Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do still do business with them,
support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it gets confusing, he says,
I wanted to make sure I had room to
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis, so he only had one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted room The plant filled up about a
two by three foot canopy, and he let a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of smaller nugs go full term to avoid
getting any really thick buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said airflow is never good enough for a
closet tent in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave his state out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to narrow down his location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got one lemon Jeffrey seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew it in a two by three area.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of smaller nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, even at 11 weeks, I wasn't seeing
much amber except at the very top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking I'd probably stalled or
slowed them along the way with a misstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there were more details on there
because I would assume that that is what
[SPEAKER_00]: messed them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A misstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something slowed them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that plant taking 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew more about what your
supposed or possible misstep was because I
[SPEAKER_00]: assume that's going to be what slowed them
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, whatever you did, it sounds like
you made some amazing mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I pressed rosin pretty
early after harvest and it had a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: darker look, leading me to believe that
the trikes were mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe he wasn't looking, didn't see
that they were actually amber,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the rosin did come out kind of dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you looking with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of loop are you looking with?
[SPEAKER_00]: How good your scope?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to clean your lens?
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't push her much at all,
meaning I didn't feed her a lot is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a nice organic amended soil and I
supplemented with one quarter strength
[SPEAKER_00]: organic bottled newts and some top
dressing and microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it taste really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't overfeed the lemon Jeffrey,
she comes out nice and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes on to say I did not keep a clone
of this one as I had to break off the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm back on it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet it feels great to be back growing
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always sucks to have to tear down the
grow for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes shit goes on, especially there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my wife and I polished off our
last lemon Jeffrey this morning and we
[SPEAKER_00]: will be on dispensary for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it's heartbreaking and expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find some quality dispensary
buds around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's rough to go from your personal
back to the store shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why'd you give me that look, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just life, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the next run of lemon Jeffrey will
be at least two plants so I can harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: one a little earlier and taste her as
intended by the breeder and another so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can revisit this late harvest again and
compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm curious if that misstep will show
in this next trial run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to stumble at the same spot
again in the same way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or don't and see if that 11 week flower is
really what that plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works twice, then it's not an
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something cool about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe it might've been that misstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know unless we try again and
don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to keep trying under
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like running experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thanks again, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks again, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are the shiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they signed it with no names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent way to sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially from the state they revealed
that they are from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No names for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the update on the lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing how the next
grow goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really look forward to photos of the
next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're down there in a dangerous
location, but if you can sneak a few shots
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you don't have to post them to social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an email account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can easily shoot them to the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's given me that sour face.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that mean, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just three bad jokes went through my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of making them, I just cringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to follow this little grow where
we dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the small setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fun to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you're producing out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to go big to have a blast
growing at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: One plant, two plants, popping one seed at
a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's absolutely nothing wrong with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your heart out one seed at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody made a joke today in another
podcast I participate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also on the Embracing Organics live
podcast on YouTube every Thursday at seven
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was on there and somebody said
something about, I know I'm just a
[SPEAKER_00]: basement grower, so excuse me,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, bro, not to interrupt
you, but I was like, I am a basement
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have a lot of commercial
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have been a lot of places through
and for growing, but like almost all of
[SPEAKER_00]: us, I started with a light in the basement
and I still remember those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still honor those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still appreciate and respect those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got as much love and respect for a
basement grower as I do a guy with 20
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, as I do for a guy with 50 to a
hundred to 500 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all doing the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we love growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love the effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that I think I'm hot shit
because I'm a commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing but love for the basement
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never forget your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a basement grower kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I talk about get out of the
basement mentality, get in the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow mindset if that's where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I still got a drum set in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played huge fucking places and I have
just as much fun and just as much passion
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm playing in the basement on
Thursday night before I have to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast after dinner, just killing an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the greatest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you're doing, if you do it
with your heart and you enjoy it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got mad respect for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't ever think that just because I've
gotten real far that I got any sort of I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not belittling any basement grower at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't got to go big to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have more of a struggle
than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say the name of our
vendors or anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can call people in another state or in
another county, a couple of miles north
[SPEAKER_00]: and go hang eat a pallet of this,
two pallets of this, five bottles of this
[SPEAKER_00]: and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it on a company credit card.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up with a semi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a forklift and pull a fucking
pallet of stuff out into a warehouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: high five the driver and sign for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that at your home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go in some places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a throwback earlier when
they're asking about gorilla growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those tips are the same for for
home growing somewhere where you ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be homegrown or where it's
brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was on an East Coast, if I was in an
East Coast state right as they were going
[SPEAKER_01]: legal, I'd still be just as nervous as I
was here when we were just going legal
[SPEAKER_01]: with growing at home and stuff because
it's still worth several thousand a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still your ass if the wrong
people hear about it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be careful, not because of
just the thieves, but because of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thieves, the law, the hassle,
the headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to drive one car to the grow
store, drive it to your friend's house,
[SPEAKER_00]: park in the garage, get all the shit out
of that car, put it in your car,
[SPEAKER_00]: drive your car to your house, to the
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unload.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while, my hustle was buying supplies
for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the thing I did for side money
was I would call up my growers I knew,
[SPEAKER_01]: get my shopping list for the day,
go fill their shopping lists, go home,
[SPEAKER_01]: repackage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later that day or the next day,
go deliver it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a major side hustle for a minute
when things were just starting to turn the
[SPEAKER_01]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are so different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, my point is no disrespect to
