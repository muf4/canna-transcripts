[SPEAKER_00]: Alright before I jump into the main topic
of today's podcast I do want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: something I saw today I was driving around
town and I saw a giant fire there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge fire and it made me want to come home
and remind you if you're growing maybe if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not growing maybe just in your home
definitely if you're growing do you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke detector some sort of fire detector
then if that goes off do you have a fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguisher sometimes a lot of us may be
running a lot of equipment just plugging
[SPEAKER_00]: in a grow light could set you up for
disaster if you're pulling too much power
[SPEAKER_00]: from the wall or if that grow light maybe
what's the word if it malfunctions if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: faulty is the word I'm looking for that
grow light can definitely cause major
[SPEAKER_00]: problems it can cause an electrical fire
it could cause a fire we need to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: as growers that we don't put that mark on
our community we've come a long way in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legalization and cannabis
acceptance we are not it's not crack
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore we are not treated like the devil
anymore we're given a lot of privileges
[SPEAKER_00]: now it is our responsibilities to make
sure excuse me it's our responsibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that we do not burn anything
down we've been given the rights to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in our homes many of us are growing
legally a lot of you may be growing
[SPEAKER_00]: illegally we need to be very careful to
not have a fire let's avoid a fire let's
[SPEAKER_00]: be logical and think about it when we're
setting up the grow one thing that often
[SPEAKER_00]: causes a fire is people trying to pull too
much electricity from one breaker or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even one breaker box think about all of
the power you're pulling if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: too many extension cords if you've got a
weak wiring that could definitely cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: fire think about that don't ever overload
an amp don't over overload a breaker is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm trying to say with too many amps
don't keep flipping that breaker if it
[SPEAKER_00]: flips a couple of times you've got a
problem you need to make some adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be that guy don't be that gal don't
be that grower that burnt down the house
[SPEAKER_00]: caused a huge fire on the entire block the
fire I saw today it was hours ago it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably still burning it's gonna take a
minute to get that bad motherfucker out
[SPEAKER_00]: but that fire was raging let's not cause
the fires now what I wanted to focus on is
[SPEAKER_00]: are you ready if there I don't want you to
have a fire but you might it could happen
[SPEAKER_00]: are you prepared do you have a strategy do
you have a smoke detector something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to indicate to you hey there is
smoke you need to do some shit do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a smoke detector in your house that will
beep and let you know do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: something connected to a device in your
grow that will let you know on your phone
[SPEAKER_00]: will it notify you will it beep maybe
you've got a heat sensor in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: will let you know hey it's way hot in here
and it'll let you it'll beep and let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's a fire in the grow room you
can see something's going on do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of notification something to
think about with that notification of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fire if you're growing in an illegal area
do you really want the cops and the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: department coming to your grow you may
need a strategy for getting out that fire
[SPEAKER_00]: so I highly recommend I recommend this for
any home if you've got a house where there
[SPEAKER_00]: are people if you're cooking if you've got
electricity go get a fire extinguisher a
[SPEAKER_00]: small fire extinguisher from a local
hardware store I hope you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: use it but I would rather you have that
fire extinguisher sitting on the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on the cupboard sitting on the
counter it only takes up a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: space put it on top of the fridge make
sure everybody knows it's there but I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: rather you have that and not need it then
need it and not have it that couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks that you spend could save your life
your home your family it could save all
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff it it's probably gonna ruin
your crop in your garden but I'd rather
[SPEAKER_00]: spray down the entire grow space with some
of that disgusting fire extinguisher shit
[SPEAKER_00]: then burn down the entire building
structure facility that the grow is in
[SPEAKER_00]: that would make a big difference to me so
do you have some sort of warning first of
[SPEAKER_00]: all I guess make sure you're not
overloading any breakers any circuits is
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your stuff safe is all of your
stuff current you have a bunch of old
[SPEAKER_00]: ballast that make a bunch of weird noises
when you turn them on does it go and sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's gonna catch on fire guess what
it's gonna are all of your blowers
[SPEAKER_00]: connected properly is there anything in
any of the fans or is all the wiring good
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people do some uh some
real ingenuitive wiring to make shit work
[SPEAKER_00]: be very careful let's not burn anything
down that's the first thing to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: is not cause any fires then if you do do
you have something to notify you then
[SPEAKER_00]: think about the interaction with law
enforcement and the fire department is it
[SPEAKER_00]: okay to have that grill where you have it
do you have a way to get that fire out
[SPEAKER_00]: before they get there do you have a
strategy do you have an excuse do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend that you can call to help you out
do you have something in place then once
[SPEAKER_00]: that alarm goes off you have a way to put
out that fire they sell not a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation stores the hydroponic stores
the grow stores a lot of the places sell a
[SPEAKER_00]: flame defender I nobody pays me any money
to say anything about these products they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell a flame defender fire extinguisher
that hangs from the ceiling of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space and if that grow space reaches a
certain temperature that thing will
[SPEAKER_00]: rupture and fire retardant powder will
explode all over your grow space it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: in a 360 degree pattern it will spray and
throw this disgusting dust all over it
[SPEAKER_00]: will put out the fire but it will ruin
everything in that room all of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: gear will need a thorough cleaning all of
your plants are pretty much fucked at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point but it will rescue a fire so I'd
recommend checking out the flame defender
[SPEAKER_00]: again they don't pay me to advertise I'm
just I want you guys to be safe I the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is grow from your heart I care
about people I care about you guys I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: something today I thought maybe I could
give you a hint and help you out so they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't pay me to say this flame defender
looks like a good product it is a I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it's called I forgot to Google
and research it's what I remember it will
[SPEAKER_00]: put out a fire in case of a fire and you
don't even have to be there it will just
[SPEAKER_00]: explode rupture put out the powder and
extinguish that fire for you or you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the option to have a fire extinguisher and
if you do buy a fire fire extinguisher and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a good idea to pull the pin and give
it a spray one time just see what that's
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe practice it's always when you
get a new job at a big facility I've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten jobs at like warehouses and
factories and places where there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: fires oftentimes I'm kind of a bigger dude
and I'm ready willing and able I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking I'm strong-minded I'm kind of
bossy I can follow instructions I'm one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys who gets trained on how to use
the fire extinguisher all the time because
[SPEAKER_00]: they know that I can handle an emergency
situation that's just my mindset so I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been trained on using the fire
extinguisher they do it in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: and commercial grows they do it and what
am I saying industrial jobs they do in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial jobs so why not train yourself
on it get ready be prepared to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: fire extinguisher I don't want you to have
to use it I really don't I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: there to be a fire I don't want you to
have to spray anything but I'd rather you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the fire extinguisher and know how to
use it instead of freak out and run down
[SPEAKER_00]: the street when the fire is happening and
end up making things even worse so I saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: fire today you guys it made me want to
remind you to think about safety and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that's something that often gets over
and looks we don't think about it
[SPEAKER_00]: something I don't talk about enough
probably being an advocate a teacher an
[SPEAKER_00]: educator whatever you want to call me here
in the cannabis space a podcaster I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it is part of my responsibility to remind
you not to be that grower don't burn the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit down don't burn it down until it's
dried and cured bro all right let's get
[SPEAKER_00]: off of this topic of seeing a fire that
was a huge fire get your shit together be
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for that that was a lot of smoke
that I saw today also I hope everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: safe yeah that's all I could say about
that let's game over there is an email
[SPEAKER_00]: here it says this one comes from our
friend Dio what up Dio it goes a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: this it says hey Rasta Jeff I'm somewhat
new to helping people out with the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow well thank you for helping even if
you're new you're helping and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: matters it says I have an older friend who
is trying cannabis to deal with intense
[SPEAKER_00]: nerve pain I hope that's helping it says
she has got fibromyalgia and spinal
[SPEAKER_00]: stenosis to name a couple of her condition
sounds like she may have a few more that
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't listen off I hope we find some
medicine that works well for your friend
[SPEAKER_00]: here big up and fist bump to you for
helping somebody it says her pain heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: affects what she can do especially with
her hands yes I definitely understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: it says I've given her some flowers to see
if it helps but consumption let's see but
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking consumption through smoking is
rough oh and when I say flowers maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't made this clear when I say flowers
I'm just kind of in the industry I'm an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry snob I guess when we say flowers
we mean but we mean weed the dried buds
[SPEAKER_00]: the parts you want to smoke the herbs the
buds the nugs that's that's flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: then if you talk about concentrates we
just say concentrates so you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers concentrates edibles and then you
can actually get clones and plants those
[SPEAKER_00]: are the things that are available so when
I'm saying flowers I'm talking about dried
[SPEAKER_00]: and cured buds that are smokable that's
what our friend here is referring to as
[SPEAKER_00]: well so our friend is given our his we're
gonna call this person your patient you've
[SPEAKER_00]: given your patient some herb and she's got
fibromyalgia and spinal stenosis and her
[SPEAKER_00]: hands are limited she can't do things with
her hands and smoking the flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult she can't roll joints with her
hand pain and it seems it's even makes for
[SPEAKER_00]: properly holding the pipe difficult so
that's got to be rough she can't hold the
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe and light it with a lighter properly
because her hands are losing strength and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting sore says I brought up some fancy
flower vaporizer vaporizers that might
[SPEAKER_00]: ease the process but the price point for
something decent is a bit high yes
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately the price point is quite
high for getting yourself into one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those electric smoking devices you have to
be careful because you don't want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: the polyurethane stuff and the wire
coating and you want to get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: products you don't smoke a bunch of
bullshit but um they are quite expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: it says I plan on letting her try my
volcano my next trip to visit I've also
[SPEAKER_00]: brought her some homemade can of salve
with other medicinal herbs in it she's a
[SPEAKER_00]: light user at best so concentrates are out
of the question for now all right so it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like our friend is gonna ask how he
can more easily medicate our new patient
[SPEAKER_00]: here it sounds like the condition is
making it tough they can't smoke because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't hold the pipe properly they
can't roll joints man you're they are very
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky to have a friend like you that is
something that is very beneficial to this
[SPEAKER_00]: person not only are they going to get
medicated through cannabis they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get some relief that way once we get them
dialed in with their dosage and the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and all the stuff that they need
but also a huge part of medicating with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in my opinion in my experience in
my belief is the social aspect we feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better when we are with people that we
enjoy being with it just feels good right
[SPEAKER_00]: what's like being here right here by me by
myself this is cool but if you put Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: right there or Clint right there the
party's gonna be way better it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: two of us so be twice the vibes twice the
energy you could even put somebody I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know right there and as long as they're
not a fucking psycho and even if they are
[SPEAKER_00]: a psychopath I could still probably have a
good time with them it's gonna get better
[SPEAKER_00]: almost everything you do is better with
people and if you had a couple more people
[SPEAKER_00]: and a couple more people that's why
festivals are so cool the vibe just gets
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger we all spread the energy it feels
good to be social I think that smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: with this person and being a good friend
to this person and being we call this a
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver situation is what this used to
be in Colorado you are this person's
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver you've decided to take caregiver
responsibilities as a cannabis caregiver
[SPEAKER_00]: to this person that is a huge part the
social aspect and hanging out smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: caring for this person is a huge part of
the medicinal aspect of cannabis when you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke at least for me if you've ever been
around me in person I'll take a big dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and set down the dab rig and blow up the
smoke and just start fucking talking I
[SPEAKER_00]: love being social and hanging out and
being around people after I smoke and this
[SPEAKER_00]: person they're in pain they're hurting
they're not feeling good and so as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: they smoke they're gonna feel better
they're gonna want to chit chat and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be there and you're gonna fire their
conversation up and give them ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna help them mainly forget that
they're in pain forget that they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that's that's what our friends do
for us we've all got bills to pay and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: on our mind and things to worry about but
when you got friends and you smoke a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of that shit goes out of your mind for a
minute you can't escape it you can't run
[SPEAKER_00]: from it it's got to be dealt with but it's
good for you to get away get some giggles
[SPEAKER_00]: get some laughter get some social
interaction so your friend is very lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: to have you very blessed to have a
caregiver like you that is concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to reach out to me to find better
ways to help I am rambling here you said
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to let her try the volcano
on the next trip I really think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be the best ways I'm like
oh this feels good to oh shit this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: a good time I never want to do this we
definitely don't want to scare your friend
[SPEAKER_00]: away from cannabis we want to ease her
into cannabis as medicine and that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: you do any other medicine you would ease
in you wouldn't jump in with the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: heroic dose of anything so be careful ease
her in slowly with the doses it says
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another option in tinctures but I
don't have the knowledge or equipment to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it and it's expensive locally might
not be her first choice is there any way
[SPEAKER_00]: of consuming dry flour that is a bit more
accessible with limited use of the hands
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how the butter works for her
it might be the best fit thanks in advance
[SPEAKER_00]: then he wraps it up here with a lot of
great stuff Dio thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: message big up on you for helping this
patient this client of yours I really
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the edibles would be a great
way to go she's going to get longer relief
[SPEAKER_00]: better acting relief more effective relief
that it's gonna get inside the body and
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there deeper I feel like edibles
when you eat it and knows where to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I'm gonna go right there and
make your pain go away and the edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: will work also smoking isn't really
healthy it sounds like your friends got
[SPEAKER_00]: enough health concerns and enough problems
already smoking isn't really I I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a hypocrite here because I take gigantic
dabs all day but if this person isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: already smoking and doesn't have the habit
and the comfort of it maybe edibles would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the way to go let's just save their
lungs and keep them healthy they have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough enough health concerns we don't
need to introduce lung problems and a
[SPEAKER_00]: cough into this scenario here so let's
give them edibles and see how that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: also I do
[SPEAKER_00]: really think that the volcano is going to
be being a great caregiver a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: advice that I would recommend is if you do
go the edible route maybe give her the
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles when you can be there for the next
at least two to four maybe six hours you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to hang out or at least be able
to stay for a few hours and she see if she
[SPEAKER_00]: freaks the heck out or just be able to pop
in occasionally and make sure she doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: need anything if you can't stick around
for the whole duration of the time make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you could stay until it kicks in make
sure she's comfortable then go handle your
[SPEAKER_00]: business then come back maybe every hour
maybe every hour and a half or two hours
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure she doesn't need anything
sometimes around hour four maybe hour six
[SPEAKER_00]: those edibles will change gears on you and
she'll just be stuck in a corner wishing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'd bring her a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich and a Dr. Pepper or
[SPEAKER_00]: something maybe that's all she needs to
save her life at that point but I do
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend going the edible route I also
highly recommend you hang out while you
[SPEAKER_00]: give her the edibles stick around make
sure she's safe make sure she's
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable get some good snacks available
some healthy snacks get some good
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation in your mind prepared maybe
have some good Netflix prepared do a
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly Netflix chill and edibles session
see how that goes one ironic thing it's
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible that I think this route but one
thing I think is ironic in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry we sell all these products to
people to make them feel better and then
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most frustrating things is that
we put all these products in childproof
[SPEAKER_00]: containers and the people with hand
problems can't even open them so I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the struggle sometimes I've got
good hands and sometimes I can't even get
[SPEAKER_00]: the products open so I understand how
frustrating it could be my dude Dio you're
[SPEAKER_00]: a great person for helping out your
friends I really hope that the edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: work I really hope you can find a way to
dose the edibles properly if you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: some lab tested edibles that would be
ideal but I understand we've all got to
[SPEAKER_00]: work within our means and with our budget
I don't even know if you're in a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: place but I think edibles would be the way
to go definitely oh I was gonna recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: also another vaporizer you said the
volcano I have experience with the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: brothers vaporizer it's a small it looks
like a wooden box with the whip the tube
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of it that you hit that's real
easy for someone to manage even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have minimal hand abilities all you have
to do is grind up the herb that may you
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you could go pre grind up a bunch of
herb for give her like an eighth or a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter of ground up herb that's ready to
go then all she's got to do is fill the
[SPEAKER_00]: whip you know what I mean like if if you
guys have used a vaporizer you know which
[SPEAKER_00]: part the whip is you just got to fill the
whip and get it up onto the heating
[SPEAKER_00]: element and then let it heat all she's got
to do at that point is grab the other end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the whip and inhale and smoke the vape
and you don't it won't even if you set it
[SPEAKER_00]: the right temp the herb doesn't burn until
you're it doesn't vaporize until you draw
[SPEAKER_00]: through it because you have to move the
heat over the over the herb it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly heating so the vapor brothers
device is another option that I may
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend check out vapor brothers good
product again those guys don't pay me at
[SPEAKER_00]: all it's a good product I used to have one
I used it it was great also the Buddha is
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar the Buddha and the silver
surfer they're all the vapor brothers the
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddha the silver surfer in my opinion
they're all going to be similar quality
[SPEAKER_00]: for their price point they're all going to
be great for what they cost they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for their price point again
nobody pays me I'm just talking out of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and things that I have used my
other advice eventually you said that
[SPEAKER_00]: she's a new smoker and dabs would probably
wreck her eventually she's gonna want to
[SPEAKER_00]: move up to dabs because concentrates are
more cost-effective in my opinion and at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point that's when I would go with the
puffco the puffco would be super easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: this person however right now I think the
vapor bros the volcano or some good
[SPEAKER_00]: old-fashioned edibles are the way to go my
dude Dio thank you for the great message I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope we were able to help your friend out
big on you big up to you for helping out
[SPEAKER_00]: people and taking it upon yourself to be
that kind of a friend the world needs more
[SPEAKER_00]: people like you go smoke a joint with your
friend Tom Rasta Jeff said what's up all
[SPEAKER_00]: right this message came from my friend ye
motherfucking ha shout out to my buddy ye
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucking ha great dude good grower
all the other stuff is questionable this
[SPEAKER_00]: message says just in case you read this on
the podcast big salute to the iry army big
[SPEAKER_00]: salute brother thank you for being a part
of the iry army thank you for letting me
[SPEAKER_00]: pick on you always a good time it says I
have a question about small scale pheno
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting that is a very good question it
says if the goal is to sift through as
[SPEAKER_00]: many new plants as possible while
identifying the keepers and winners do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think it would be better to clone
everything before I flip or revege plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that show themselves to be the most worthy
once they have flowered that is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good question I've got a very good answer
for that however there is more to the
[SPEAKER_00]: message it says typically I try and make
it my practice to always take at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of every every plant before I flip
it to flower however that is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and a small space to hang on to
while determining if I need to run them
[SPEAKER_00]: again yes that is completely
understandable I totally get it being a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder doing some being somebody that
does a lot of pheno hunts this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my struggles especially since Colorado has
got me limited down to so few plants to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a pheno hunt I definitely cutting clones
you just doubled your numbers immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: so I understand the struggle here it goes
on though there's more it says it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of clones returning okay recently I
recently had a round of clones fail and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have one plant that I'm thinking I will
have to revege because I want to take her
[SPEAKER_00]: out on some more dates I love the way you
think about that as I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this I realized that reveging those that
stand out only might make might take a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer but would lessen the amount of
clones that I care for and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: could save me space it sounds like you're
on the right track bro it sounds like you
[SPEAKER_00]: were on a good path one thing I'm gonna
jump in I'm gonna interrupt myself here
[SPEAKER_00]: the reveging process might take a little
bit longer do you do the 18 six method
[SPEAKER_00]: that I talked about at the end of flower
when you begin flushing flip those lights
[SPEAKER_00]: to 18 six then the plants will speed up a
little bit more quickly that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: already going back to revege of course
this is hard to do because you're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno hunt so maybe you haven't ran these
plants before but when you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna harvest in a couple days you could
flip them early you could turn them back
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter if it's 14 days 10 7 5
any days ahead are days ahead so that will
[SPEAKER_00]: get you sped up on the revege process
that'll get you going there's more to it
[SPEAKER_00]: it says I also like the idea of not
growing out a bunch of clones just to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: them that is a very very great point if
they're not what I'm looking for or
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out something okay just cuz I had
a clone oh that's another good thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't think about sometimes you might
just grow that plant just because the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone exists you didn't even need it not a
quality plant never thought of that route
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good way to give yourself some
discipline he wraps it up by saying I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: that both cloning and revege arguments
have their merits and I'm curious to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts on the topic what strategy
would you use if you were hunting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: basement with a few tents big love and
respect from your dude ye motherfucking ha
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you bro this is a great question I
understand I understand the struggle
[SPEAKER_00]: completely I definitely do because I like
to do a lot of pheno hunts myself and like
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier if I pop a pack of seeds
I'm allowed 12 plants if I pop 10 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already really close to the limit if I
cut clones of all of those I'm definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: in the illegal zone by the time those
clones root I am in an illegal time frame
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing you could do is you could cut
those clones a little bit later you can
[SPEAKER_00]: cut them right as the plant goes into
flower then cut the clones that'll save
[SPEAKER_00]: you a couple of weeks but that's not the
way that I'm gonna recommend I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the right idea the way that you
are thinking about reveging I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: think you've got the right strategy the
idea is to grow a pack of seeds and find
[SPEAKER_00]: the best one out of there right and people
talk about growing a bunch of seeds I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you should find I think if you buy a
10 pack of my seeds you'll probably find
[SPEAKER_00]: the keeper in the 10 pack there'll be one
maybe two gems in there that really stand
[SPEAKER_00]: out you shouldn't have to buy too many
packs but so the idea is to run the 10
[SPEAKER_00]: pack and find the gem in there I do agree
that the revege since we're so limited on
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers I agree completely that the revege
is a great strategy for doing this so I
[SPEAKER_00]: would run my 10 and then I would early on
I'm gonna eliminate a bunch of boys so now
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just cut out a bunch of boys I
probably got five left I'm gonna keep an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye on them you're already gonna know that
that one over there is too stretchy or
[SPEAKER_00]: just too short or too shitty already know
that number five is gone now you're down
[SPEAKER_00]: to four so now you've only got four left
definitely I would revege the best two at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end and we'll talk about revege real
quick I would cut off harvest almost
[SPEAKER_00]: everything except like somewhere between
two and five little buds on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: just thumb sized buds my thumbs aren't
super big thumb sized nuggets and leave
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage you need leaves you can't just
revege sticks you need some foliage on
[SPEAKER_00]: there a bud with a couple of leaves on it
is ideal somewhere between two and five
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb sized nuggets is all you need if
your plant is root bound I would repot it
[SPEAKER_00]: to a bigger pot at this time that will
encourage the the reveging process so
[SPEAKER_00]: you've cut everything down you've left a
couple of buds at the very bottom two to
[SPEAKER_00]: five buds the size of my thumb put that
plant under a at least 18 hours of light
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 18-6 maybe 19-5 if you want to get
crazy put it under 24 hours of light I
[SPEAKER_00]: really think some sleeping time does
everything nicely they really enjoy the
[SPEAKER_00]: sleepy time you love a nap the plants love
a nap your equipment will appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: nap your electricity bill will enjoy the
nap as well so maybe put them under like
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 hours of light five hours of darkness
if you want to do 24 if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: super intense light do the 24 if you got a
good light you can adjust that so I would
[SPEAKER_00]: cut down almost everything except the
bottom five ish nuggets up pot it or do
[SPEAKER_00]: some root pruning if you're experienced in
that then put it under 18-19 maybe 20
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of light depending on the quality of
light which you're able to give it then
[SPEAKER_00]: start feeding it a vegetative nutrient mix
give it a high nitrogen diet then just
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it as normal water it as normal and
then just wait eventually that plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: start to spit out new growth shoots
sometimes they'll come out looking crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be twisty and spindly and they'll
look like they've got problems that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you expect from a revege give that a
little bit of time it will begin to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: into normal leaves you'll see eventually
it'll make one day it'll just make a long
[SPEAKER_00]: normal shoot with beautiful leaves coming
out of the top you'd be like oh that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal weed plant again what I recommend
is to clone that new part you've got that
[SPEAKER_00]: new fresh growth clone that part make that
the mother plant grow that part out then
[SPEAKER_00]: cut clones from that so it takes a little
bit to get there but that is the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend it revege it cut a clone vege
out the clone then cut clones from that
[SPEAKER_00]: one so that you've got fresh plants to
work with so I think your strategy is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good idea that way you don't have
to wait for those clones to root you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to try to keep them alive you don't
have to waste space you don't have to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones that takes a whole that's a
little bit of time right there just
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how many plants you've got
you want to get two or three maybe five
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts of everything that's gonna take you a
couple hours maybe an hour right there
[SPEAKER_00]: just to fill the clone dome so save
yourself some time don't cut the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't need don't stress on
keeping them alive don't double up your
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers focus on finding that plant that
is perfect for you we talk about phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: selection a lot find that one that is
perfect for you find the two that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect for you select those keep them get
them in revege get them cloned again then
[SPEAKER_00]: what I recommend is have your favorite one
or two have a keeper plant of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're gonna do it again we're gonna
use your favorite two and we're gonna vege
[SPEAKER_00]: those up but at the same time we're gonna
run another pack of seeds so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: compare another pack of seeds to the two
keepers the one keeper we've already
[SPEAKER_00]: selected and keep doing phenohunts to find
the best plants until you've got a room
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with the best plants right now
let's say that your legal limit is ten
[SPEAKER_00]: let's run ten seeds and find a keeper out
of that now you got one keeper out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: now let's run nine more seeds and fill all
ten spots and then find a keeper out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that one and now we've got eight spots
left let's pop eight more seeds until we
[SPEAKER_00]: fill that whole room with nothing but
badass keepers or at least the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers you desire or at least maybe one
marvelous plant that you just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrading all the time you're like this
one's better we're keeping that this one's
[SPEAKER_00]: better we're keeping that keep striving
hunting for that best one then cut a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of clones of that then fill all of those
tents with that bad bitch that you do find
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think you've got the right idea my
dude if you've got any follow-up questions
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that I would love to hear from
you everybody else out there if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: any questions corrections comments or

[SPEAKER_00]: positive feedback I will take all of that
also don't forget about the patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign at patreon.com forward slash grow
from your heart if I said all of that too
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly because sometimes I get talking
pretty fast check out my website at
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetics.com everything you need will
be at iregenetics.com there's a link to
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord server there's a link to seed
vendors there's a link to merchandise
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a grow help tab if you have a
grow question you can simply fill out the
[SPEAKER_00]: questionnaire on the grow help tab then
you type in your grow question hit send
[SPEAKER_00]: that will send it right to my email it
will vibrate in my pocket and I will print
[SPEAKER_00]: out the question I will answer your grow
question right here on the podcast that
[SPEAKER_00]: way I can get you a solid answer and if
you've got the question that probably
[SPEAKER_00]: means there are a lot of other growers out
there that need help with the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: help me help you send me your questions
either growfromyourheartathotmail.com or
