[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the cough in the throat
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I was trying not to cough the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame it on some friends that
are at the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to clear the throat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, joining me today for
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to The Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't been here for a long time,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where have you been?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been working like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And running around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was Vegas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegas was ... The look on your face,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Vegas is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas is always crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what happens in Vegas stays in
Vegas, but you can tell us what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The after party we threw in Vegas was just
crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Brett, Fresh,
Daily Bong, Taylor, Chris, Granny,
[SPEAKER_03]: and everyone else that was a part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every sponsor, every everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like a huge party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here to my left, also speaking of the
party in Vegas, the guy who worked the
[SPEAKER_00]: boom mic for the movie that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: The boom stick guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phrase Granny porn happened at my
table a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been a little extra after
our movie action going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dad and granny and our friend Brett
are now movie stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobo Blastico over here got to be the guy
that operated the boom mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having us again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since you guys have been
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been at the house chilling,
taking dabs, but we haven't put mics out
[SPEAKER_00]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been all weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why haven't we done this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just been friends, chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised you don't put ninja mics
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should just drop some mics from the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like one day I'm going to come in
and you're just going to hit enter on your
[SPEAKER_03]: computer and you're just going to have
some really incriminating stuff on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving me ideas that nobody in the
podcast world can see my face right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, shit, I'm just going to hang
mics from the chandelier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw you as the wrestling judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here as the ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just come right, yeah, really good
mics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need one that hangs against
everybody.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, coming up on future
episodes, incriminating shit from Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: and Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Brother podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, let's not do that to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened at that party that we could
talk about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually we, oh my God, I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who threw the party?
[SPEAKER_03]: Brett did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett from Mary's Motivation on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also known as Evo Labs Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Terp Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild and crazy kid Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edie D Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dance like a freak on Instagram,
Brett.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys see his dab slut video when
we came back from Vegas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I kind of can't handle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett, you're awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that I live 130 miles away from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get together more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a shitty excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get together one of these days and
take some dabs, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will make that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Brett will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab and Granny was at the event,
obviously because there was a Brett and
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not really a porn, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a spoof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm telling myself in my head it was
a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know what happened in
Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was definitely a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny part of recording that whole
thing was that we had a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_03]: keep coming into the house and stuff as we
were in the middle of recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between each shoot, we would get a shot
and be like, that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try this instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would do another shoot and
somebody would walk in.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we're setting up, we're like,
all right, quiet on set, quiet on set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd be like, what the fuck did we
just walk in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was the video crew that recorded
everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh did most of the recording out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The videos that I saw were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were all from Fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were great videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff on your Instagram,
on Brett's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all the professional videos were
done by Fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Earl Tycoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked like he was having a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ty was killing it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had brought all the slabs for
DabSketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the event that took you guys out
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I wasn't sure why everybody went.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, boycotting that crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said something that we got to rewind
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said DabSketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: DabSketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in Oklahoma and fucking Iowa are
going DabSketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck are these Colorado people
doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody has now created a banger where
there is a backboard on the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about banger on the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have and it's they've marketed as
DabSketball.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the glass mule is who was out there
with the DabSketball nails and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take this banger with the backboard
and I hit the banger and I throw my dab at
[SPEAKER_00]: it, just like I'm playing basketball.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has a bubble cap for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what if I miss?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to keep shooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does the dab go?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way we played it, we played on a
big table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We played it one versus one and we just
lined up like five dabs, six dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, so each side, each person got
three dabs and you just heat it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second they turn red, you give a 10
second cool down, you start throwing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trick is to throw it as fast as
you possibly can to make it the first
[SPEAKER_01]: shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other person has to take a hot and
hurty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think they waited 10 seconds,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they just started shooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just try to make it right away and
just hot and hurty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little half gram dab real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are throwing half gram dabs
across the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people in other places right now
that want to punch themselves in the
[SPEAKER_00]: forehead hearing that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw a half gram dab across the
table with the chance of missing and
[SPEAKER_00]: losing that half gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was literally like 30 kids around
this table and the second it fell,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were like, where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurry up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was just tossing that dab
right back on the dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab rescue unit, kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really made it off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can people see some video from the
Vegas party from your After Cannabis Gut
[SPEAKER_00]: party hosted by Brett, Mary's Motivation,
the wild and crazy kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one page right there, Mary's
Motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Mary's Motivation and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also follow Lindsey, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, you've got a lot of Instagram
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one should we follow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some party stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apparently see a picture of the
podcast happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw that happen on one of you guys'
phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the man who got most of
the footage, John L.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to John L.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love Fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and I have been talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some stuff in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about things.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of my favorites right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He makes me so happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just so sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may need a male voice for a cannabis
related project in the future and he has
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to me about being a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good voice and some recording
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsey, a couple of episodes ago,
you were here and Granny and I were giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep trolling you about this fucking
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't troll you anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't troll me anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys troll me so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went and made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, screw you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go home and play on my
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of what it was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's running and it looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's running.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is super successful and I guess I
should thank you and Granny for that
[SPEAKER_03]: because you guys trolled the fuck out of
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys can head over to the
travelingstoner.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an about me page.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a blog page.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sponsors are up there with different
links to their website and my discount
[SPEAKER_03]: codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The YouTube channel was supposed to be out
at the end of March, but I just got that
[SPEAKER_03]: really nice Nikon camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because I've been playing around with
it, I'd rather put out a YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm proud of than like rush something
out and just put something out that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like not happy with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm still playing around with the
camera and I'll say it on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle's moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daily Bong is moving out here after 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I have a feeling that having him
out here will help me a lot with my
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Daily Bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you have some sponsors and that
your sponsors are listed on your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be polite and kind of you to give
a shout out to like two or three of your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite sponsors right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vi Vaporizers is definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Empire of Wellness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely loving their CBD right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have turped up CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crumble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their gummies are about to hit the market,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some of them right here with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just happen to, if you want to try some
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will eat one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One five milligram CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some inflammation in a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Canister, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the grinders and the riot tool and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grind like an ounce of weed in
that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even make that size anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Chris's three and a half inch one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grind a whole bunch of herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting one of these out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the texture so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that it's coated in this little
crunchy sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be so delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said Vi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said these edible guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said the grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit of, I'm going to
throw this in my mouth and be a rude
[SPEAKER_00]: podcaster and just chew on this fucker
while we talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn Jeff, how could you?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going away quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you brought these Vi vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a hard guy to sell on a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how, we're going to talk more about
it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving my quick, and I've only
messed with it once or twice for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how easy to fill it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you can fill those little
canisters and have them kind of preloaded
[SPEAKER_00]: like shotgun shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just eject one and put the other
one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked how easy it was to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't clog up on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every handheld portable smoking device
I've ever used, I fucking ruined within
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three days because I overheat them
or they melt or I clog them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one seems like they have solved all
those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came with enough tools that if I do
fuck it up, I'm sure I can fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's exhaling or she's going to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you a chance since you
brought these to us and I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit or a lot,
if you want to, about these Vi handheld,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually mine's a limited edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you what it looks like
on my own and then I'll let Lindsay talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's kind of choking from a dab also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give her a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I like your descriptions anyway,
so go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sweet green metallic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what that's comparable
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the size of like- A battery pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: A battery pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the battery pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to use as compared to another
vaporizer, but I don't want to say their
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to that size,
but I'd like it better because I've used
[SPEAKER_00]: that one also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one's only good for a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, so it's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a green metallic color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the size of a little like an
iPhone portable charger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a limited edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's number 248 of 400 and it's got a
sweet Colorado logo on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this 400 total?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how many they're going to make
completely?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in that color and with the Colorado
logo on it, there will only be 400 made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got number 248 of this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a limited edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I got to have the Colorado
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And green, of course, with the Rastaman
that loves green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a button here with the little
V on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've told me how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little spot on the bottom where
you can unscrew it and you just load in
[SPEAKER_00]: preload.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not preloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You load them yourself, but you load in
cartridges that you can preload before you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to wherever you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to be wherever you are
trying to fill your containers because
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice, this is plastic on the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice plastic mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really hard to sell on a handheld
vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a vape?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Handheld vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hard to sell on it and I'm going to
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of places I have to go
soon where this is going to come in super
[SPEAKER_00]: handy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually sat on the focus group for the
last year and a half, like helping them to
[SPEAKER_03]: develop this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a year and a half ago, someone came to
me and said, would you like to sit on a
[SPEAKER_03]: focus group?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've gotten myself all tickled over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all choked up?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give her a dab, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help her out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll help me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a year and a half ago, someone came to
me and asked if I wanted to be on a focus
[SPEAKER_03]: group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they brought a product out that looked
exactly similar to this, but had different
[SPEAKER_03]: program software.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, well, what do you think
about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we sat on a focus group for three days
and we went back and forth and we gave our
[SPEAKER_03]: opinions on it and all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've actually gone through and
developed this with it because after we
[SPEAKER_03]: were all done with the vaporizers on day
three, Chris and I broke out the rigs and
[SPEAKER_03]: we started dabbing and we started showing
them how important concentrates are to
[SPEAKER_03]: this cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once they saw that, and I shouldn't
say they, once Barack, the inventor of
[SPEAKER_03]: this device, once Barack saw how
passionate we were about dabs and how
[SPEAKER_03]: important concentrates are to us,
he was like, oh, I need to go back and
[SPEAKER_03]: completely change this and redo it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went back and then he came back again
with a whole new product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's the same like shape and
everything, but it is completely like the
[SPEAKER_03]: inside is completely different the way it
cooks and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, to be honest with you,
I'm not a vaporizer person either really,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Barack is so passionate about this and
he stands behind this so much that you
[SPEAKER_03]: almost kind of, when you meet him,
you almost kind of like can't not get
[SPEAKER_03]: behind him.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kind of like, yeah, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you start to use it,
you see how great it is too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Barack's whole vision for this started
because he has a vaporizer making factory
[SPEAKER_03]: in China and he would have these people
come to him with different designs and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and he would sell it to them for one
price and then they would sell it to
[SPEAKER_03]: distributors and distributors sell it to
retailers and then us as the consumers pay
[SPEAKER_03]: 400 to 500% markup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his super affordable piece that he made
got marked up by, just like everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else in this industry, just like any
consumable product, it got marked up by
[SPEAKER_00]: every hand that touched it, every driver
that drove it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had an epiphany and he said,
what if I bring a great quality vaporizer
[SPEAKER_03]: that anybody can afford?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's his whole vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: His whole mission is to bring fairness
back to vaping.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, he just, he sees all
these other companies out there that are
[SPEAKER_03]: charging between like a hundred and $350
for a handheld vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's just, he, I mean, he calls it,
you know, for lack of a better word,
[SPEAKER_03]: like greed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just, it's what it is,
but yeah, so it's very, it's a very cool
[SPEAKER_03]: start to something and it's a really great
movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the vibe revolution is just that it's
bringing fairness back to, to the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these vaporizers will be available to
the, to be bought in store one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be at the 420 launch at positive
vibes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where 350 of the first 400 are
going to be, are going to be sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so positive vibes is going to be
the only time it's going to ever be quote
[SPEAKER_03]: unquote sold in a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that they're going to keep it
affordable to everybody is it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be sold through the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be sold on vibevaporizer
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you spell that for folks?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: V I E V A P O R I C E.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I just needed the vibe part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You looked fucking nervous when I said
spell that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only because you troll me so hard all the
time that I was like, damn, if I really
[SPEAKER_03]: mess up one word in this and you're like,
wrong answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you have a buzzer somewhere
ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I get, when I get a studio,
when I go Joe Rogan style and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: studio, there will be dropped down the
announcer mic, the Michael buffer mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be a buzzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be a trap door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just imagine if you're talking to that
microphone or you just started fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling and I just hit a button and he
fell right through the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ladies and gentlemen, back to the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act like nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in the gator pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Splash and she's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut you off in the middle of a beautiful
sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were doing such a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vi vaporizer.com is where they can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only going to be 300 available on
the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, three, there's 400, 350 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be three on the website,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's only going to be 350 available
in the store on launch day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do the math and I didn't
remember, but we got so far from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is the launch day?
[SPEAKER_03]: The launch day is four 20 at positive
five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean the stoner Christmas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is positive vibes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Positive vibes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to pull up the address
for you right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell everybody how and where so that they
can be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So positive vibes is at three,
three nine eight south Broadway in
[SPEAKER_03]: Inglewood, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And guys, the first 50 people that get to
this event, get a free vibe vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free F R double E y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second, excuse me, the second 50
people that get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get this vibe vaporizer for 50% off,
which is $25.
[SPEAKER_00]: A $25 vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause this w so the vaporizer only costs
$50 49.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those cartridges does it come
with?
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes with two flower ones and one wax
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said that those are reusable or
they're reusable or they're cheap enough
[SPEAKER_03]: that like if you wanted to, so the way
that the capsules were because you can
[SPEAKER_03]: prepack them before you go out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to go to concerts and stuff
like that, you can just take them and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can honestly let them hit the ground
because they're the, um, the stainless
[SPEAKER_03]: steel ones when they come out,
they're hot to the touch, obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's in an oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you can honestly just let them
hit the ground and walk away from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it won't even matter because they're
going to be so cheap to replace that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a spin shell casing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: See ya.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to, we talked, kept calling
them bullets and we're like, we got to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop calling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to change that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the right word for this
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to have a cactus cooler if you
would like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to, you're going to like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's more to also for,
for, for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shout out to the barefoot grower,
the barefoot extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff tastes good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be heartbroken when I run out
of this cactus cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have to grow more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Lindsay, where were we when we
rudely cut you off on this, this product
[SPEAKER_00]: description website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 50 people at the event,
get them for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd only have to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it cost to get into the event?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is you going to show up and have one of
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, 50 people go and make sure you
mentioned to somebody that you heard about
[SPEAKER_00]: it from the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that if I came here and got this
vaporizer, the grow from the heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: told me if I came here, I could get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even just running in the door and be
like, grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just shout it out the second you walk in
the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what everyone else who listens to
the podcast does when they meet someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, podcast, grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hey, you guys chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to run away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say, Hey, we're not going to run
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of, I said this on a recent
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it drives me crazy when I get messages
on Twitter and they're like, or Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, like, Hey bro, I saw you at
this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't know who you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we want to be your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to shake your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to dab you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to, we kind of want to take your
dad's on a suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like first a lot of times I want
to take your dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have tried to offer me dads or
I'm like, fuck, I got to dab that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you go super low temp and you
don't inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know what I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just being polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flipped the script.
[SPEAKER_00]: I offer them a dab of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, no, look at all the hash
I've got, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to try some of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I act like mine's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even it is because it's purged and
there's, if there's just looks,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it doesn't look purged or whatever,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just turned the vibe back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This got weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you just call me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a dab of this
cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a hot red.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should throw a wax capsule in there
for Jeff is yet to actually try the wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it with the flower that tastes
really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have one right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your little wax caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay's taking a dab in the middle of
her product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red means go in our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn this mic up real loud so we can
hear every wheeze that comes out of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that was just Jeff will pause the
podcast for a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for Lindsay dying from a hot dab
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pause it for Mike dying anymore
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't, don't feel special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be flattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Chris, I hear you got an event coming
up on four 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I does, I does with the new logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely dispensary I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: The chronic boutique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chronic boutique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that in Springs?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a medical facility only.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it is, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you nice to people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be nice to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try, I try to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk in and yell, grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please do actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it like you're mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I would make my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, grow from your heart.
Woo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smile and you'll grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you yell Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every count to 17 and you'll Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got to 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your head and you'll Terps all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what Chris is doing,
if he's trying to help you, if he's trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to check your ID, just, just bug this shit
out of him for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely want to come down April
15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we'll do it in a huge, uh,
grand opening for our downtown location
[SPEAKER_01]: off of East Pikes Peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a whole bunch of vendors and a
whole bunch of live, uh, entertainment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traveling stoner will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot, uh, commit to being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that I'll be at the dude gross
cup that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on how traffic and my
day goes, how my Friday goes to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yes, I will be at the dude gross
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to seeing you guys
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny, when you listen to this,
uh, contact somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it sounds like you may need
transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to figure all that out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got her already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was gonna, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to be with us at the chronic
boutique of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny's got a ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, when you hear this, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to figure out if you're going,
you've got a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we just got to figure out if you're
going or not and how you're getting there
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, text me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, we got to get you out of the house,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be, it'd be fun to take you to a
cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get you high out of your mind and take
you home.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a random text message
from Mike that says, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, why is Mike texting me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Lindsay said on the podcast,
Mike, text me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he, he's a night owl and he listens
to shit when his kid goes to bed.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will text you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can text us at three in the morning if
that's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't heard from me in a minute,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, he did make it back from
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did talk a little while ago about Mike
going to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the last time I saw him was
sitting at this table and he went to
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got married back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kid came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kid came back too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, those are the two important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wife too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, three.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole shebang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even think the person they took to
babysit the kid made it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't trade any of the humans for
whatever you could trade humans for in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really missed out on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really derailed this podcast quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just took a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you're
smoking with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a big old smile on your
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're laughing at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're, we're kind of dabbed out over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're being goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hanging out with some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't always have to be uptight
podcast mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when we get high and ramble a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and Lindsay are speaking their sign
language to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can read each other's minds a little
bit unless you ask for the torch or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Q-tip or a can of butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're all fucking confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just grab all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one of these do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start throwing everything at each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't read your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the address is on 33.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you already put your phone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3398 South Broadway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inglewood?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: 3398.
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What time is that event going to start?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to start at 10 AM and it will
end at 4 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your event on 415.
[SPEAKER_00]: What time does that one start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a great 420 season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be an awesome time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what's
going on without the cannabis cup in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody used to just come for the high
times cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're coming to Colorado for 420
and you want to hang out, send us some
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter messages and we'll try to get
together and dab with people because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a weird 420 without a cannabis
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a rally in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, 420 is on Thursday,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 422 is that Elevate party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 422 shout out to our friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is redic cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be crowded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Redic cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have a huge sale on
everything at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a flyer in my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a good old grand old
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a party in the
backyard with a bunch of bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to get to as much of the stuff as
we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like it is my turn to hit the Vi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is flashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I hit it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it vibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now hold it and hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping they could hear me drop
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of vapor because my lungs felt
full, but there was not a lot of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I just smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you pack those wax capsules with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dabble extracts it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bango.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's banana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banana mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banana mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's banana mango terps in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it set at temperature wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I push the second bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went to the third bump,
you would get a gnarly, gnarly rip out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see it a bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second white was effective,
but that third one would be more my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I'd just roast that
capsule in like two rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more polite on my lungs than a
dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is certainly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like I just got punched in
the chest, which I sometimes enjoy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's going to do really well for
times when I need quicker medication and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't use a torch and such.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows when there's times and places
maybe, but they will be soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I really like this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sat on, maybe I'm a little biased
because I helped develop it, so I really
[SPEAKER_03]: like it, but I just really feel like it's
a really easy to use vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you're doing right now,
unscrew on the bottom and then it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: with that tool where you can push
everything right through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that as a possibility on a
vape pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually once they clog up, they're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ruined several.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put alcohol through that and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can dip Q-tips in alcohol and go
through there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it comes with these little
brushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with such a good cleaning kit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Jeff was referring to was ... On this
device, there is ... Mine's not hot if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to play with mine because yours is
going to burn you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that earlier, you guys.
We did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay needs adult supervision sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always, always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a helmet.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you press on the side of the mouthpiece
on the top, you will actually be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: pop it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside of it comes one of the little tiny
metal dab tools that comes in every single
[SPEAKER_03]: anything ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's connected to a small silicone
mouthpiece that's inside the mouthpiece to
[SPEAKER_01]: help cool down the smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in there to basically absorb the
heat, but it goes into the tunnel that
[SPEAKER_03]: goes into the chamber that holds the
capsule.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you unscrew the bottom and you take
the capsule out and there is a little dab
[SPEAKER_03]: tool that comes with the vie, it comes
inside the parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the thicker silver one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually fits through that hole in the
top of the mouthpiece and it goes through
[SPEAKER_03]: there and through the chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: If a capsule ever gets a little too snug
in there or ... Or sticky from hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what I see happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put one of the wax capsules in
there and it maybe leaks out a little bit
...
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just don't clean out your piece and
you just keep using it for often.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll get stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you're using the direct load mode,
which I'll talk about all the modes in a
[SPEAKER_03]: second, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can push the screen out and everything
and nothing will get stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is super easy to clean and no
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can literally run alcohol through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask you a random question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the three load modes
before I forget my question.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three different load modes are red is
capsules, which are these little stainless
[SPEAKER_03]: steel capsules that we were talking about
that you preload and you can put into the
[SPEAKER_03]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue is the direct mode where you throw a
screen into the bottom of the ... I guess
[SPEAKER_03]: it's technically the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heating oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you throw it into the bottom of it and
then you can pack herb on top of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also use the little capsule holder
to put herb in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been hanging out with Granny too
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking knocking shit over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny likes to knock shit over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a lot of cursing in a short
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of cursing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that aren't aware of Granny is like
the queen of knocking shit over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass is dangerous around Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes to ... She's clumsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her, but I have to tell this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday we were walking out of Canna
Canyon and she threw the back door so hard
[SPEAKER_03]: that I honestly thought she broke that
plastic cabinet that was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Gail, that was really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was like, she turns around and looks
at everybody in the club and she was just
[SPEAKER_03]: like, God, Granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone just started laughing and I'm
like, oh my God, she really almost broke
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, but that was ... Then we're
walking out and she's like, I think she
[SPEAKER_03]: said her dad used to say all the time or
Kevin says all the time that she doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: know her own strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: She really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny, I miss you and I love you and I
can't wait to see you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like I'll see you Saturday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's little funnels in the bottom
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look how fucking convenient that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought of everything for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this works for two different
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works for packing the capsules because
it fits into those and it also works for
[SPEAKER_03]: the direct mode as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you fill the little cylinders with
that also?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multi UCM learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to love this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it cool to smoke with,
but it's fun to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got so many modes and lights and
buttons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just hang out and play with it for
a couple of hours when you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it vibrates and it lets you know
when it's hot by vibrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a standby mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll keep the chamber, quote unquote,
warm, but not ready to use, so it won't
[SPEAKER_03]: burn your ... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really, really cool device.
That is pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the direct mode is blue and then
purple is the concentrates and it has
[SPEAKER_03]: these little wax capsules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wax capsules have a little heating
stone inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get this one open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has wax in it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all sticky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to pull the heating stone out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have ever used a health stone
pipe, it's a very small version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like ... Man, it's almost like a
piece of ceramic, but it's more porous,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it will hold heat and it sits inside
this little ... What are those made of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those aluminum?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inside of a little stainless steel
capsule that's honestly the size of a ...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a shell casing, honestly,
like a small caliber shell casing is what
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not get too specific, but it kind of
looks like a nine millimeter shell casing.
Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just load them up with wax and you put
them right in the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You screw that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You click it three times to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make sure it's on the right mode and
then you hold the button.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way to change the mode ... The
temperature settings are on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can change the temperature setting
just by pressing that button on the bottom
[SPEAKER_03]: one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes from ... There's four different
heat settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are numerical numbers to this and
you can check in the starter's guide for
[SPEAKER_03]: the actual ... If you want to know the
actual numerical numbers for what each one
[SPEAKER_03]: is, it's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to change it between the
different modes, you hold the temp button
[SPEAKER_03]: on the bottom of the device and then you
can actually click through the different
[SPEAKER_03]: colors, so blue, red, or purple.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it knows if you're using a wax
container, an herb container, or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just raw dogging it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice because that thing actually has
more than four heat settings because since
[SPEAKER_01]: it has three modes, each mode has its own
technical heat setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can technically get really crazy with
it and find your own personal liking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be like, well, I don't like the
direct mode with the capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put it on direct mode,
turn it up high, put a capsule in,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you could play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get real crazy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really like 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a personalized thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a crazy math equation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three times four times the amount of
settings times the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was never good at probability in high
school or college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know what the name of the
fucking class was, so you got further than
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probability is not a class.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, maybe I was ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The probability of me showing up for that
shit was low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that that's statistics
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just because I didn't go to a
fun school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a good student when the schooling is
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question that I wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this your first focus group?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the focus group
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it seems like you're going to do
it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very happy with how receptive they
were to our ideas and to our input.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there was not one thing that
I... I hope Barack hears this and listens
[SPEAKER_03]: to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He calls this the Lindsay... The Lindsay
Maze?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Lindsay Maze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I would make Chris do it first.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would get so hot, Jeff, that it would
burn your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first couple of ones that he brought
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're figuring out the heat settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first couple hits were a little hot on
the first... One or two hits, hot as hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make him do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they made me do it first,
I would be like... I would touch it here
[SPEAKER_03]: first, but I would really test it on my
lip before... Because it would get really
[SPEAKER_03]: hot, like blistering hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he calls that the Lindsay Maze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lindsay would complain so much and Lindsay
would make it such an issue that I had to
[SPEAKER_03]: fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that dab tool staying in there...
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you don't have to keep it in
there, but it just cools it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A piece of metal is going to suck up the
heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It cools down the vapor, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hands are all sweaty, so I can't get it
damn open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine are too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was just walking.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it doesn't go anywhere, which is
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sits nicely in there because a
little piece of the rubber, the silicone,
[SPEAKER_00]: that just cools you down so you don't fry
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't restrict the airflow at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genius, genius, genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other products are you sitting on and
developing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.
Nothing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blank face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your poker face sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to hear about it,
whatever the next product is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you when you start recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcasters don't want to hear that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to tell us when I stop
recording, so I'm going to reach over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press the stop button.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll stop for that, but you won't stop
for me dying?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to tell you I stopped at not
so that you told everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to lie to your face because
we're friends and that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to Vi for this sweet tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got number 248 of 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the shit out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let them know what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see this on my social media
because it already fits well in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it becoming a pacifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will shut me up at certain times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see next week when Jeff's
like, I put all my rigs away.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, all I do is dab out of
the Vi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see me posting just nothing but
Instagram selfies of me and the Vi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call it the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my new Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Bay out at the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that word so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for you guys to see all the
posts of Jeff being like, Vi's making me
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke flour again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love flour again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really funny you say that because I
almost ran over there and got some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog flour out of that container
to put in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The look on your face when I said grateful
dog flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are already finding capsules and
grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put the weeds way over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay's ready to go get the damn weed
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let everybody know what I
think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you guys on the podcast an
update in like two or three episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: because it'll be in my hand and I will
remember to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay, thanks for bringing me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said his name was Barack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Barack for letting me be a
part of your testing team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I do you good service.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys got anything else to talk about
since we're hanging out on a podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting at the table getting dabbed out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just tell you to come catch us at
the 420 event at Positive Vibes for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are able to figure out how to
get to the Dude Grows Cup, which will be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening shortly after this episode comes
out, I'm going to put this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be like Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday or Friday, because I've already
got a Thursday episode scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, if the numbers were out of order,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have done it like whatever
backwards, but it's still going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all the numbers are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it all together, the puzzle has
borders and it all adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, have you made any more gnomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you got to make more of those
gnomes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those gnomes are dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been going crazy for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the Chronic Boutique, once we calm
down with all the openings and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, I get back to my other side stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just auctioned one off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get up on that torch,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get up on the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: In due time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this podcast is right about two
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we've been on this podcast for
two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certain of the birthdate of this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done a lot of research,
but right around 420-ish is when this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast started two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks everybody that's been listening
since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's been three years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's been three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've almost been out here for
almost two now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now you make me want to do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody talk for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it because I don't want to fuck
it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, well, we've been out here for a
year and four months because it's April
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, then two years would make sense
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a hundred and two hundred episodes
would make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's been so much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do also because I can't
remember not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes any sense, I'm like,
yeah, I've just been doing that forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't on the thing I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I came out here for the first rec
cup, you just started the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I could have looked on my phone
for you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first episode is not in the feed,
so you can't find episode number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's in my computer, so I will be able
to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody like Fred Garvin or Kelvin
Medina, tweet me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how long you have been doing
this damn podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those guys that listen
religiously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool that I can say stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I asked a question on Facebook
about the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I can't find this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Message me within seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, here's the answer, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, damn, that's so rad that I can
have helpers like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not have been Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have been Rich Gannon, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get those names right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know them personally, so they're
just screen names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep all that stuff straight in
my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get a message from him now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was me, asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of hoping so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to message me,
I've said it a million times on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, but maybe you're a new listener,
maybe seeing the traveling stoner post
[SPEAKER_00]: this made you listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email is growfromyourheartathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter, it's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Facebook, search for the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, if you want to follow my
Instagram, check out some gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would enjoy what I'm posting
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can find Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's playing with her phone right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it The Traveling Stoner?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Traveling Stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a website.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's TheTravelingStoner.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: She finally did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: TheTravelingStoner.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I created all myself, so I'm very,
very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making a website's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely tries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tried me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely ... My website looks like
shit, and I don't have time to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just say, sorry, it looks like shit,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the focus has been lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the website up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've got the website up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The YouTube channel should be up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely have it up by the end of
the month for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of things in the works right
now, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a shop opening in May.
[SPEAKER_03]: On my website with stickers, t-shirts,
all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some guest writers coming up on the
blog in the next couple of months,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm actually going to be guest writing
for a couple of blogs in the next couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of months as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you got a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just doing a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many Instagram followers are you up to
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't know off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm at 11.7 or eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited you got the website going,
but now I don't have anything to troll you
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I still don't have the YouTube
channel up, so you can troll me about
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't do it by the first of next
month, then I got to troll you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet you'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast has a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 25 videos that you can see,
and there are a few more that you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still private.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get 50 videos made and posted to
YouTube, I will let all 50 of them be
[SPEAKER_00]: viewable because the viewers slash
listeners are fucking savages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new trend is to binge watch
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, I'll just wait until he
puts out 100 episodes and I'll stay up for
[SPEAKER_00]: four days and drink Dr. Pepper and smoke
dabs and just listen to every fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: episode and then send him an email about
every single one back to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people do now, it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen how you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got to wait until I've got at
least like 25 more to put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are just going to eat them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to look at you like a
hungry crocodile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where's the next one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, but it's hard to keep up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep doing this podcast because
I love putting it out there for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it is a challenge keeping
the hungry mouths, the hungry wolves fed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hungry ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not Joe Rogan, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we stalk you on some social media
at Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you go visit him, harass him at the
Chronic Boutique.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a Colorado medical marijuana
patient and you're not a dickhead,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a dickhead, he'll probably just
kick you right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, as long as you got money, you can
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be a dickhead all you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop that bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, he said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody please walk in and just fucking
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just go crazy in there and drop five
hundred dollars in the counter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tip him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill the tip jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend that bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're a medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and get the service you
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris will treat you kindly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We joke around a lot, but Chris will take
good care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows he knows about his medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's listened to the podcast long enough
that I know he's been trained properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is a fucking Terp kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves his Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people that love their products
this much are educated because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even an education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I heard somebody talking about
seeds today and they said something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was not wrong, but slightly inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to bite my lip and I just like it
flew out of my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, man, that's not true because of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry to have to interrupt you and
correct you, but I just couldn't hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the accurate part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me tell you the truth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a cannabis historian
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have to I am preserving the
cannabis future when it comes to genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and the stories and the way it evolved
with legalization here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're historians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the front lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to report the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like telling people what crosses of
certain strains are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's super important because
we're only going to cross those strains
[SPEAKER_00]: with more strains and more strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to get murky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's getting more convoluted as it
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's super important to kind
of I like to be sort of a historian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sort of I got some OCD like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the things I volunteered
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the ambassador to this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's part of my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to I try to be as accurate as I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I ever seem OCD about some weed,
that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want the I want the factual shit
out there, not the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay, you're yawning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to send you home and let you go
to bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay, you need to go to bed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we all need another dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start wrapping up the podcast so
that we can hang out and take some dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: without some mics going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank
everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost to 200 episodes of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going so long we don't even
know how fucking long it's been.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be another year on there that
we don't even know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'd dab myself into a whole
nother year without knowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you never know with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a head injury somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could have been seven years of
podcasting that I don't even know about
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to find it all on your
computer next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I got to do is go in there and look at
the computer and see you go to iTunes,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to podcast episode number one and see
when it was recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that'll tell me when all
this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody is going to tweet me and tell
me it'll be a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be Sammy Choncolas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a prize for the first
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado and you're over 21,
the prize will be much better than
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I see you in person, it gets even
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to follow all of us on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stock us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Cup is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you think the origin
of 420 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to my Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how you think 420 started.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the number 420 got attached to smoking
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about it on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll put out an episode on 420
where we talk about 420 being 420 and how
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 became 420 at 420 on 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay's head just 420'd all over itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up this podcast because
we are obviously rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's dry as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay needs a nap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, what do you need out of life right
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how simple you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: An artist's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge, huge shout out to
the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny, I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see you this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you next time.
