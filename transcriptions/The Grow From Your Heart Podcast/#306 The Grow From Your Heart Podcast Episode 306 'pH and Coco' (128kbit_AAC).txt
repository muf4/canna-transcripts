[SPEAKER_00]: yeah welcome back cannabis community it's
time for another episode of the grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart podcast your source for
cannabis news education and conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right if you're a new grower if
you're a professional grower if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: new smoker or a dedicated dabber if you're
a cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you I'm your host my friends call me
Rasta Jeff I want to thank you guys again
[SPEAKER_00]: for joining me this episode of the podcast
is brought to you by my friends at the
[SPEAKER_00]: hella dank seed company if you need new
genetics for your garden I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend the hella dank seed company you
can find them at dank seed store ladies
[SPEAKER_00]: and gentlemen roll up a fat joint pack up
the bong or start heating up that dab rig
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's time for another episode of
the grow from your heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back podcast world it's time for
episode 306 of the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast I like to start these episodes off
by letting you know what I've been dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: on today today I'm taking dabs of jet fuel
live resin full spectrum extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: green dot labs this stuff has been amazing
I've got a little tiny jar with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit left and when I crack open this jar
the aroma just fills this room this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room is filled with a skunky funky fuely
gassy sort of a smell I guess you would
[SPEAKER_00]: call it jet fuel I open this jar and the
smell that comes out is like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like you were kicking a skunk in
the ass all day and then you tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: rinse that aroma off with some diesel fuel
then you threw those hot shoes in the car
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sun all day and then you got in
the car and that overwhelming fuely skunky
[SPEAKER_00]: smell that hits your eyes and kind of
makes your eyes burn it makes you squint
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what this smells like and it is
beautiful I love it it is fuely it's
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky it's disgustingly beautiful and I
can't get enough of it the texture and
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance are also beautiful it is
perfectly golden and clear what I like
[SPEAKER_00]: about it a lot is the amount of crystals
or chunks and the amount of liquids or
[SPEAKER_00]: turps it is not too runny and too saucy
for me I don't prefer the really liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates I prefer the chunkier so this
is probably 70% chunks and 30% crystals
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just about right for my style I
really like it I was able to get a big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: dab on the dabber I really appreciate that
when I took the dab it gave me the most
[SPEAKER_00]: intense cottonmouth I haven't had
cottonmouth like that in quite a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: that was kind of nice it tasted really
well the cottonmouth had a pleasant taste
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the concentrate it also gave me
a nice eye high and also I found myself
[SPEAKER_00]: standing in the middle of the kitchen for
no reason after I took that dab I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: drink and I have eaten I wasn't hungry or
need a drink or anything but I took a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next thing I knew I was just
standing in the middle of the kitchen I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's a good sign that means the
concentrates are working when you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure why you're in a different room
alright ladies and gentlemen thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: joining me that's enough talking about
hash let's move this podcast forward let's
[SPEAKER_00]: cover a little bit of business and then we
will get to some emails it is 420 time

[SPEAKER_00]: podcast I have got great news if you used
to listen to a podcast called the spliff
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast that's the spliff SPL IFF and it
is the podcast POTCAST the spliff podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: hosted by Bo Nellis if you were a fan of
that you'd probably been missing the show
[SPEAKER_00]: she's been gone for quite a while but I've
got good news Bo is back in podcasting she
[SPEAKER_00]: put out an episode a couple of days ago
and it was wonderful it was so great to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear Bo's voice as soon as I heard that
intro music I got a smile on my face I hit
[SPEAKER_00]: play and I heard the little guitar I was
like oh there she is she's back those
[SPEAKER_00]: drums come in and then she's like hey
everybody it's so good to hear her voice I
[SPEAKER_00]: love Bo's podcast it is a completely
different style of podcasting than what I
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver it is a completely different
format it is cannabis based yes but she
[SPEAKER_00]: has a completely different approach to
cannabis than I do she talks more about
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects and more about the California
scene and also she's a woman so there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different approach just in the tone of the
show I've got this dude voice right I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot of energy she kind of talks like
a kindergarten teacher and I say that with
[SPEAKER_00]: all due respect Bo I love your show I love
it because it feels like my preschool
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher or my kindergarten teacher sitting
on a little stool in the class while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting Indian style and she's like gather
round class today we're gonna learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and I love it and today we're
gonna learn about terpenes and I fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: love the way Bo delivers her podcast I
love her product so big shout out to Bo
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're back you guys if you're
not listening to the spliff podcast you're
[SPEAKER_00]: missing something and you should give it a
chance all right I think that's all we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got before we can get into some emails
I've covered all the business I said shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Bo yeah you guys let's get into
some emails I like to answer emails from
[SPEAKER_00]: my listeners if you would like to send me
an email my email address is grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart at hotmail.com send me an email
I may read your email on a future podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: so this one goes like this also you guys
when you send me an email let me know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want me to say your name on the show
or not because oftentimes I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm supposed to say your name and I'd like
to if you want me to say your name I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to give you a shout out but I don't
want to call you out and get you in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble also make you uncomfortable or
anything like that so let me know and I
[SPEAKER_00]: will follow your guidance all right let's
get right into this email I apologize for
[SPEAKER_00]: that microphone sound here I'm trying to
get the mic out of my face so I can read
[SPEAKER_00]: this email goes like this hey sir I
oversee 288 plants in a drain to waste
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro commercial grow our feed schedule
has us adding A and B every single day we
[SPEAKER_00]: are not allowed to change the schedule we
must follow it to a T but for my own
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grow should I assume that I need
to add A and B every single day add A and
[SPEAKER_00]: B until the plants tell us it's good then
possibly every other day all right if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in cocoa I would recommend
that you just keep giving it nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: every day cocoa does not hold on to the
nutrients they fall right through there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of science I could go into on that
with low cation exchange and ionic bond
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not gonna go there that's just
too much talk to confuse people nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks to that cocoa so you do need to use
A and B every day I would also use some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a booster you're gonna need cal
mag in there if you were in flower you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna need a bloom booster you're also
gonna need maybe some Epsom salts once a
[SPEAKER_00]: week so I would do A and B every day and
then I would make a list of the boosts
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're gonna use like if you're gonna
use a bloom booster a sweetener like some
[SPEAKER_00]: carbs some enzymes some silicates maybe a
root inoculate maybe some cal mag and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly some Epsom salts I would make a
list of that stuff and on day one feed at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of that list you got your A and B
plus your cal mag on day two you got your
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B plus your enzymes on day three got
your A and B plus your bud booster and
[SPEAKER_00]: just go down that list and when you get to
the bottom go back up to the top and just
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle through that list and then that way
you can add some other things to it
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just the A and B and that way
you're not overdosing them or overfeeding
[SPEAKER_00]: them anything if you want to mix a few
things in there you can mix what they need
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would give it A and B every single
day if there's not nutrient if there are
[SPEAKER_00]: not nutrients in the soil or in the cocoa
the plants can't eat and if they can't eat
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not producing to their highest
level as long as you are phing everything
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not getting a salt buildup and
you're not overfeeding you should be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed A and B every day now there is a
second part to the email that I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: address he says also the pH window I
usually work with is 5.8 to 6.2 we are
[SPEAKER_00]: told that we must and he put must in
capitals so they fucking mean it we are
[SPEAKER_00]: told that we must fluctuate by 0.1 every
single day is it a benefit to hit every pH
[SPEAKER_00]: point or just keeping pH at 6 is good to
go I would stick with 6.3 or 6.4 you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit too low at 5.8 to 6.2 I would
come up I would go 6.2 at my lowest and
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.5 at my absolute highest but I would
rather be at 6.3 or 6.4 we mix a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients at my large facilities I run two
grows for three rivers and we mix 150
[SPEAKER_00]: about 200 another 180 ish like 350 450 500
something gallons there's 500 something
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of flowering nutrients mixed in
one room and then easily 500 gallons mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: in another and we get the pH to 6.3 or 6.4
whatever we designate we dial it in on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking money so it's not that hard you
have to have a pH pen and some patience
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bottle of pH down it's gonna start
off too high put in a cap full give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: good stir test it see what happens now
start putting in drops until you get where
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it go slow and get it to 6.3 or
6.4 don't overdo it all right now I would
[SPEAKER_00]: move the pH up that's the first thing I
would do now you're told that you must
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuate by 0.1 every single day why I
want to know why they think that why why
[SPEAKER_00]: do you need fluctuation plants love
consistency we're building automated
[SPEAKER_00]: systems we're building all these things on
timers everything is attached to a timer
[SPEAKER_00]: everything has got some sort of a schedule
we show up at a certain time you eat
[SPEAKER_00]: breakfast at a certain time you get lunch
at a certain time consistency is key I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure why we would change the pH by 0.1
every single day there is no benefit to
[SPEAKER_00]: that in my opinion I don't see the reason
I would adjust it to the proper pH where
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants can absorb the nutrients and
everything works well on purpose every day
[SPEAKER_00]: why would you change that so without
trying to go too far into pH I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: want to I don't have any notes on this I
wasn't gonna rant on this this is a side
[SPEAKER_00]: rant this is a general idea of how pH
works certain nutrients are available to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants at certain pH levels so if you
drew a like a half circle chart I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd go the other way go up you've got an
up graph a graph that's a half circle so
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like a sunrise right you got the
sunrise a half circle going up some
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are absorbable at pH around 5.8
some nutrients are most absorbable at pH
[SPEAKER_00]: around 6.8 we have found that almost
everything will be absorbed right around
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.2 that's where you can get everything
you may not get one nutrient the best you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not get the other nutrient the best
but you'll get everything efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: everything at 6.2 6.3 6.4 that's when you
start getting it all if you go too high
[SPEAKER_00]: some things aren't available if you go too
low other things are not available
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is efficiently available around
6.3 that's why we lock it in there now
[SPEAKER_00]: also here's what's gonna happen your
plants are going to go from freshly
[SPEAKER_00]: watered we're gonna call that freshly
watered that's heavy right that's as wet
[SPEAKER_00]: as they're gonna get now your pH is gonna
be at one state now when you leave they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna start drying up and as they get
drier the pH is going to change the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: level in your cocoa in your rhizosphere is
constantly changing based on the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture based on the temperature the
amount of oxygen that is all affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH inside your rhizosphere that
stands for potential hydrogen so think
[SPEAKER_00]: about if you've got your pot let's find a
vessel if this is your pot this is where
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your cocoa is you stick a meter in
there there's so much potential hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: now watch if I add this pen I have already
changed your amount of potential hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: because you had if this was a hundred
percent full of hydrogen not anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have to deduct for the pen so
every I should have put something wet in
[SPEAKER_00]: here so that it could dry if I spit into
here we've just changed the pH you know as
[SPEAKER_00]: my spit dries up you can see the amount of
space disappearing that my spit is taking
[SPEAKER_00]: up so the pH will change the water is
going to do that the moisture is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that the pH is going to change in your
rhizosphere constantly so you make it at
[SPEAKER_00]: six three and as it fluctuates it will do
that point one adjustment for you as time
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on I hope that made sense the way
that I did that I took a container dropped
[SPEAKER_00]: a pen lid into it you can't have as much
hydrogen in there because now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking up space from the lid right so
that's what the oxygen does that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: the water does it changes the pH in your
rhizosphere I hope that makes sense the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I said it so no there is no benefit to
changing your pH every day consistency is
[SPEAKER_00]: key in a large-scale grow man
congratulations on the position in a 288
[SPEAKER_00]: plant drained away system that's cool I'm
glad you were able to get yourself into
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry yes you do need to feed A&B
every day and I would work some other
[SPEAKER_00]: things into there and do not fluctuate
your pH so much and try to get it closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to six three that's what I would do all
right I know that you're not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: change that in your commercial grow maybe
you can just put this podcast on and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it on repeat and maybe the people that are
in charge will walk by and they'll hear
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then ask them why do I want it to
fluctuate I would ask why are you a person
[SPEAKER_00]: that asks why don't be afraid you look
like you're trying to learn just be like
[SPEAKER_00]: hey why do I want to do it differently
every day something that I like in a large
[SPEAKER_00]: facility is to train everybody to do
everything the same way every day because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm off for the next two days I will not
be there but I need to know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: things are happening the same way that
they would if I were there I just need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that it's happening so we train
everybody to do everything the same every
[SPEAKER_00]: day we take notes we write it down we use
Google documents I know what everybody fed
[SPEAKER_00]: every plant today because there's a Google
spreadsheet that says hey I gave room a
[SPEAKER_00]: this I gave room B this we try to keep
track so I don't see why you would want to
[SPEAKER_00]: vary and deviate keep it fucking
consistent so much better all right dude
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for the great email you guys once
again if you'd like to send me an email my
[SPEAKER_00]: email address is grow from your heart at
hotmail.com I would love to answer your
[SPEAKER_00]: emails ask me some questions all right
here's another email this person does not
[SPEAKER_00]: say if they want me to use their email or
say their name or not anyway the email
[SPEAKER_00]: goes like this top of the day to you Rasta
Jeff question for you which way do you
[SPEAKER_00]: personally prefer to trim wet or dry and
would you mind explaining why I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant however I personally do not use
these days I grow from my family and
[SPEAKER_00]: friends I appreciate your time and advice
your podcast contains a plethora of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and I enjoy tuning in thanks for
all that you do wow that's a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff right there first of all you are
welcome thanks for noticing that I do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of stuff thanks for the compliment
thanks for the email you're very welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: first he says or they say I don't know if
this is a man or a woman or both since
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 2018 they say question for you which
way do you personally prefer to trim wet
[SPEAKER_00]: or dry I prefer after many years of
experimenting and wasting a lot of time I
[SPEAKER_00]: have learned that I prefer dry trim dry
trim is it's easier it's more efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: it's less time-consuming it's less of a
pain in the ass and in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment it's more it makes a lot more
sense and I'll explain that I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I cover the whole email I love
the plant I love the plant too and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: glad you're on our team you say however I
personally do not use these days you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: for family and friends and that's cool
you're not even consuming the product but
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a passion for growing it that's
awesome everybody needs a good grower then
[SPEAKER_00]: you say you appreciate my time and advice
then you're very welcome I'm glad you you
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me an email to say thank you and then
you say the podcast contains a plethora of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and you enjoy tuning in that
makes everything worth it so I'm glad you
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting a plethora of knowledge keep
tuning in now let's talk about why I
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer wet or dry trim wet trim is kind of
a crucial thing that's like we cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant if we're gonna wet trim it we
got a fucking wet trim it now is the time
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to go you're under the gun there's
no mistakes there's lots of pressure you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't stop until you're finished you just
have to trim and then it's kind of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: super sticky it's kind of a pain in the
ass also yours it's so sticky I like dry
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming the way that I like to do it is
just before harvest I will go take off all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the big leaves all the leaves with the
petiole they get snapped right off the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant several days before harvest then we
continue flushing then on harvest day cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down the plants and hang them upside down
now you've just got plants hanging upside
[SPEAKER_00]: down they will start to get crunchy once
this once the stems pop once they start
[SPEAKER_00]: popping when you bend them crunch then I
will put them into bins I will cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: main part of the stick out and then I'll
leave a bunch of stick in there but I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into big Rubbermaid or Tupperware
bins they are two feet long by a foot wide
[SPEAKER_00]: and about 18 inches tall those are the
Rubbermaid bins I like to use I can fit a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple plants in there maybe three or four
plants the size I grow them so I put the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry plants in there I cut out a lot of the
big stick but I leave some of it because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's moisture in there that's gonna
come into play so I have excuse me I have
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that kind of kind of snap now
they've gone into these Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_00]: containers then I will put the lid on them
it's a good idea to wrap them in butcher
[SPEAKER_00]: paper just put one good wrap of butcher
paper around them that will absorb any
[SPEAKER_00]: excess water that wants to come out that
will help you so lock them in there seal
[SPEAKER_00]: them up then once a day just go in there
and open that container and let out all
[SPEAKER_00]: the funky air spin them around so where
the buds that were on the bottom are now
[SPEAKER_00]: on the top leave them open for a few
minutes and close them again now you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got dried buds that are basically just
drying and curing now you can go in at any
[SPEAKER_00]: time and get one of those Rubbermaid
containers and just carry it out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table and just start trimming you can dry
trim that product whenever it's gonna stay
[SPEAKER_00]: in there dried and cured in stasis forever
until it gets ridiculously dry but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: seal it up and put it in a room with
humidity control we keep it in a room with
[SPEAKER_00]: a dehumidifier and a humidifier on they
fight each other all day but we keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: room 50% humidity constantly you'll hear
that dehumidifier click off and two
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds later here comes the humidifier
like yep it hit 52% and then they battle
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it'll go down to 49% and the
other one will come on so it's constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% in that room but that's what keeps our
buds at just the right squishiness just
[SPEAKER_00]: the right texture we keep them in the
container sealed but a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture exchange is you can't keep it
they're not all airtight so we keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room and they get perfect so we
cut them down let them get to where they
[SPEAKER_00]: snap once they snap we put them in the
containers then you can just open them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry trim them whatever you can cut the
buds off the sticks and you can trim them
[SPEAKER_00]: up by hand you can hold the bud in your
hand and knock this the leaves off with
[SPEAKER_00]: your thumb just use your thumb just like
you're playing a video game or just use
[SPEAKER_00]: little like it's little thumb scissors and
just knock the leaves off it's not nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: as sticky it's not nearly as messy it's
not as much of a pain in the ass you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: go through as many gloves and also as
you're dry trimming you can take those
[SPEAKER_00]: dried buds and just throw them right into
the bag because that's ready for retail
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for packaging ready for whatever
you're gonna do with it and then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got this little pile of trim that you can
turn into whatever you're gonna do with
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you can weigh that finished
product as soon as you're done trimming it
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you're paying your trimmer by weight
if you say hey I'll give you this much per
[SPEAKER_00]: pound then he's got dry trim he's just
pulling it off trimming it up throw it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a bucket trimming it off throw it in a
bucket trim it off throw in a bucket and
[SPEAKER_00]: then at the end of the day you can put
that dry product on the scale and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see how much they actually did trim with
wet product it's wet you don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: much is there that shit could dry up 30 50
75% maybe 80% depending on how soon before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest it got watered so I like dry trim
it's less of a rush it's less of a fiasco
[SPEAKER_00]: it's less of there's less pressure you
don't have to just you're not under the
[SPEAKER_00]: gun as much there's not as much of a
deadline with the dry trim you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: seal them up in containers and as long as
they're sealed they're gonna stay the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are you can just trim them up
when you need them so maybe maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have anywhere for that product to go
maybe you don't have a patient that needs
[SPEAKER_00]: it maybe you're not hustling it maybe
you're not flipping it maybe you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have time to trim it you can just sit
there dry it as long as it's sealed up you
[SPEAKER_00]: can just sit there with the leaves on it
so that's partly why I like it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just less messy it's wet it is not as
sticky it's not as much of a pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ass so that's why I prefer dry trim it
makes more sense to me Mike and I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: wet trim for hours and we would be at it
all night wet trimming we would start
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming after work or whenever because
you can't trim during the day when
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's around you got to wait till the
nighttime when people are kind of low-key
[SPEAKER_00]: because it fucking stinks and then you got
to be in it for hours so we'd start
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming in the evenings and we'd go until
sunrise and then try to go to work the
[SPEAKER_00]: next day half exhausted we wore ourselves
out wet trimming we would be super sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: we would over trim because you trim and
then that blood dries up and it shrinks
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of those leaves you trimmed off
would have just shrunk up you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even have seen it anyway so yeah dry trim
is better in my opinion in most commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: applications they're doing dry trim
because it's such a rush there's such a
[SPEAKER_00]: deadline that's such a fiasco to do wet
trim so dry trim is the way to go in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion once those buds are dried and
trimmed up you can already weigh them also
[SPEAKER_00]: so that feels good it's nice to know it's
like chip chip chip chip chip chip chip
[SPEAKER_00]: two pounds cool I did that it just feels
good I said two pounds don't don't kill
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself if you can't trim two pounds in a
day one is good I hope you could do two I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope so but one is cool all right you guys
