[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Rasta Jeff here taking a little
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been packing up seeds all evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to record episode 485 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Fortismo
full spectrum extract from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of crescendo and HSB.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor on the package is described as
98 octane and dumpster, and I completely
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say it smells like gas and dumpster and
a little bit of bar trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds disgusting,
but it is definitely an appealing aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says this
product contains 60.8% 85% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the Fortismo full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a four gram jar, and when I
cracked it open, it was all one big
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the impressive concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers and growers, in this episode,
I am going to read an email about strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big giant Grow From

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I did say that I
was going to read an email about strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from our friend Andrew
in Massachusetts and it goes just like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Andrew from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could do an episode
on some of your strains that are similar
[SPEAKER_00]: but different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is feminized, but how
different is it from Firefly or Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunrise or Sonic Boom or perhaps Orange
Gasm versus Sun King?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Strawberry Starburst versus Pure
Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some being so close genetically like
cousins or aunts or nieces, I'm wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: if there will be noticeable differences
between strains or should I settle for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I can find in stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just chopped down my first Arise and I
could not be more impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to run some more iry genetics
and I just would like to get as clear an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea as possible of the traits of anything
that shares common ancestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign it with much love from
Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Andrew, there are a lot of great
questions in this email so let's get right
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to catch people up just in case
people are not aware, I am a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the sole breeder for iry genetics
premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make regular and feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with a strain called Arise that is
one of my most popular females and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course I use an Arise male plant for many
other crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also am known for the Lemon Jeffrey and
a few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's focus more on the strains this
person asked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted everybody to know what this
message stemmed from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question is Lemon Jeffrey is
feminized but how different is it from
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly or Lemon Sunrise or even Sonic
Boom?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very good question because
all of those strains have very similar yet
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctly different characteristics in
the description and many of them have very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar parents in their lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey, what is Lemon Jeffrey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is a female golden goat that
was reversed to create feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that feminized pollen on a female
lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what created Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is a reversed golden goat to
a female lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into great detail on that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this episode we will describe it as a
tropical lemon candied flavored sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really quick description.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then how is the Lemon Jeffrey
different from Firefly?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk quickly about Firefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly is a cross of lemon skunk and
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon skunk is the same lemon skunk as
used in the Lemon Jeffrey cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is lemon skunk to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very similar to the Lemon Jeffrey
but you are going to get some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: funky, gassy, it doesn't have the sweet
tropical flavor from the golden goat as
[SPEAKER_00]: much in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have golden goat but it has only
got a quarter of the golden goat in its
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage as compared to half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've watered down the golden goat a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put some OG Kush and Kim D flavors
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to the Lemon Jeffrey
however it is not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is the flavor and the
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Firefly will get a little bit funkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit more of a lemon
pledge sort of a thing and it also grows a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit taller with a little bit more
dense of a bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one you ask about is the Lemon
Sunrise and that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is Lemon Jeffrey different from Lemon
Sunrise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Sunrise was my non-feminized
response to requests for non-fem Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people fell in love with Lemon
Jeffrey but they did not like feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have a preference of feminized
or non-fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people did not want feminized Lemon
Jeffrey seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pollinated the Lemon Jeffrey with my
prized Arise male and that made Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's backtrack and talk about the
differences between the Firefly and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are non-feminized strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly like I said earlier has more of
the skunky, dank, funky aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say more of a stank lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Sunrise is going to have a
softer sweeter lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for a lemon pledge,
gassy, dirty feet and lemons, lemons and
[SPEAKER_00]: funk, lemons and kush, the Firefly is the
way to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more of a softer, sweeter,
lemon sorbet kind of a flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lemon Sunrise is the route for that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Firefly and the Lemon Sunrise will
grow very similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Firefly will make a little bit more
dense of a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Sunrise will make a little
airier of a bud but it's going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bigger of a bud also.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will weigh the same in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's backtrack even more and talk
about the Lemon Jeffery and how it varies
[SPEAKER_00]: from all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Jeffery is different from the
Firefly because it is straight soft lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: head candy flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as if you dumped out a box
of lemon heads and smelled the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of lemon sorbet, country time
lemonade powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more gentle is the way I explain it
but it is feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that one really stands out from
the rest of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is another cross that is very
similar in this mix which you asked about
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom is actually lemon O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes cross to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes came from our friends at Ethos
Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing great work over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes, I discovered her in a commercial
facility and I fell in love with that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't beat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't cause it problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stress it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like spider mites and it just
seemed to eat like a champ and no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what we did to it, it put out giant colas
that always smell like lemon lime Gatorade
[SPEAKER_00]: and I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the Lemon O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed that to my rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to increase the vigor and
potency of the Lemon O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes and it absolutely worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more of a Gatorade lemon lime sort
of a flavor more than the lemon flavor of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other strains we have talked about
previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sonic Boom does not have the lemon
skunk as the Lemon Jeffrey, the Firefly or
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lemon Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is going to be a vastly different
cross from the other three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see very large differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that wraps up the talk about
the Lemon Jeffrey versus Firefly,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Sunrise and Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just quickly, Lemon Jeffrey is a feminized
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it stands out mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces that soft lemon, lemon head,
country time lemonade flavor sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the Firefly is that same lemon skunk
crossed to the rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a cushy, gassy, stanky lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Sunrise is the Lemon Jeffrey to
a rise that brings the sweet lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings a hint of the gas, but not
nearly as much as the Firefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got the Sonic Boom and that is
a vastly different flavor profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lacks all of the lemon skunk traits
because it does not have the lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: in there at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's move forward to the second
part of the question, which is Orangegasm
[SPEAKER_00]: versus Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common parent in Orangegasm and
Sunkiss is a Platinum Tangy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum Tangy came from our friends at
Garden of Weed Inn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a female Platinum Girl Scout
cookies pollinated by a male Tangy plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that was known as Julius and that makes
Platinum Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the Platinum Tangy plant for
a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows nice and squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of getting tall and lanky,
it makes a nice wide bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finishes fairly early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nice robust stalks, so it doesn't
need a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very nice leaf shape and
structure and the leaves that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliated are very obvious because of the
size and shape of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how early it finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're done growing it,
what stands out about the finished product
[SPEAKER_00]: is this amazing orange flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oranges are super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, you get a hint of that
Girl Scout cookie funkiness and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: think it makes a beautiful balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the Platinum Tangy that comes
from our friends at Garden of Weed Inn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with that one in a
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired a cut and I've been working
with it for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made quite a few strains from that
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Orangegasm and the Sunkiss and also
the Michelangelo come from that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about the
differences between Orangegasm and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is the Platinum Tangy cut
pollinated by that reversed Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are made side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm and Lemon Jeffrey are made in
the same room from the same reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a Platinum Tangy female
pollinated by a reversed Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one brings out a lot of citrusy,
sweet orange flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get a little bit of orange rind
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes may express a flavor of
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a hint of grapefruit turps
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the most common aroma or
flavor, but it will pop up in some
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss is that same Platinum Tangy female
pollinated by the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to see a lot of
similarities in the Orangegasm and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss because the Arise also has the
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is the mother of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are also going to get a little bit
of funk in there because it's also got
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to get some of the
Daybreaker traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to get Arise traits and we
are going to get those Platinum Cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Tangy traits in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes of the Sunkiss stay short
and squat and grow bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Orangegasm will do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main difference you are going to
see is that we may get a little bit taller
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes from the Sunkiss and we may get
longer finishing phenotypes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also may get a hint of funkier,
nastier, cushier aromas from the Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is that those are a
regular and a feminized seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main outstanding difference
between the two of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the
Michelangelo since we are here you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mention that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo is that same Platinum Tangy
female pollinated by a reversed Blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies female that made pollen so we
created the Michelangelo feminized line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo generally has the same growth
characteristics as the Orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally short, squatty plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 8 week finishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find some outliers in all of
these that are shorter and longer
[SPEAKER_00]: finishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally we've got short,
squatty plants with a very orange dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference with the Michelangelo is
that we bring a little bit of a grapey,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue raspberry, funky sort of a blue
nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe those blue lollipops we used to suck
on when we were kids that turned our whole
[SPEAKER_00]: face blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of that flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like we took some oranges and
rolled them around in grape fun dip or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that or a blue raspberry
fun dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really neat flavor combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very candy, very orangey, very funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sometimes you'll get a hint of that
cookies from the Tahoe and the cookies in
[SPEAKER_00]: the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Michelangelo is very similar to the
Orangegasm and the Sunkiss but it also has
[SPEAKER_00]: a little pizzazz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of blue color on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it sounds crazy that I express
flavors in colors but if you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: it when you see red stuff you always think
it's either fruit punch or strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see blue shit you think it's
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see orange you think it's orange
flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain works very much in that sort of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why the TMNT line got named the
way it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've explained that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's recap on the main differences on the
Orangegasm, the Sunkiss and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelangelo is feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is Sunkiss is a
non-feminized version of these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss is going to be completely orangey,
a little bit of funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm, orangey, maybe a little bit
more citrus, maybe some grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Michelangelo you're going to get
oranges with all those blue and purple
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors attached to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward and talk about
Strawberry Starburst versus Pure Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are very different crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Strawberry Starburst is Strawberry
Fields from Crockett Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I acquired at another commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows giant colas that smell like
strawberry candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always satisfied with the harvest
weight and the appearance, but I was never
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied with the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal was to pollinate it with my
King Solomon and increase the potency of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Strawberry Fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That created Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my goal spot on with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Love is a cross of Zac Haze to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zac Haze is Killer Haze and Strawberry
Cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the strawberry flavors are very
different than the Strawberry Starburst
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of an actual strawberry
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Strawberry Starburst is more like a
strawberry gum, a strawberry candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been described as those candies
that your grandma has in the candy dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wrapped in the strawberry looking
wrapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Strawberry Starburst has that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pure Love is more like an actual
strawberry air freshener sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big difference there in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Pure Love has some haze in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get the Killer Haze
traits are going to pop out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to make the plants take a
little bit longer to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get a little bit taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have possibly more of
like a psychedelic sort of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Strawberry Starburst is a little
bit more candy, bubble gummy, possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pure Love, you're going to get more of
the funky aroma from the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've both got the Arise parent in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get some of that funk in
there from the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes more dominantly in the Pure Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want strawberry candy,
watermelons, if you want something to
[SPEAKER_00]: press and make rosin out of, Strawberry
Starburst is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make BHC, Joe out of
it, Pure Love is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's got a little bit more of a real
strawberry flavor as compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also going to bring a little bit
of that dirty foot, gassy, cushy sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one we should include in there is
the Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael is the Strawberry Starburst
pollinated by that blueberry cookies that
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael brings that really sweet
strawberry candy flavor, but it's also got
[SPEAKER_00]: that blue raspberry funky wang to it,
those blue and purple flavors added on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really makes a really unique strawberry
blueberry combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really bubble gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can almost be a watermelon blueberry
bubble gum sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of really unique flavors
that come from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main difference between Strawberry
Starburst and Pure Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Starburst is going to be more
strawberry candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Love, you're going to get some of
that gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Raphael is strawberries with a
wang to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the Raphael is a feminized
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two are regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure by now you've noticed that I
am using a lot of the same strains in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of my crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using different pollen donors on
different females to create diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of branch out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using several females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am mainly using that King Solomon as my
main real male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also using several females and
reversing them to create more crosses from
[SPEAKER_00]: proven and trusted females, which I know
are reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with many of these
crosses for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very verified stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that everything I've got is exactly
what it is labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where that person got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tested all of these things several
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a very nice stable to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: My downfall or my limiting factor is that
I am limited by the number of plants I can
[SPEAKER_00]: keep because of Colorado laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have access to commercial facilities
and I work with large grows, but most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my breeding happens in a personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am limited to the amount of mother
plants I can keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am limited to the amounts I can flower
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really makes my number of keeper
plants limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do have friends that can keep
plants for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have plenty of other friends around
here that do have gardens that maybe I can
[SPEAKER_00]: have them keep my mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a breeder, as somebody who relies
on this is like part of my life,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who I think I'm in love with
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know I'm in love with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to rely on anybody else to
keep my genetics, my business,
[SPEAKER_00]: my passion alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do my best to keep my very favorite
mothers to where I can keep my selected
[SPEAKER_00]: moms, my selected males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I still have enough room on my
plant count to do some pollination,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make some new crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then occasionally I have to call a few
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to sprout some seeds and I have to
start fresh with lower numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you see a lot of repeats and
a lot of things from the same sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: lines working in my projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are trusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a breeder, that is part of what you
rely on me for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I rely on myself and my
testers to test these lines for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lines that come out in 2020 have been
being tested since 2019 and possibly 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it takes me a little while to
get products out because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly test them to make sure that
when you spend your money, you are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: a reliable seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when you grow that, you'll have
something worth showing off, something
[SPEAKER_00]: worth consuming, something to make it
worth all of your time, your energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: your effort and your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know how much effort and
dedication we put into our grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main limiting factor to keep my
breeding from expanding is plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only allowed to have so many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, oftentimes I do coal
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I either get new plants from friends and I
breed with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I make sure that that offspring is
worth using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send out those seeds to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will grow those seeds myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have friends in commercial
facilities that will let me run a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in one of their test rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can really see what's happening
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I scrap projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I say, we probably shouldn't
give these seeds out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I go, holy shit, I cannot wait
to get these seeds out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I make a first cross,
I don't make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give them the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a couple of hundred so we can
test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if it's good, then I go back and I
make enough to where we can actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: it out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a long process making,
testing and verifying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am mainly limited by the amount of
keepers that I can keep because of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were more questions in this
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, with some of your strains being
so close genetically, like cousins or
[SPEAKER_00]: aunts and nieces, I'm wondering if there
will be noticeable differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: strains or if I should just settle on
whatever I can find in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on which strains you were
referring to, you may see very subtle
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may be so close that you may
just want to grab what is in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I am only able to keep so many
mother plants and father plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: some strains will never be made again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they sell out, they are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a jar of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a bunch of packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're requested by the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot make any more of those because I
was forced or I chose to get rid of one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mother plants or the father plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or part of that cross and I can no longer
make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would grab what is in stock when you
can, if you can't find the exact strain
[SPEAKER_00]: you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last paragraph of this email says,
I just chopped down my first run of Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: and I could not be more impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see some photos of your
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't get photos while it was
growing, I hope to see photos of your next
[SPEAKER_00]: grow of iry genetics seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I cannot wait to run
more iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just would like to get as clear an idea as
possible of the traits of anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: shares common ancestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did a pretty good job of giving
you descriptions of things with very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar traits and similar parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more questions, I would love
a follow-up email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know my email address is
growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signed his email with much love from
Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Andrew, thank you for the great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to hearing from you in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see photos of your iry genetics
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for you for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get back to packaging up seeds
for the endo expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that the endo expo is coming
to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics has a booth at the endo
expo in Denver, January 25th and 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 25th is industry day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 26th is open to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out the endo expo website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your tickets before they sell out
because it will sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your travel arrangements early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a nice hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a sweet Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you at the
endo expo.

up.
Thank you.
