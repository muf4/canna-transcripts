[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what's up internet world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Rasta Jeff and it's time for episode
489 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of First
Class Funk Live Batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of GMO and Jet Fuel
Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
hashy grape, fuel and garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that that is completely
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a fuel and garlic aroma and then
as you exhale that hashy grape sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: lingers on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great description, great buzz,
great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package it says that
the product contains 68.7% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the flavor, aroma and the
buzz from the First Class Funk Live
[SPEAKER_00]: Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read an
email from a long time listener.

[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into that email I said I
was going to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a long time listener,
someone who I also consider a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Zane
Decker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Zane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to hear from you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message from Zane goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada is taking off with sustainable
cannabis growing, utilizing aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What companies in Colorado can I support
that are using sustainable techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, what sustainability
techniques do you use or would you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend for commercial or home use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep slinging that green thingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not sign it, but I know who it's
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Zane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zane, this is a great question,
and I'm glad you brought this to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into our attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different things to
touch on when it comes to sustainably
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and producing cannabis,
especially when it comes to commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of waste in the production,
then there is an excessive amount of waste
[SPEAKER_00]: in the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about
sustainability and commercial growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's first talk about this first question
that Zane asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what companies in Colorado can I
support that are using sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I cannot tell you off the
top of my head any companies that boast or
[SPEAKER_00]: brag about using sustainable techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few no-till grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few boutique style grows that
are trying to do it sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the commercial grows in
Colorado, in my experience, are turn and
[SPEAKER_00]: burn waste machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want plants on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want those plants in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want them harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want them processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want them turned into whatever
product they're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need that on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want the money to come back so they
can pay to repeat that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, I cannot point you
directly to any companies in Colorado that
[SPEAKER_00]: are working on sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he follows up with, furthermore,
what sustainability techniques do you use
[SPEAKER_00]: or would you recommend for commercial or
home use?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to follow this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being mindful is the first step to being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will admit that I am a salt grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just not my method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how I learned how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how I prefer to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like going full organic,
if you like growing no-till, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the way that makes you happy and
don't bitch at other people for doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do understand that I am having
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having salts shipped across the
country for my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to think about how many lights I've
got running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need all of these lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: In most situations, I'm working in very
large environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking 100 or 500 lights in
flower at a time, which gives me 100 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 veg lights, sometimes more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if we can move this row of
plants over here and turn off four lights
[SPEAKER_00]: for a week, that will save us a little bit
of money and that helps environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: and that keeps us a little bit more
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think about lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes with lighting, we also have
less HVAC to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not running that many lights,
I don't need that much HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a couple of things that I
look at immediately when I go into a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: to find ways to cut costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my jobs is to cut costs in the grow
as well as increase productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find ways to turn off a few lights by
pushing a few plants closer together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to be mindful about is
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said, I know I'm having my
nutrients shipped across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have shifted to mostly powdered
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the nutrients we are purchasing
that are in bottles are mostly water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are paying to have water driven
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are paying shipping for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can buy powdered nutrients,
I would suggest a powdered nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I understand that we've got the
things we like and the methods we prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like new millennium nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that people like different
things and we have different preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to use your mind and think
about, do you want to pay for the
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this good for the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to be cost effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the next thing I think about is
shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be put on a truck and
sent to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the things we use are not locally
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to source things that are at least
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I have to have stuff sent from
California or other regions, but I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get most of my stuff from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of shipping and shipping
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also work on sustainability by working
on what is known as best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the best practices in your
commercial?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your culture in your grow
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing in your environment,
in your grow, in your facility to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you are leaving as little footprint
on our planet as possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is in your employee handbook?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is in your standard operating
procedure that helps you protect yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things in your grow
that you can adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, the first things in
most grows I go to, I look at how many
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are on and how many plants are
under each light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we simply move a few plants over
10 feet and turn off a whole entire row of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that each grow will have
something like that you can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a huge leak where your HVAC is
just blowing fresh air right out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building and wasting all that cool air you
just put in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you pumping CO2 out as you exhaust the
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you mixing your nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you wasting nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important thing is pesticide
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you handling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you mixing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you applying pesticides safely,
especially in an outdoor environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that going?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be aiming at the cannabis plant
directly in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the wind taking the rest of that
pesticide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it blowing on the orchard down the row
from you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to destroy the bugs in your
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you destroying the bugs on my
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got other plants that are natural and
local to my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your pesticide is going
to do to those plants out there in my
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful looking yard, to my desirable
insects that are out there taking care of
[SPEAKER_00]: my yard, having a little nature like they
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get rid of the bugs on the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get rid of the bugs in my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful with your pesticide
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is really going to be
contradictory to the last thing I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to wear gloves and personal
protective equipment when we're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow at all times, especially when
handling pesticides and other chemicals or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to not waste a bunch of gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of how many gloves you were
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we can go
through a box of gloves in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are one or two guys wearing the
same size gloves, you think about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you come in, you put on a pair of gloves,
you do a job, then you probably change
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves and use the men's room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wash your hands, you come back,
you put on another gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already at two pairs of gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two pair of gloves before the first break
of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a break, you do whatever you do
at break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come back, you put on more gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're working hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you break a glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put on more gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we go between five and 12 pair of
gloves per person per day in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can add up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that much wasted latex in a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about, first of all,
how much latex you're throwing away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting that into a landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also that had to be shipped to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're wasting stuff two times when
we're wasting too many gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we have to use that stuff,
but be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing we need to be more
mindful of is the wasting of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have overflowed a reservoir in every
single grow in which I have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to say I don't do it,
but we all need to pay more attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of water we are using and
wasting in our commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we water a room a few times,
we should know how many gallons of water
[SPEAKER_00]: that room needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not mix up too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not be throwing away excess
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were throwing that away,
where is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you dumping your excess nutrient
solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were running a drain to waste
system or you've got runoff water,
[SPEAKER_00]: where is that water going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going in a floor drain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that once it hits the floor drain,
that's out of your mind, but where does it
[SPEAKER_00]: go after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to take some water and dump
it out back or dump it somewhere in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, where is that water going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going right into the drain that
runs back to the river?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to some sort of recycling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just draining right into the dirt
right in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all the bushes outside of your grow
growing rapidly and you can't figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're dumping all that nutrient
water out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the bunnies eating that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you destroying the natural environment
that should be out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting thirsty just talking about
wasting water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day we may run out of water and when
we do, we are fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful how much water you are mixing
when you're mixing a nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful if you're filling a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set a timer and don't let that shit
overflow onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running a drain to waste or if
you're disposing of some sort of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: be mindful of where that water is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, out of sight,
out of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it goes down the drain, who cares
what happens to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably should care what happens once
it goes down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main tips I can give about being more
sustainable are basically being more
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful and being aware of what we are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simple steps that we may not have
paid attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to recycle more appropriately if
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waste is a big cost in the grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waste is a big cost to our environment in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's kind of work into some things we
can do on a larger scale that will help us
[SPEAKER_00]: be more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the first obvious things to
help us be more sustainable would be to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors is much more cost effective than
an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pay for lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is the best natural light ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how everything started is it all
grew because the sun gave it light and
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you're growing outdoors,
you don't have to add an air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't air condition the entire
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're not wasting HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that much more chemical gas that is
not being released into our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting better already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand we can't all grow
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: My outdoor grow season is very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We build greenhouses and hang lights in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the sunshine when we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We supplement with grow lights as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand we can't all grow
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an ideal world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you are forced to use grow lights,
what would be a most helpful option would
[SPEAKER_00]: be solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with that is it costs a
little bit of money to install.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to put the money out up
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got to pay for itself over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies, a lot of environments,
a lot of situations cannot afford to put
[SPEAKER_00]: the money for solar out right up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pay for lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pay for air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we move indoors, let's try to utilize
the power of solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can take that energy from the
sun and we can still power our plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: that natural sun energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes to solar, we have to do
our research because does it cost more
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to the environment to make those
solar panels than it does to actually run
[SPEAKER_00]: the electricity?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of thinking to be done when
it comes to designing big facilities and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to set up solar and trying to think
ethically and trying to put your money
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere where you're not causing more
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously growing outdoors would be our
first step to sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step to becoming more sustainable
and environmentally friendly would be to
[SPEAKER_00]: run some sort of a no-till type of
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A no-till environment would give you much
less waste and waste is a huge problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I've got a room with 200 three
gallon pots filled with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got a dumpster filled with three
gallon pots filled with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were running no-till, we would
basically pull out the main root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would put in another plant,
backfill with some compost, and we would
[SPEAKER_00]: be good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be very minimal waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could actually throw that root ball and
that leftover stick and probably most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my other sticks and all my trim right into
my compost bin and it would become food
[SPEAKER_00]: again for my plants in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a much more sustainable way to
operate a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, in my experience,
it is much more difficult to operate a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environment in a no-till type
of setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure people are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they kick ass at it, but it is
not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a salt grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bottled nutrients grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up a drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to train guys where they can
feed these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: To these plants at this week and I can
train them to do that in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and I'm going to get the same
outcome in multiple environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I like my regimen,
but going full no-till going fully organic
[SPEAKER_00]: would be much more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be much more environmentally
friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be fully organic, which is
already a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to ship all of those
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big advantage and there is much
less waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said a minute ago, most of the
waste from a no-till grow can be put right
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will become composted and you can use
it right back on the plants in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will feed your plants again and
keep that cycle going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is very minimal waste in that type
of a setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first tips to becoming more
sustainable would be to learn to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is much more environmentally
friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that is not always
everybody's option.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step would be to learn to grow
no-till or at least fully organically and
[SPEAKER_00]: stop shipping bottles around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next steps to learning to grow more
sustainable are being mindful in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you do in your grow situation to
save some tread on the earth and also save
[SPEAKER_00]: some tread on your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will go very well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll both make you feel very good about
your choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are in your grow and you're
mixing your nutrients or you're applying
[SPEAKER_00]: your pesticide or you're doing whatever
you're in your grow doing, be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, oh right there, I'm probably fucking
up the environment just a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: than I need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably dial back my footprint
just a little bit just by skipping that
[SPEAKER_00]: step or by maybe doing this one extra
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be more mindful in your garden,
pay more attention to what you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and look for opportunities to be more
gentle on the environment and also more
[SPEAKER_00]: gentle on your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about another thing that I
find to be completely embarrassing about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most wasteful things you could
ever find is cannabis packaging in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a pre-rolled joint,
it comes in a tube that is about six
[SPEAKER_00]: inches long and an inch in diameter and
it's got a label on it from the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a whatever joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you purchase it,
the dispensary is required to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: sticker on it that says that it was grown
at this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rolled at this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sold at this place and it was
bought by this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got to be sold to you in some
sort of a childproof container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that tube isn't already childproof,
they've got to put it in an exit bag or
[SPEAKER_00]: another childproof container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they probably throw that into a brown
paper bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they give you a receipt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they usually give you some sort of a
pamphlet about a new product that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out that you do not care about because you
just bought the product that you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they high-five you and tell you to
have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then most of us get to the car and we
throw away all of that packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we need is that pre-rolled joint that
was in that tube and a lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need any of the other bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every product in Colorado comes with
excessive, ridiculously wasteful
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the concentrate companies will
sell you a gram of concentrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that gram of concentrate will be
inside of a fancy cardboard box with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of fancy labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the top of that cardboard box and
there is a small, like a jewelry pouch,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that a hippie would keep their
little magic rocks in, a little tiny crown
[SPEAKER_00]: royal bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a cardboard box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crack that open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a little crown royal bag in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crack that open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those immediately go in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that crown royal bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that cardboard box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not need that for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now inside is a little glass container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little tiny container that weighs,
I'm gonna drop it on the table so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: hear how heavy these containers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one hash container for one gram
of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that much packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's a gram of hash in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little container would have been
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need all of this packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they put this in a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put stickers on it to show where it
was purchased, who purchased it,
[SPEAKER_00]: what time I purchased it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got a receipt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much bullshit coming along
with this one gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could get a little container and
put it in my pocket and say, thanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need all of the extra shit to
throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the paper trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that Colorado did not require all
of the ridiculous packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be child-proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be ridiculously labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I think that the packages are
only this big so we can fit all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have a small billboard for all
of our requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are creating legislation in your
area, please be mindful of all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging requirements in Colorado and how
embarrassingly wasteful this has become.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just looking at the products on my
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of vape cartridges from
a very well-known company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know whose vape carts I will
smoke and whose I will not consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the requirement of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a vape cartridge, this thing is
probably
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than my pinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is definitely smaller than my
pinky, probably the size of the average
[SPEAKER_00]: person's pinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about a pinky finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging that this comes in is about
the size bigger than a pack of cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit bigger than a pack of
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little tiny thing has got to come in
something about the size of a package of
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you try to open that up, and it's in
a child-proof pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this little press thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to press here, squeeze here,
squeeze here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I usually just end up tearing
the packages apart because that shit only
[SPEAKER_00]: works half the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the inside, there's four or five
things folded together to keep this little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny product in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have done this with very
minimal packaging if Colorado did not
[SPEAKER_00]: require all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, probably this billboard on
the back of the package as part of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all this child-proof and this
over-excessive safety stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of when I was young and I
used to go to the record store and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a cassette or a CD, and you had to
carry that giant contraption up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: front desk so that they could get your CD
out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to put it in that little machine
and try to break it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what it's like when you go
to buy products in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a ridiculous amount of packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Decker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really got off on a ramble there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked what companies should you
support in Colorado that are sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't have any companies
I can point you to directly that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, people are listening to this
episode, and there are people that grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people in facilities that are
going to say, hey, Rasta Jeff,
[SPEAKER_00]: use us as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a shout out, and I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me info that qualifies,
I'll give you a shout out and say that you
[SPEAKER_00]: deserve a fist bump for being sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you ask what techniques I could
recommend for home or commercial use to
[SPEAKER_00]: make us more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you a lot of examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everything I said will apply in a
commercial environment or in a small craft
[SPEAKER_00]: or home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should apply all the way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, pay attention and be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing in your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you saw somebody else doing that,
would you go, oh, man, you're dumb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you go, oh, that's the perfect
way to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch yourself on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch yourself from the third person view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about everything you were doing
in your grow, everything you were doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: your outdoor, in your indoor, in your
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention and think about how you
would react if I told you I was doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was like, hey, bro, today I hung from
a ladder and fucking held onto a light
[SPEAKER_00]: with one hand and applied pesticides
without any personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, bro, what the fuck are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it like you're telling me what
you're doing in your grow and the look I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give you when you tell me about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful marketing idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make some of those plastic,
what would Rasta Jeff do bracelets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe make some, what would Rasta Jeff do
signs?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can hang those up in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll remind you to always be a good
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this episode was short and
sweet, but I got right to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to ramble and try to
extend this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start wrapping up this
episode right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening.

[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

January 25th and 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 25th is industry day, but the 26th is
open to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hope to see you.
