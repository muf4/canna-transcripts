[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I don't want to ramble too much
here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we could talk for a long time
about this topic so let's jump right into
[SPEAKER_00]: this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Patreon, it came from
our friend Luke, and it goes a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I just finished
the podcast, the podcast about backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you do another one on the same
topic, just go a little further,
[SPEAKER_00]: like talking about an RBX1 and keep
crossing it to itself, or better yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it back to its mom, or an RBX1S1
to a P1, or crossing that to an S3 to an
[SPEAKER_00]: S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you just grabbed a bunch of
seed packs and saw those letters on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and just decided to throw a bunch of those
in the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you're saying, I know what
you're asking for, we can delve into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I love the show and all of the
knowledge it brings us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say my name, say my name,
say my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Luke61.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question and for
the continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this on a lot of seed packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a seed maker, seed seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to label my seed packs quite
clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of other seed makers and seed
breeders and seed sellers creating really
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing seed labels and I see a lot of
arbitrary things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to talk a little bit about
some of those letters and labels that we
[SPEAKER_00]: see on our seed packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Luke did ask about some very specific
lettering in here, but I do want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little bit of a foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we learn without a foundation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, we're going to see
things like F1 or F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see the letter F in there,
that means filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, if you see an F,
it is going to be a regular male-female
[SPEAKER_00]: non-feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will not always be the case,
but most of the time, a F1 and F2 will be
[SPEAKER_00]: a regular male-female seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about S1s and R1s in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are also F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in a minute,
but I wanted to just throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: An S1 is also an F1, but an F1 is not
always an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make sense in just a minute,
but I wanted to make sure to put that out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we take two plants, that are
vastly different, and we breed them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, we are now making an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those plants are too close together,
we haven't done our proper breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a whole other podcast conversation
that we could talk about in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love your feedback and input on
talking about the difference in F1s and
[SPEAKER_00]: polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a fun conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, if we see the letter
F, that is indicating filial generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and F1 means it is the first time that
that has been crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat and Daybreaker have been
crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just made a rise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the first filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I were to find a male and a female
from that first batch of seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: we take the Daybreaker and the Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We breed them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grow out those seeds and find an
awesome male and an awesome female and
[SPEAKER_00]: cross those together, we have now made F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are making filial generation number
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we keep repeating that process,
we are moving forward in what is called
[SPEAKER_00]: the filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take the plants that come out of F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find a solid male and a solid female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We breed those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now made the F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat that process all the way up to F6,
and you will make totally completely
[SPEAKER_00]: stable plants that look like clones of
each other if you have done the selection
[SPEAKER_00]: process properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is moving forward in filial
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1, F2, that should make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep going number-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we are pulling from that batch
of seeds and not adulterating and going
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards or bringing in new plants
anywhere, you are moving forward with the
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a male and a female from that
batch, and now you breed them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a male and a female from that
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have made that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about where do we go from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk about back cross in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to take the golden goat and the
daybreaker and breed them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have now made an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to take the male plant,
or we could do the female, but we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to stick with the male for my topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to find a male plant out of that
F1 batch and pollinate the original golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat girl again, that is a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use one of the plants that you used
in the original if you go backwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you cross back to one of the original
parents, you are back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we would do that is to
stabilize and isolate the traits of that
[SPEAKER_00]: original parent plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the focus of the back cross
podcast, so you can listen to that to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn all about back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an F1 is when we make new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: F2, F3 is when we breed that further down
the line with itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not back to another plant, but forward
with itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back cross would be going back to one of
the original parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what generation you're using,
you can always back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do an F3 back to one of the
original parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do an F4 back to the parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would still be a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may label that golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you label it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat to a rise F4 back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you use the F4, you'd want to
indicate that the F4 was used in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just want to know that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it isn't important if you're just
growing this and enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this is important if you're going
to make seeds and sell or share them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're just really trying to
document history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this won't be important to a
smoker or a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't matter to you at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're kind of nerding out and
creating things and wanting to know
[SPEAKER_00]: history and how to make labels and how to
understand the labels better, this would
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've done F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've covered back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about R and S.
[SPEAKER_00]: R and S is when people get confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way for me to explain this is
reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: As when we are making feminized seeds,
we will take a female plant and treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: with the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have reversed that plant to become
a pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to label that plant as a
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to label that plant as a
pollen donor because it is not a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also not a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys talk about feminized seeds
and feminized plants and reversing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: stop saying hermaphrodite because it is
not a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were an intersex plant, I would not
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using a solid female plant that is
treated with a solution to create pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my rant on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay on focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a female plant and treat it
with a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it will create pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen is now feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do with that pollen dictates if I
am creating S or R generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: An R generation would be a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I reverse that plant and put that
pollen on any other cultivar other than
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, we have just made a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about lemon Jeffrey as an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is a reversed golden goat
pollinated a lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a reverse golden goat,
took the pollen, put that on lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The offspring from that is the lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used reversed pollen, put it on a
different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an S1 because it is the first
creation, the first filial generation of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would use R1 to indicate to my
customers, my consumers, the people buying
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds, the people looking at the
website that this is a feminized creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I would go with the R in that
indication to show you it's been reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and it is the first time we have
done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where does the S come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never forget this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds crass, but I promise you'll
never forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: The letter S in that indication stands for
self, which means that plant basically
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked its self.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to take golden goat,
reverse the golden goat, pollinate another
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of the golden goat, we are making
golden goat S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a golden goat self plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else in that golden goat
to adulterate those golden goat genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a golden goat plant, I reversed it,
put another golden goat plant up there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it basically fucked itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds crass, but I promise you're
going to remember that that is a self
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when a plant is flipped,
reversed, pollinated itself and fucks
[SPEAKER_00]: itself and makes seeds of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a feminized golden goat S1,
also an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically when we make feminized seeds,
if it is a reversal, if the pollen from
[SPEAKER_00]: the donor plant is used on any other
plants, that is an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that feminized pollen is put back on
the same plant that it was reversed from
[SPEAKER_00]: the same cultivar, it would be a different
clone, but it's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be an S because it is selfing
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just selfed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either it's been reversed or selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about some of the
details which you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you said P1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You included the letters P1 in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: P1, P means parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So P just stands for parent is what P is
in that equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, can you talk about taking it
further?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like taking an RBX1, which is a reversed
back cross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what is a reversed back
cross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's decipher this code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I'm going to pick a plant to
give an example with this RBX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to pick blueberry cookies
because I work with that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make great reverse results,
great FEM seeds, great outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to explain a little bit about
what this RBX1 is without having the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual seed package in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they did there and I
don't know where you got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to explain this to the
best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good idea who you're reading
these letters from.
[SPEAKER_00]: RBX1, the R indicates that that is a
reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: BX1 indicates that there was a plant that
was selected and bred back to its parent
[SPEAKER_00]: for a desired trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without knowing a little bit more history
of this, I don't know exactly which order
[SPEAKER_00]: it happened, but it sounds like we took a
plant and reversed it and put that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: back on one of its parents is possibly
what happened here because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal, which is an R.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would assume we've got the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treated it with the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant made pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put that pollen back onto one of
its parents would be my assumption here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, without the seed pack, without more
details, without more of the story,
[SPEAKER_00]: all I can do is make assumptions and try
to decipher this code here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But RBX1 would be if you took a plant and
reversed it and put that pollen from that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant back onto one of its parents would
be an easy way to explain that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me try to think of how that would
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would take a blueberry cookies plant
and then we would reverse that and we
[SPEAKER_00]: would pollinate another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter which plant that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say that we pollinated strawberry
fields and we just made the Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got blueberry cookies to
strawberry fields makes Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point, we've got to do a back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to take the Raphael
plant, which is the blueberry cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: the strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to treat that with a solution
which will make that plant make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can take that pollen and put it
back on either the blueberry cookies or
[SPEAKER_00]: the strawberry fields plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could reverse the blueberry cookies or
the strawberry fields and put that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure which order they did it
because I don't have more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that kind of gives me an idea of what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a reversal and something went
back to a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without more of the equation, I can't
really do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's algebra to be done here and I
don't have the other letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so that is RBX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, then you wrote S1 crossed to P1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we selected a keeper from that batch
of feminized seeds and put it back to one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the original parents is what it sounds
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have to be feminized,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're making a reversal,
an S1 that's a feminized project back to
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the original parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a FEM project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of almost, is that an S1?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a back cross right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a feminized back to one of
its parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good way to lock in
certain traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a feminized seed with the
traits that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: cross it back to one of his parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good way to lock in and
isolate traits that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or crossing an S3 to an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing an S3 to an S1 that is the
same line, that is a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing an S3 to an S1 like a self
plant, let's just say that we got a golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: S3.
[SPEAKER_00]: S3 just sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody even does S3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not familiar with anybody that
does an S3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen S2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that Collins go into S3 or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say that we took a golden
goat and selfed it and then that golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat and selfed it and did it again and
did it again to the third generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we just took a different plant
that was an S1 like a lemon skunk S1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed those, you're just making another
F1 that is just another poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be an S1 and F1 or a poly hybrid
probably fit an all of those categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, technically most of these
labels don't really matter unless you are
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder, unless you really want to
know the details about how these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were made, what came from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're that passionate and that curious
about the crosses and the history,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that a little bit of research on
the website of the breeder that made those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will give you a lot of clues of what
they've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the history of a lot of my
crosses and where things have gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just if you looked at like the current
stuff, you could see what's been crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: to add up to what we've got going on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did a little bit of diving,
a little bit of investigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could probably reverse engineer most
of the crosses that you see on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: popular breeders websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I understand where you're getting
these ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Colin at the Ethos Collective at
Ethos Seeds likes to use the R's,
[SPEAKER_00]: the S's, the BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, these labels are kind of
being bastardized and readjusted and
[SPEAKER_00]: reinvented to suit the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really using them the technical
way that they were meant to be done in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't even think that BX is the
correct term.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend F1 Pete, I could see a little
vein in his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: His head tries to rupture every time we
say BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may start adjusting and correcting
that to BC because it is back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I said BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that because when we're listing
crosses, we put the X in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to back cross it,
you just use the X because it stands for
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense, but I honestly don't think
it is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is kind of
bastardized and just created and altered
[SPEAKER_00]: this labeling system to work for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can say though, when we're
listing genetics, this may be kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: side ramp, but this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always list ladies first or pollen donor
first, because sometimes we're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with feminized reverse plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to call that one a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a reversed lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2021, we've got to use the proper
pronoun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a reversal, not a dude,
not a lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not a hermaphrodite,
not intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not a hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermy is not even a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word sounds so third grade to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say herm or intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex is the real word.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chukers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is cutting out really quickly
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, hey, bro, it's time to wrap up
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to listen to my body and quit
rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to think you guys and gals for
listening to another episode of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments or concerns, I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.

patreon.com forward slash grow from your

[SPEAKER_00]: If I said all of that too quickly and you
can't find it, everything you need is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the website at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is all I've got for you
for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to my

give your mom a hug for me.
I'll see you next time.
