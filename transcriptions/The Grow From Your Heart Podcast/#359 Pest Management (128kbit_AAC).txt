[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 359 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of bubble jack full
spectrum extract from Fuego extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor and aroma of this
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like Jack Harrier and bubble
gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dab it, it leaves a sweet soft
bubble gum flavor on your mouth that just
[SPEAKER_00]: lingers for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high goes straight to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I am going to complain about is
the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little plastic jars get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fuego jars get stuck every time I buy
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're putting the jar inside of a
black bag with a drawstring, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: a little tiny crown royal bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jar has stickers on it to indicate the
brand and the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little black bag has a bunch of fibers
that come off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a jar that looks like it's
got long black hairs hanging off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unappealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a waste of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another step in the packaging process
and it is completely useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after they've put the jar in that
bag, they place that bag inside of another
[SPEAKER_00]: box, which slides into another box,
which is all beautifully decorated and
[SPEAKER_00]: well labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a lot of packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most of that packaging is because
of the Colorado compliance laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would like to see less packaging
from the concentrate companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I throw away a lot of
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, so let me be
completely clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubble jack full spectrum extract
tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only complaint is with the packaging
and that is not just Fuego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happen to be using Fuego products
today when I'm talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the companies are using too much
packaging and I understand it's Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish there was a way we could do
this more efficiently and more
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's move forward
with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the seventh lesson in
a long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I want to talk about
planning your integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes to think they will not get
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes to say that's not going to
happen to me, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way you can prevent it is by
starting an integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: system while you're planning your grow,
while you're setting up your grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: having it in place before you ever
introduce plants into your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about
integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the goal of our integrated pest
management system?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ultimate goal is to keep our garden
free of pests and bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good spot to start would be knowing how
to identify the bugs we are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: and the damage that they will leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what insects are we going to find in
our cannabis garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common problem we are going to
find is spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites are very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very unlikely to see a spider mite
unless you flip over a leaf and look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and do some investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you will see is spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a leaf that looks like
somebody has just been taking a needle and
[SPEAKER_00]: poking little dots in that leaf or
something's been sticking its fangs in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and sucking the juice out of those
little spots, that is spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to identify spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see damage on a leaf, pull that
leaf off, flip it upside down and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the underside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the main vein of that leaf,
tucked right up against that vein,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see spider mites and spider mite
eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little dots you see, those are
spider mite eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little itty bitty dots that are
moving, those are the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to treat for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what cycle of growth you are
in, treating for spider mites can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be kind of a pain in the ass
later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you learn how to identify spider mites,
spider mite damage and learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify spider mites, finding the problem
early and correcting it should not be a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem before it gets out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another pest that is very common in the
garden and very easy to identify because
[SPEAKER_00]: of its damage is a thrip.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot like a spider mite, the thrips like
to suck the juice out of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: After they do this, they leave a little
trail of gooey stuff called honeydew on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a little trail of silvery,
shiny, shimmery stuff left on your lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, you probably have thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we become familiar with what thrips
damage looks like, we can identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem sooner and that makes it really
easy to eradicate our problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is, knowing what to look for
will be seriously advantageous when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to treating for a pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common pest you are going to run
into is the white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does a white fly look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little piece of ash just
flying around, just a little white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start off with two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next day you will see 200 of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next day you will see 2,000 of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: White flies multiply rapidly, but once you
see them, they are easy to get rid of if
[SPEAKER_00]: you understand how to combat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very first step of an integrated
pest management system is learning to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the damage caused by common
garden pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we know how to identify the problems,
then we can identify the pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can decide on the course of action
to treat that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it is very important to treat for
the correct pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pesticides will work on a broad
spectrum of pests, but if you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: specific pesticides or if you are using
specific predatory pests, you do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: use the correct method of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's market, we can't afford to
spend money on a product that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically attack our problem,
and also we can't spend time applying a
[SPEAKER_00]: product or releasing predators that are
not going to get in there and eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: our problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn how to identify the signs,
then identify the actual pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can dial in an attack to eradicate
our problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a few ways we can
prepare our grow and prevent pests from
[SPEAKER_00]: entering our new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is a huge factor when it comes
to keeping bugs out of our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that goes in that garden is
taken in there by you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You travel in and out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take things in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility to control what
goes in and out of that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to prevent contaminating your
garden is to have dedicated garden
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come from a hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come from the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go from wherever you are into your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have specific garden clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take your daily clothing into your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what's on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've been petting a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the dog was outside leaning against
the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that tree had aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dog came in, rubbed up against your leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and the dog spent a minute together
scratching on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you went to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just took those aphids from the tree
to the dog into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to prevent that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks down to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrap my dreadlocks up in a specific hat
before I go into any grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got dreadlocks or long hair,
I suggest you put it in a hat of some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort, maybe a hairnet, whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hair would not fit in a hairnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrap my dreads in a big bun on top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrap that in a piece of material that
wraps real tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I slide a dreadlock hat over that so
I'm double wrapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't transfer any problems from grow to
grow or room to room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got dreadlocks or long hair,
I highly recommend you keep it wrapped up
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in a hairnet or something similar,
maybe a dreadhat just where it's contained
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and not exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can prevent moving spider
mites around through your hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys with the big beards,
you may want to consider a beardnet also,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just to prevent the bugs from getting
into our hair, but also to prevent our
[SPEAKER_00]: hair from sticking to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to buy a bud with a big hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your clothes, keep your hair tied
up, and then let's get back to that dog I
[SPEAKER_00]: was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend having pets in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of pictures of people with
their dog or their cat in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it's their guard dog or
their mascot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool if you want to do that,
but I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, your dog or your cat
goes outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rolls around in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rolls around in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what it's getting into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you let it walk right into the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it walked up right up against a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was covered in spider mites and you had
no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that dog is in your garden rubbing up
against your plants, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Free spider mites for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend having a pet in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insist, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, that is a huge risk for
bringing bugs into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I would recommend is that if
you've got an outdoor grow and an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, don't bring your tools from that
outdoor grow into your indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be bringing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I know I sound like I might
just be paranoid, but it's better to be
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoid than to make stupid mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as long as you're changing your
clothes, you're keeping your hair clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're keeping your shoes and your
equipment clean, and you're not letting
[SPEAKER_00]: your dog or your friends in your grow
room, there shouldn't be a way for any
[SPEAKER_00]: pests to get into this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have some cracks in the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be gaps in your building.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always going to happen,
but we're not going to drag them in there
[SPEAKER_00]: on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they find a way in, we will deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you're certain you've minimized
the opportunity for pests to enter your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow through your own doing, we need to
think about treating the clones that come
[SPEAKER_00]: into our grow before they are introduced
to population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever your clones come from,
if it's your best friend, if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, if it's some guy on Instagram,
wherever they came from, treat them as if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are contaminated with some sort of
pest issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never introduce clones into your general
population without some sort of quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room is brand new, you don't have
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why take plants in there that have bugs on
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can treat those plants before we take
them into our main grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a room with plants going,
why would you want to introduce a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with bugs on it into that room to
contaminate the entire grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get clones from anybody,
isolate them, quarantine them,
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate them, get a jeweler's loop and
go over the leaves and see if you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: any signs of bugs on the top or bottoms of
those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any pests, now you have to
decide if you want to keep that clone or
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to treat it and try to
eradicate that problem before you
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce that clone to your general
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got a clone that had bugs on it,
I would probably throw it away unless it
[SPEAKER_00]: were some super elite cut that I could
never get again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why start with problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even allow that to make it past
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looked like it was clean,
I would still probably treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would treat it with whatever pest
management system I have decided to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using sprays and oils, I would
heavily treat it with multiple oils
[SPEAKER_00]: several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably spend a week in
quarantine the first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get blasted with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day three, it would get blasted with
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day five, something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I feel like it's safe and clean,
it may enter general population on day
[SPEAKER_00]: seven or it may get treated one more time,
depending on how it looks to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were working in a facility that did
not use spray applications, I would put
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant in an isolated area with enough
light and living conditions to survive for
[SPEAKER_00]: a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would start heavily applying
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would build up a colony of predators on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they would go through and eat
anything that was causing me a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by day seven, I would be safe to enter
that clone into general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, if I got a clone and it was
contaminated, I probably would just
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't even make it past the
inspection stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't even get into my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, it is your responsibility
to check incoming clones and check them
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly, no matter where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came from your best friend,
if it came from a dispensary, if it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from somebody on the internet,
it is your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot blame anybody for giving you a
clone with bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat any incoming plants as if they
are contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolate them, treat them, and continue to
monitor them until you are certain the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is not there or has been
eradicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another very common way for people to
get garden pests is through store bought
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people try to blame specific
brands for being infested with specific
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand A is made in one area in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand B is probably made in another area
of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brand C will just say that it's
manufactured in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of those brands are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're all shipped to a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these warehouses store their
soil in pallets outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if one of those pallets had a little
bit of bugs in it, they started thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: in that one pallet of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they moved over to the next pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they moved over to the next pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they are in brands A, B, and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way to blame a specific soil
company for giving you bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably the warehouse in which all
of those pallets were stored is where your
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to get away from blaming a
specific brand for having specific bugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unfair and probably inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a fact that our soil does come
with bugs quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll notice this when
you're transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll stick your hand in there and a
little bug will just fly right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a fungus gnat or a white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just fly right up out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to start thinking about how
you are going to treat for those pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times you don't see those soil borne
pests until the first time you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just potted all those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a whole bag worth of soil with the
up pots done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're feeling really good about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the grow room all organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that first batch of water that hits
that soil, you see little bugs come flying
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are fresh bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came fresh with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we know how to identify the
insect and we know how to properly treat
[SPEAKER_00]: for that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treating for soil borne pests is very
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either purchase predator insects
that will get in there and eat that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific pest or we can mix up a root
drench which is a basic pesticide and you
[SPEAKER_00]: mix it with water and then you water that
into the plants just like you would when
[SPEAKER_00]: you normally water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that pesticide gets down in there in
the root zone and then it will eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: any pests that are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things you're most commonly going to
find in soil are going to be white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably find some fungus gnats and
I quite often have found thrips in my
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know that your soil may have bugs
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware, be looking and be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you see some pests, identify
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start thinking about eradication
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan on giving you options for
eradication strategies, but I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are countless options and variables
when it comes to deciding your integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management, but I want to give you
guidance to let you decide and modify your
[SPEAKER_00]: own pest management system to where it
fits with your grow style, with your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and also it's got to fit your
budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you a good guideline
on how to take care of pests in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, but it is up to you to implement
and modify these practices to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've covered most of the
ways that we are going to introduce pests
[SPEAKER_00]: into a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the other ways pests are
going to find their way into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come in through your
venting and your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any spots that are not sealed
up, a spider mite or a little bug could
[SPEAKER_00]: just wiggle its way right through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell that sweet ganja
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to feel that warmth from the
light and it's going to go, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to just go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to tell all of its
friends, Hey bro, I found a way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just going to start parading
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any cracks or gaps in your structure
need to be sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a gap or a crack or a hole
of some sort, put some caulk in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some tape over it, seal it up super
tight so that the bugs cannot get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's ideal to have a completely sealed
room, but I understand that that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: always a viable option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we do have the opportunity to get
bugs in there, our next step is to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to monitor and indicate the presence
of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easiest way and most affordable
and cost-effective way to do that is first
[SPEAKER_00]: by scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to spend time every day looking
through your garden to see if you see any
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of bugs or bug damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scouting for bugs is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes time, depending on the size
of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could take anywhere from five minutes
to a full hour, but it is important work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some good music, get in the zone
and scout for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train everybody in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do identify signs of pests and also
teach them how to identify which pests
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do discover pests, have a way to
mark the plant and also mark on paper
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have row numbers or room
numbers, or if it's just a home grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: just plant number three or the plant in
the middle, just kind of mark down roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: where it is and then start thinking of a
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not the one in charge of pest
management, make sure you report that to
[SPEAKER_00]: the person above you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make a note of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down what you found, what it looks
like, what pest you think it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then start doing research on how do we
eradicate that pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start coming up with options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scouting for bugs is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk the rows, you turn the leaves
upside down, you look, you look low in the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, you look high in the canopy,
you look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to pull a few leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get a good look, reach in
there, pop off a few leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at those underneath your scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you see anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be scouting for pests on a
regular basis with some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you're out scouting for pests,
you should check your yellow sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grow should have yellow sticky cards
and they should be checked frequently and
[SPEAKER_00]: changed frequently as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow sticky cards are exactly what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little yellow cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about four inches by four inches
or maybe four inches by six inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are bright yellow and they are
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a disgusting glue on them that
if you touch it, it's going to take all
[SPEAKER_00]: day to get that stuff off of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get one stuck to your elbow when
you're working in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done it, you know exactly what
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do it, you'll go, ah,
that's what he meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you should have yellow sticky traps
all over the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put yellow sticky traps low down
by the soil so that if I get any soil
[SPEAKER_00]: bound pests coming up out of the dirt,
I get indicators of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put yellow sticky traps low in
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get any low flying stuff,
I get indicators of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put stuff at the top of the canopy
and then I'll also put stuff up near the
[SPEAKER_00]: light so that if anything flies into it,
I get an indicator of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a really easy way to find out
that you have got insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs love those yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, wow, look how bright that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a leaf that is weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a leaf that's got a weak surface
that I can get in there and really start
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking the juice out of without a lot of
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bugs run to that yellow sticky trap
and they go, ah, shit, this is yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stuck here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come in in the morning and we
get to find out what kind of bugs we're
[SPEAKER_00]: messing around in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the garden having a party while
we were at home trying to get some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow sticky traps are really affordable
and they are a really early indicator of
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang up your sticky traps, check them
on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start seeing things stuck to them,
investigate what that pest is and treat
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hang up fresh sticky traps and see if
that problem has gone away or if it has
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten worse or if anything new pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to use the yellow
sticky traps, there has to be some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: method to your madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hang them strategically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to check them and you have to
replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see something, you have to
react accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have two methods of finding bugs
in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use our own vision from scouting
and then we can use yellow sticky traps to
[SPEAKER_00]: assist us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next step is to learn to use our
integrated pest management system to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to prevent infestations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need to learn what to do if a
pest infestation should occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a strategic pest management system,
it's always wise to have preventative
[SPEAKER_00]: measures in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wait until we've got bugs to start
treating for bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it uncomfortable and
undesirable for the pests we know may
[SPEAKER_00]: arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we talk about options,
let's talk a little bit about ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose organic sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose harsh chemical sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you choose to treat your garden
is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to use something safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to your pets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it overall safe to our environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to smoke it yourself,
spray whatever you are comfortable with
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying on your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably don't want to smoke it if you
sprayed it with a few things, but if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: yours and you're sure it's not going
anywhere, you can treat it however you are
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have other consumers that are going
to consume your product, keep their health
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a young, healthy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may have underlying health
issues that may be exacerbated by a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide or an essential oil or a
botanical oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep other people in mind if you are going
to share, sell or dispense your product in
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course, please make sure that your
pest management system is environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to keep in mind the long-term
effects of whatever we choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial mites will have a long-term
environmental effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a much gentler effect than if we
went outside and sprayed harsh chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about long-term, think about
exposure, not just to the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment, the soil, your neighbor's
gardens, but also to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to apply those chemicals or
pesticides or botanical oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about if they're going to harm you
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about, this is something we
don't think about often enough here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm trying to gear myself more toward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the ethics of the company that
makes the products you were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that company care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they care about the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they care about people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they care about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they opposed to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some companies out there that
make products that are available at the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro store that are completely opposed to
cannabis and cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we buy those products to support
those people?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to selecting a pesticide,
understand the company, understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: product you're buying, understand the
active ingredient, and understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of that ingredient in the
long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what it's doing to yourself,
understand what it's doing to your
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, and try to understand what it
does to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really think about if that's
something you can support, if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: something you would be proud to say you
did, if that is something you would stand
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're proud of it, if you can
support it and you'd put your signature on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, go ahead and use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you're comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk a little bit more about
preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was headed with all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preventative measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to start treating for a pest
problem before you see a pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't we go ahead and make an
undesirable environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are easy ways to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: An easy way to do that is to already apply
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not start a colony of beneficial bugs
in our garden before the bad bugs even
[SPEAKER_00]: have a chance to take hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start getting your persimilis,
your swarskies, whatever you decide to use
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little bit of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you order the proper bugs
that work for your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your temperature and humidity will play a
huge factor in the bugs that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get some predators in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the army established and get them
started before the bad guys can even get
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another route you can take is by
spraying pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your essential oils,
your botanical oils, or you can use your
[SPEAKER_00]: light or heavy chemical sprays,
whatever you choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start applying them before you see
an insect infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if a bug does try to creep down
the ducting, it jumps on the plant and it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes, oh, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just tries to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't invite its friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create that undesirable
environment before you even get an
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start with a schedule and a
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide that you're going to spray every so
often and then decide that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate your products this frequently and
then set a schedule and a routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you see anything, you can step
up your game accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about scheduling and
strategy a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say we have been scouting and we
have been doing our preventative sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: and now we have discovered some pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do we treat them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the first step?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step is to correctly identify
your pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a commercial scale, it would save a lot
of time and energy to treat for the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct pest the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is to correctly identify
our pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to think about how do we
want to treat this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to use predators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to use horticultural oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to use botanical sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to get in there with essential
oils or do we want to step up our game and
[SPEAKER_00]: start using light pesticides or maybe even
stronger pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we have to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the essential oils and the hippie
products aren't going to get rid of a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you'll need to step up to a
mild pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the pesticides are organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a serious infestation and
you don't want to deal with some organic
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you can step your way up to more
harsh chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, those are toxic and they
become dangerous and you need to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the ethics of what you are giving to
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're trying to stay more
organic, if you're doing a TLO sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, you can introduce predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predators are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to have specific insects to
battle specific insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just release one thing and
expect it to go take care of any bug that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predators are an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get out there and let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They either come in sachets or they come
in a bottle with like a little spout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to let them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow they have to be dispersed through
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are time consuming, but they are
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are 100% organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not applying anything to the garden
that's going to change the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not putting any chemicals on there
that may make anybody else sick and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are completely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you found a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You identified the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done some research on products that
will help you get rid of that pest to
[SPEAKER_00]: either beneficial bugs or pesticide
sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've decided to apply that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind, if we apply the same
product to a pest too many times,
[SPEAKER_00]: those bugs will develop a resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll spray for that bug again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll think it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of weeks later, it'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll spray twice as hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back and it won't show up for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it does come back, you won't be able
to spray it down with the product you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been using before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to prevent that, I recommend using
multiple modes of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget that if the pesticides
work together and don't cause a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: problem together and don't disrupt the
plant health, you can mix more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide and a tank together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an episode about it titled Tank
Mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to mix multiple products
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mix your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give it a good shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You apply to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say give it two or three days,
then apply a different mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you still see the presence of
bugs, apply a different mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go at it with the same product over
and over because they will develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, I said we would talk about
scheduling and strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a more scheduled and
detailed integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a quick rundown of my scheduling
and my strategy for pest management in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everything I mentioned is approved by
the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: Division and also the Colorado Department
of Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot apply a pesticide that is on the
banned list or that has not been approved
[SPEAKER_00]: for use in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I'm using is approved by the
state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to start my pest management system,
every Monday I apply a specific pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen to all of my vegetative plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My small veg, my large veg, my mother
plants, and the clones that are rooted and
[SPEAKER_00]: in pots, they all get sprayed with a
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of the plant,
I may spray them with a little more potent
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may spray them with a lighter mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may spray with just one product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may mix up multiple products at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every Monday, those plants are getting
treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also write down exactly what I sprayed
on each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, next week, I know I can switch
my pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can spray something different next week
to prevent a resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that my plants have got a
protective barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little protection going on to
prevent from getting pests in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using lighter sprays,
if you're using botanical oils or
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils, you may want to up your
spray regimen to twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those things don't stick around very
long, you may want to apply them more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a weekly spray schedule in place
and try to switch up your products so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can prevent your pests from building
any type of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're in there applying the
sprays, spray the undersides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the spider mites are on the
underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not spray there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So start at the bottom of the plant and
start spraying the underside of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: and work your way up the plant to the top
and you will saturate the entire grow this
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to cover all of the plants just to the
point of runoff, right to when they start
[SPEAKER_00]: dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific products will have specific
guidelines, but I recommend you spray
[SPEAKER_00]: right to where they start running off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to saturate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave any desirable space for a
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and spray once,
maybe twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do this throughout the
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we start approaching the flower
phase, we need to think about what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do for pest management during the
bloom phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a typical commercial grow, I would
generally apply approved pesticides until
[SPEAKER_00]: day 14 or 15 of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go in there the first day of the
third week and hit that room one last time
[SPEAKER_00]: if I've had any problems, just to make
sure those bugs aren't coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have any buds building yet,
if you're just starting to get buds set,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be OK with one final spray if
you were selective with your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you haven't seen any bugs,
you can taper off your spray applications
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we can start to introduce
our beneficial and predator insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the beneficial insects work just like
pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to reapply them at specified
intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the vendors that provide live bugs
are willing to set you up on a schedule to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you will receive the same order
every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can rely on it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show up at the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, hey, look, they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to hang them because
they're right there in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to get yourself on a
good regimen and a good schedule of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the live bugs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a commercial grow, we basically work
with spray applications until we see bud
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we switch to the predator
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to taper off your spray
application to where it doesn't destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: your predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've been releasing your
predators on your schedule and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing spider mites, you can order fast
release predators that will get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and eat those spider mites for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a bottle with a little spout
and they are hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn the spout, you open that bottle,
you point that bottle at a leaf and the
[SPEAKER_00]: spider might the predator mites that are
in there start marching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go and destroy the spider mite
colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start seeing an infestation
during flower and you're already putting
[SPEAKER_00]: out the bugs, you just need to step up the
bugs and try to write it out through
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can defoliate, take any spider mite
infested leaves out of there, get them out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go into a different room after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drag the bugs from the dirty room to
the clean room on your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to start the day working in the clean
room and then work your way through to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirtiest rooms and try to work on the bug
infested room very last if that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've done everything correctly,
you won't see spider mites lay in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you do and you're using beneficial
insects, you've got the option to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: more beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend spraying flowering
plants with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have bud set, everything you
spray on there, you will taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not in the flower, you will taste it in
the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do notice a presence of bugs lay
in flower in your flowering room and you
[SPEAKER_00]: were using beneficial insects,
as your pest management system,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're using sprays as your pest
management system, it is time to step your
[SPEAKER_00]: game up in your vegetative areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to eliminate the pests in veg
because if you've got them in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are in veg and we need to start
getting rid of them and having a clean
[SPEAKER_00]: grow before we move stuff into the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I've mentioned, once we get
past week three, we can't really spray
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only treat them with bugs and that
takes time to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus on getting the plants clean
and pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we even move them to that stage,
a lot of people try to focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get those pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are on their way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on the moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go all the way to the beginning and
get the mother plants very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the source material clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work on keeping the clones clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn how to get the veg room
immaculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, when we move into the flower
room, we don't have to battle bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to battle pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can focus on building those fat,
juicy buds and delicious trichomes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I do recommend is write
down all of your sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working in a commercial grow,
you were required to write down all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write down the date,
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to write down the name of
every product and the EPA number of every
[SPEAKER_00]: product and the amount of every product
that you applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write down the REI of each
product that you applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write down the lot number of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of documenting to be done in
a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you do the same thing in your
private grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for peace of mind, it's always nice
to have records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do end up working in a
commercial grow, you've already got
[SPEAKER_00]: experience writing down what you've been
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm sure there are a lot of people
that will not agree with my pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: spray application regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that people have different
opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the method that I use in a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what has been proven to work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been proven to be cost effective
and it is something that I can train other
[SPEAKER_00]: employees to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all other aspects of growing
cannabis, the options for integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management are endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as it's making you happy,
as long as you are satisfied with the
[SPEAKER_00]: results, keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, Podcast World, that is my quick
talk on integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I didn't recommend any products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't recommend any specific vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not recommend any brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to give you an idea of how to
start your own custom tailored integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know what to expect and you've got
a few options on how to prevent and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can customize that program to work
for your grow, your budget and your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any questions or comments
