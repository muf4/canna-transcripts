[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 149 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you once again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band for letting me use their music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope everybody's having a great
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're smoking a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got the e-nail turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're smoking some good shatter,
maybe some good live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're smoking some rosin with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're smoking, I hope you're
getting high as shit and having a good
[SPEAKER_01]: time with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode
features our good friends White Mike and
[SPEAKER_01]: also Jesse Groes is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about a little bit of outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about a whole bunch of randomness.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really wonderful episode in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I did drop a Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't catch the episode that came
out on Thursday, make sure you go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: check that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 148 is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out Thursday.

[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the music for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to bust a freestyle?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you're about to let one go.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear a freestyle rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear the White Mike freestyle
rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a White Mike freestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trap rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you register to vote city
council.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slang it in Texans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have press record, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are recording at this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to
episode number 149.
[SPEAKER_01]: As promised, sitting to the left,

[SPEAKER_01]: a returning champion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
podcast, our good buddy, Jesse Groves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, Jesse showed up with raw turps
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's locked and loaded and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, thanks for showing up ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to use your microphone voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I interrupted him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was about to take a drink of that
Prosticle Lou beer, and I started talking
[SPEAKER_01]: to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cotton mouth killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of cotton mouth, we were taking
some serious dabs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, Jesse, before we get too far,
tell everybody on social media how they
[SPEAKER_01]: can stalk you while they listen to your
sexy voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, Jesse Groves, and then also you
can check out my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a Facebook page, Colorado Dope
podcast on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colorado Dope podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys make sure you check that out,
support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big shout out to Mick the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, Mick the dog will be
joining us also on this podcast right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's taking a comfy seat underneath the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a regular listener, you know,
the other day I kicked the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not mean to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, thanks for joining us everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow at Jesse grows on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a look at his photography while
you're listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk a whole lot about
outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys also across the table from me,
another repeat offender, a returning
[SPEAKER_01]: champion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that was here just last night
recording a show with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: White Mike is on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not a regular listener,
you can check Mike out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter and he is
also Pueblo 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out that group page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to train that in my
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of words for my stoner brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on
social media in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remembering someone else's thanks,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for doing that for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you on the last episode,
we need you out there fighting that part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse will do the growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get us legal fight for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate having you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking time away from the baby,
the family, the dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a busy dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were supposed to trim all night,
so I'm glad that you ended up not
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming.
I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up trimming all night and then
that got waved off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, back for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping to be here with Jesse
finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a first.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we've done celebratories, haven't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like 50 and 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're both here for those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we did one before too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met you at this table doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed that memory away completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to remember some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early, early episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're foggy in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: People remind me of things I've said and
done on those episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, wow, that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to burst the balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been toting around all day,
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, this is the first meaningful
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first grow oriented one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 149, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: 149 episodes into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't missed a week in two and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every Monday you guys have had a podcast
to listen to and some Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been running 20 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow will be your 20th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was honored to be on one of those
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we did a, I call it a swap cast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned the phrase swap cast from Doug
Stanhope, but it's when two podcasters
[SPEAKER_01]: come together and record one podcast and
then they both put it up on their feed so
[SPEAKER_01]: that everybody gets exposed to both shows
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did one of those with the Colorado
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of chaos, but it is a
great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to it on their feed so that they
get the clicks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Page and listen to that episode on their
feed because they could use the traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some internet problems or some
website problems at the moment,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I'm not sure they'd be able to find
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tech difficulties, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this episode won't come out for a
few days, so hopefully you've got that
[SPEAKER_01]: resolved by then, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully your tech guy is on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I know a guy that'll work on that
one for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say I'm excited because
episode 150, it has been confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 150 is going to feature the dab
and granny once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I recorded the episode before I'm a
little heartbroken that it failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has been real supportive and
encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's all about coming back and
re-recording that podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab and granny went and bought special
hash to smoke with me to show me that she
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mind doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow night at a secret location,
I will be recording with the dab and
[SPEAKER_01]: granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it'll be at the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this goes out, it'll be too
late for anyone to show up and harass us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but tomorrow night at the Canna Canyon,
it'll be myself, Dab and granny,
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett from Evo Labs, and Lindsay,
the traveling stoner, and probably Bobo
[SPEAKER_01]: Blaster Co will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully Miss Camille will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully Erin will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully Bitty and Sirius will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to try to mimic the
show we did last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit to try to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be things that get left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to have a conversation
like we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that is lost forever unless you
find it on dab and granny social feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dab and granny's first podcast and
she wasn't sure how to go about it right
[SPEAKER_01]: away, so now she is completely fucking
comfortable and she knows what to do on a
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a practice run, you guys,
but 150 will be the dab and granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a cool way for karma to
land on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a bad deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about outdoor growing,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about these dabs as
distillate and these turps though,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You showed up with some delicious shit,
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remind me what's in each of these little
vials you got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got critical mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Critical mass turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raw distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the OVM.
[SPEAKER_01]: OVM orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vanilla Milano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Vanilla Milano.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the garden of Weeden for an
amazing breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his first run chucking pollen and
those fucking that strain came out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I could tell him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had 12 females of it, so I don't know
how much he's grown it out, but I could
[SPEAKER_02]: tell him a little about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could use a pack of those, Spence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could use some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what's this last one here?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla Glue Raw Turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, they have figured out how to
take a plant, a cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably takes more than one plant,
but take a large batch of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: extract the turpinoids from that specific
batch, that one plant, and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get the essence, the flavor, the aroma,
the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it all in your face and all in
your palette just with one little droplet
[SPEAKER_01]: on a dab and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can actually be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've learned that some require far,
far less than a droplet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Durbin poison dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I overdone it on some that I took the
other night and it was just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that was way too much Durbin
poison on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This glue was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think the turpenes are really
contributing to my high also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me skyrocket to that next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became crystal clear when I started
playing with the distillate and the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking the same THC material and
when you add it to something like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Critical Mass, you go one way hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add it to something like the
Durbin, you go the other way, real hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not changing the THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the other parts of the plant that
really shape that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entourage effect, the synergistic
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: What Gupta talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's exactly evident.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we're using the turps like this,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know your company is experimenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give your company a shout out so that we
can hype them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Uncle Bud company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Uncle Bud company based in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we were pulling raw turps out
here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: With no THC in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero THC in these turpenoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab proven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these, it would not be, hypothetically,
I'm not going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypothetically, we could make these
available nationwide because there are no
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diverting it out of metric is a whole
nother story, but making them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's virtually impossible for that to
leave the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracking System.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as a consumer, if you purchase it in
a store, if there's no THC in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: can it travel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was also my assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's nothing, that's
turpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpenoids are not illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a little glass vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend a lot of time
explaining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just smells like weed, officer,
stop hating me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to Vitamin Cottage, get yourself
some fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Theoretically, it's also legal to ship in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, theoretically, since it's just
turpenoids, I mean, you can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: turpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vials of liquid in the mail, that's the
thing they're big on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, theoretically,
I'm not going to try it, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't, folks, but if there's really
no THC in it, I think there's a loop here
[SPEAKER_00]: to be played with if necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a, whoa, my mic got too
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a website called JustTurps.com or
something similar to that where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase turpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy all of the turpenoids
separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the big pretty wheel I've seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those turps are not derived from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are pulled from things like bananas
and roses and oranges and other fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that are not able to smoke this
quality cannabis would be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have to get some dabs or some
distillate or something to carry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably put this in at like a
vape pen cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix that up with some VG,
some vegetable glycol or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: All day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: All day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes vaping a little less gay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to go there about it,
but yeah, you can put that in a vape pen
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you can actually taste Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could taste this OVM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could taste the Critical Mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could taste, I've got Ghost Train Haze
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Lemon G, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do crazy shit for me for the Lemon
G.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll stare at you like, can I get one
of them Lemon G dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like they got them white lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here for the Friday 5 o'clock free
Lemon G dab giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: They got VCRs and shit in their hand for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about the Lemon G turps are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had OG Kush turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Paradigym turps floating around
here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so delicious to taste these cannabis
turpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting spoiled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually, it's really not that hard
to extract them either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the right equipment and the
right knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, tell us what you feel
comfortable sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to pry too much information
out of you, but if there's something you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to tell us that we would love to know
some of your process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get with me and give me a hundred
bucks, I'll walk you through the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can even, I've already proven I can do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I taught Rastaseb how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred is not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes an investment in equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much would the equipment cost for a
small operation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I had five pounds of plant
material to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much equipment should I buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would I be spending for a five pound
run?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking about 600 bucks and you're
going to be doing five runs instead of one
[SPEAKER_02]: five pound run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about a pound at a time and it's 600
bucks in equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go to the store?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do it on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got the hundred bucks so that you
could teach me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's next week's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to order a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next episode, you're going to come
back and I'm going to just be sitting here
[SPEAKER_01]: covered in turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spilled some and I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a solventless process, completely and
totally organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a little bit of a chemistry
background or you just need to know
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who can walk you through the
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already been taught it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between you and Brett Maverick,
I should be able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Brett Maverick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I taught Seb how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Ross to Seb also,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm ready to answer your
Facebook messages yet, bro, but shout out
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No dude, I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not ready to interact yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought Jesse on the show because Jesse
is my outdoor expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of pressure on you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: My outdoor expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means I don't know a lot of outdoor
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the previous outdoor grow episodes that
Jesse's done with you have been some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were you at home, I'd get a
notepad and a pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Randall Jr. Get out a notepad and a
pen, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're taking notes right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put down the Pokemon Go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to take some notes about the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Charizard can wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Randall, we love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are probably about three weeks
into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should start seeing the pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Calyx pistols are starting to form on
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those little, you guys call them hairs,
the white hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are popping up on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got girls, those are popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something super important and hyper
critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your boy plants need to be fucking pulled
by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk through your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of that shit because how far can
pollen travel?
[SPEAKER_01]: At least four miles or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't want everybody's crop
getting pollinated because you're Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just let out a full solid burp on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need everybody's crop getting
pollinated because you're too lazy to pull
[SPEAKER_01]: a male plant out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go outside, pull the male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already done it,
you might be fucking up already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about it on another episode of
how quickly male plants drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a male plant in another room
right over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is like 15 days in and he is just
blasting pollen right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it only takes 15 or 16 days for serious
trouble to start happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't take long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually I've known an amateur
breeder that pollinated his neighbor's
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that was let's say 400, 500 feet
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: With with trees, fences, houses,
all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, pollen is amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's its whole purpose of life is to
just land on a female plant and climb up
[SPEAKER_01]: that pistol and get up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wants to get in the ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of places that have
passed special rules keeping hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana grows like five or six miles
away just to make sure that there's never
[SPEAKER_00]: a legal war between like the big hemp
field and the big marijuana field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally know a solution to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would I would grow my sense of Amelia
grow right next to a hemp field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you willing to expose your secret on
the podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know you told me the way you
told me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you tell us on the show or do you
want to keep that a secret?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp plants only pollinate once a year or
they only release pollen once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plan your your your bloom cycles
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Accordingly, if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also most hemp growers like to grow
from clout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's significant other ways you
can protect your own grow from the next
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy next door who doesn't know the
difference between a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to it's part of the planning
and the research you should have done by
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or he should have done.
[SPEAKER_01]: He should not have a male out there
outside in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually know a couple of breeders in
California that do everything outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just shake my heads at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be doing that, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should be getting buds right about
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll start seeing the bud sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to get in there and kind of take
off that lower shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screwed him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shave the legs in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys get in there and clean off all
the lower canopy where the air is not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting in something where like a little
squirrel could get help climbing up the
[SPEAKER_01]: little ladder at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that off of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff that's going to hang down
and touch the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those little sucker branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little thin pale yellow branches
that are just shooting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take all those off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go clean up the inside a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to focus on the tops of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where all the magic is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clean them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hollow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hollow them out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull them apart and spread them if you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to get a giant stick and stick
it in the dirt and pull one branch this
[SPEAKER_01]: way and one branch this way so that
they're getting sun properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could take a beating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go out into your grow around noon one o
'clock when the sun's really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sky and everything that's not
getting direct sunlight right then and
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's that kind of use that as a
guide of what to take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's you know I mean not everything's
going to be getting full sunlight but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know things that are just in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know at the bottom you know you can
take that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that are you know a little further
down the side or bud sites that are
[SPEAKER_02]: further down the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not be getting full sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're still getting sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave those there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know just judge accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all that all that dark stuff you
definitely take that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be larpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to turn that unless you're
making a bunch of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I mean maybe leave that if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to take away from the
energy up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stretch phase should be just about
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the first three weeks we really
start stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be slowing down now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see kind of how big our plants
are actually going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of get a judgment of how tall they're
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much panicking you need to do on
readjusting that fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people I know I know
people that are in that second trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well people are growing crazy outdoor
plants here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's completely illegal to grow
outside in Pueblo Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just building a higher fence every
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see them like had to put more plywood
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spotted another one today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an old school giant back TV set
propped against a gate on the outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the target place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I about died laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that time of year you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be all over Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys if you're growing outdoors this
year and someone tries to steal your shit
[SPEAKER_01]: don't fucking shoot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow more weed next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that we have to do this episode
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happened here though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody got shot trying to steal
somebody's cannabis outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that medicine that was supposed to be
medicine became a target of theft which
[SPEAKER_01]: became an attempted homicide which fucked
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that vibe attached to this
plant at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we tried to make it legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we wanted it safely accessible
so nobody's getting shot over this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took it away from the cartels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in the hands of the medical
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it right you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not justifiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It instantly makes it into a criminal
element or criminal enterprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're protecting your illegal crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't shoot anybody please you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this you're
probably not going to shoot anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all peaceful cool ass people is why
you're listening to my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stretch phase is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to start seeing what size of
plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't top anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the next things I had
written down is no more topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hormones in the plants have all
decided where the tops of those plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they need to bank the most energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they need to send the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they need to send all the energy for
budding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit topping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of bend them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stretch them down but don't cut
anymore off the tops of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take all that bottom shit freely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the tops where the hormones have
climbed up don't take that off of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it time now to adjust the nutrients
that we're feeding them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably you know especially by the time
this comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah last week most definitely now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put this out Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor plants they'll use a little more
nitrogen than indoor plants will through
[SPEAKER_02]: the bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know keep that bottle of bloom or I
mean bottle of grow around.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I do it is I'd probably just if I
felt they need a little extra nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: shot I just mix up some some grow and
maybe a little cow mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And feed that in addition to the normal
feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so add it on top of what you're
normally feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I saw Subcool take a bottle of
nutrients and pour it directly onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil on his outdoor grow and then just
watered it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't recommend that but I saw that
shit and it made me shake my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Subcool really did that bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of the most reputable growers you
could find on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dude just poured a bottle of a
nutrient I won't even use straight onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the dirt and then watered it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Subcool's kind of from the south
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got that southern flavor to him so he
doesn't give two shits most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hold my tongue on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah all right let's move on from Subcool
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's time to adjust the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse made a really good point that I
didn't think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: These outdoor plants are gonna use a
little more nitrogen than what we're used
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So increase your nitrogen feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not gonna be a bottle fed
nutrient kind of guy what kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: can we add to top dress to get a little
more nitrogen in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah now we're talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right up your alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Neem Mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sea Bird Guano is a great all-purpose
guano if that's your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've quit using it but I had a shit ton of
it so it's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta use it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not gonna buy anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Sea Bird Guano gives you PK and
nitrogen so it's a real good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about whatever they're
eating the fish and the kelp that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think that really adds to the
flavor and the funky smell of good cushy
[SPEAKER_01]: bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think kelp and Sea Bird Guano really
contribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love ocean products make the best
tasting bud in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done veganic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done the bone mills and blood mills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my little ocean style kelp and crab
shell mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sea Bird Guano works good with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the product SeaPlex from
Organicare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cold pressed blue algae based
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it makes the buds taste better,
smell better, they get more density and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's something else in there that
just makes them grow better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever is happening in that kelp,
that life that's in that kelp makes my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely gives them a little boost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelp's the fastest growing plant on the
face of the planet so there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: natural PGRs going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this stuff is not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelp is also a great bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take kelp, put it in a court mason
jar, put a cup of kelp in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: go ahead and top it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Off with water, let it rehydrate for 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strain any extra water away if there is a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Run that kelp through your food processor
and that'll turn it into just a mush.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, it dissolves into water and
you can foliar spray it as a bloom booster
[SPEAKER_02]: right there on your plant and then store
it in your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the back, keep it as cold as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll definitely make your plants happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you add any fulvic acid to that
spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: That wouldn't hurt a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it a little more absorbable?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the recipe to a lot of
organic gluten boosters on the market
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any foliar that you're spraying has got
kelp in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there sisilic acid naturally in kelp
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that where the sisilic acid comes in?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit but most of that or
the big source of that is aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really popular right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could easily add some aloe vera into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I actually going to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just made a new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fucking pad this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have no pads.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to write that down?
[SPEAKER_01]: That went up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That went into my grower brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in my grower brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, back in the day, we were taught not
to take too many notes because if your
[SPEAKER_01]: door got kicked in and there were notes
that said, feed on week six, feed on week
[SPEAKER_01]: seven, you just left a paper trail in your
handwriting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to have those plants in there with
no fucking notes and a good memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was harder at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things change in legalization and
that's just one of the really nice ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that not everyone even gets to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I was scared to look at it on the
internet even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even to Google or back then it was like
Yahoo or American Online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you part of overgrow.com?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was way too scared to ever ask questions
or post on it but I totally read the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking gold and looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go look and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to make up fake accounts on other
sites and just go look like that before I
[SPEAKER_02]: was supposed to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Culture magazine had a really
good one too after they shut down
[SPEAKER_02]: overgrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the people from there went.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got into the forums years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got my med card, I was like,
fuck this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I had my med card, it was game the
fuck on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people may argue with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the OG Kush, the OG and OG
Kush could be OG from overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you met somebody from overgrow,
they'd just say, hey, are you fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse from OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you wouldn't want to say overgrow
because if it wasn't you, then I just
[SPEAKER_01]: fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, from what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevermind man, from this thing I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just called it OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys all on OG or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that people were shipping seeds
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: One guy had a seed and he shipped some of
them to Jesse and then Jesse grew them and
[SPEAKER_01]: found the phenotype he liked and bred to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then shipped those seeds to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that somebody ended up with a bag
of seeds and they call it the overgrow
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be completely fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many stories of where the OG
Kush came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the more plausible ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of an adaptation of another
one I've heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one and then the one that involves
the Bubba Kush guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt from Florida coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of falls in there, but that's the
two items.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to believe personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of other stories of how
that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even bring up the podcasts that
I've heard them on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having the OGs I have, I love OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love some good OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Jeff's OG has got some flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be some Jeff's OG available on
the shelf at the store pretty soon here
[SPEAKER_01]: that John Randall Jr. trimmed up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're top dressing with nitrogen heavy
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some- Add them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, add them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, but don't go too hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you want to hit hard with your P's
and K's.
[SPEAKER_02]: P's and K's now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, it takes a week to two weeks on
a typical top dress for it to break down
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to be uptakeable by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it right now or in the morning,
whatever it is, that's not going to really
[SPEAKER_02]: take effect for at least a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that plant is already yellowing,
you're chasing it by now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have done more nitrogen
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year, do more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still add nitrogen to keep it from
getting worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll help your buds develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll keep everything moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other top dresses though, neem mill is a
favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crab mill is good for blooming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then kelp, most organic bloom boosters are
made out of kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mess with the caranja meal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the neem mill mix I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 50-50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem and caranja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll keep most bugs out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll keep most bugs out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never notice it when in the
finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about defoliating because at
this point of the season, it's time to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean up a bunch of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like to heavily defoliate or do you
just clean them up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more of a cleanup guy on outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get in there and clean them the fuck up
on an indoor garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take off a lot of leaves to where
people look at you like you're crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they come back a week,
10 days later and all the leaves are back
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can't even tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try it on this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got three of the same strains planted
in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one in the middle, they're all about
the same size.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in the middle is going to get
tortured?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What strain do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old school Northern Lights number
five?
[SPEAKER_02]: The cut that goes around Denver shops
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the one that Spence bred to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the cut I made my Grape OG with
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes some donkey dicks for buds for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes some huge, huge fucking buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So defoliate, you guys clean up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically any leaf that looks like it's
going to be blocking a bud site from
[SPEAKER_01]: getting sunlight, just go ahead and pull
that fucker off and it's going to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: back because it's an outdoor plant and
you're going to be amazed at how quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves grow back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll pull off a leaf the size of your
hand and in 10 days you'll have one back
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger than your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about feeding a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a little bit about top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about defoliating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned specifically that we need to
talk about caterpillar prevention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the time it happens every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we do to get rid of caterpillars?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've already got full grown
caterpillars inside your fully developed
[SPEAKER_02]: buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing you can do aside from just
manually picking through and pulling them
[SPEAKER_02]: out yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time to apply those
preventative things that will keep them
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have to spray your bud
sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spraying your, sorry, I just heard voices
in my head jump or the volume in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just turning you up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting far from the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to fix it, but you fixed
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need some bud site for that BT to be
on to ward off the parent from laying the
[SPEAKER_02]: egg in there in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So BT is what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Captain Jack's Monterey spray.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacillus Thuracida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacillus Thurigensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think I should Google that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll Google that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I recommend for for getting
rid of any kind of bud warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now's the time to apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also the garlic oil ferment that you
were talking about is very good for that
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even just essential garlic oil from the
health food store would probably have some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the same properties in it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Bacillus Thurigensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's, that's available from
Captain Jack's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available at Monterey spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very popular product used for
keeping away insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mosquito dunks that you buy at
whatever Lowe's or Home Depot,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the main ingredient in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can crush those up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put that in some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can water that directly into your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will get rid of your fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll get rid of most soil bound
creatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actinovate is a, is another brand name.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a dry powdered product,
but it's, it's same active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural has the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you're going to use any of
these powdered products beyond the dunks,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dunks are just fine probably to use
without a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use natural or
Actinovate, please wear a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research everything before use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get a new pesticide, if you take
that little booklet that's on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That little booklet, if you open it up,
it tells you all the safety precautions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you how much to apply on certain
types of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you how long between
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you what kind of safety equipment
you need to wear.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of weather you need to apply it
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's going to rain and you
apply certain things, it's just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: wash right off and you just wasted that
whole application time and the expense on
[SPEAKER_01]: the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in there, it tells you the re-entry
interval.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long from spring this product should
you avoid this room without wearing
[SPEAKER_01]: protective gear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of the chemicals and products
that are available at your hydro store are
[SPEAKER_01]: much more toxic and dangerous than you
realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: They expect you to be a responsible adult
that can read that label.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bear stuff, the bear spray they sell
for your outdoor house at Lowe's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can completely kill a human if you
fuck around and do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to the labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys read that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the safety sheets in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I sound like I'm preaching to you,
but a lot of the things that you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: from these products, you won't notice
until 10 or 12 years down the line,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll start getting a facial tick or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be from that time you sprayed
fluoromite into the fan and it came back
[SPEAKER_01]: into your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they affect you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most nervous system and
reproductive system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the exact same thing they do to the
insects they're intended to kill.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just going to take a little
while longer on you because you're fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: 160 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so caterpillar prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use that bacillus thurigensis spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available in Captain Jack's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monterey Insect Spray has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, a very good recommendation for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't sponsor me in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company called Arbico.com,
A-R-B-I-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell all types of horticultural
supply, gardening supply type stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy almost any type of sprays you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy organic sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell anything from stylet oil to
fluoromite in this one catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also sell beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something I was going to talk
about in a future episode with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's jump into it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects is now the time to
release a whole bunch of beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that'd be totally cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predator mites and ladybugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lacewigs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go for ladybug larvae, especially
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The larvae are a lot more productive,
meaning they eat more shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, because they're still growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll hang around longer too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the trick to keeping ladybugs to
stick around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a trick to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some pretty awful things.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, outdoors is where I use them most
and just having a nice welcoming
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not normally many pests on the
plants, but there can be pests found in
[SPEAKER_02]: the mulches and the garden beds around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that works to keep them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick around there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about a praying mantis?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a shit ton of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arbico.com happens to sell praying mantis
larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order them, set the larvae on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will hatch and come alive in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it happen, but I've seen
videos of it because I'm kind of an
[SPEAKER_01]: internet nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That company does not pay me anything,
but they've got all of the products that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a preventative to keep the
bugs away, if you want something a little
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger to destroy them, or if you want
to go full fucking madness nuclear,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got the product for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll ship it to you quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use that catalog all the time just for
plenty of research to compare things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this versus this, which is better?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just hold the pages side by side and
see what you like better and read them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got everything in there,
but again, if you get some fluoromide,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you get something crazy, get yourself a
Tyvek suit and some gloves, a mask,
[SPEAKER_01]: suit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go all Walter White style in that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think you're a bastard for spraying
that shit outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever spray it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't kill bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit wipes eyes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the bees, you don't have any food,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I eat grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I eat either grows or eats
something that grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your food eats my food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be a pretty shooty place without
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want beneficial predators, predatory
mites is what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want some of the praying mantises.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the kind of bugs can we put out
there to help us out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put worms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a spider good luck in your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a good thing to have one or two
spiders?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll eat most of the other bugs,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a wasp?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got those too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to cause any problems,
are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually watched the wasps carry away
a full grown bud worm before.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Colorado, we get something that I
don't know if these happen anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael remember these.
[SPEAKER_01]: My microphone cover is bright orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get these orange bud worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've called them melon worms before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get those in your buds around here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like a brownish green color,
but they're all beetles of some kind,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the orange ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the Captain Jax and the Monterey spray
going to keep that shit away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects them all equally.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, if you got something
really exotic and crazy, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know here in Southern Colorado,
it takes care of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody is local, if they're here in
the Pueblo, Colorado area, where can they
[SPEAKER_01]: go pick up some good sprays to take care
of their insects?
[SPEAKER_01]: One Love Garden Supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I can remember the address.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 116 East 4th Street, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 618.
[SPEAKER_01]: 618.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the right numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dyslexic or some shit on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: 618 East 4th Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go support One Love Garden Supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go say hi to my beautiful wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go support that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go support local businesses if you can,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for like 40 minutes
talking about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have any outdoor grow
questions that you would like me to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, send them to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will compile the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take screenshots into my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them all in one little section,
and then I'll get Jesse back over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we will address your questions
specifically so that we can help you out
[SPEAKER_01]: with exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of dial it in and aim it a little
more at you specifically and get what you
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other quick thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are going to start using more
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just give them what they'll take and
what they need to stay perked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want big fat buds, you got to get
them lots of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that mainly applies to in-ground
plants, but same for a potted container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it'll only take so much water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as it dries, give it some
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sleep in and think you can water
those plants later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get out there and water them
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not willing to stay on it,
don't start it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you let them dry out, it's a noticeable
chunk out of your harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's a noticeable percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that in indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about using a drip system
in an outdoor grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've promised the listeners that I would
talk about building a drip system,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not a lot of plant involvement
and I don't want to spend too much of an
[SPEAKER_01]: episode talking about building PVC pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd actually kind of be a hard episode
because it's not really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something that just go do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get your hands dirty and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give them like a five or 10 minute
primer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a pump and some tubes and a
fucking octopus head and then some tubing
[SPEAKER_01]: and some sprinklers and then you build
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems really daunting, but- Tutorial.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Jesse said, just doing it because you
got to get out there and measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a tape measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a PVC pipe cutter and just got to go
to town and learn how to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Legos basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought these two $30 kits from Lowe's
and this was last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never really done a drip system
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little nervous and by the
afternoon I'm like, I'm a fucking expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boys playing with Legos is essentially
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all of the parts over there at
Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to that little section and look
around, your head will just start spinning
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a quick lesson on it in the future
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might let you come hang out with me and
talk me through it also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we've gone 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything funny you want to ramble
and talk about chaotically, randomly that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to make sure that people hear on
a podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you got coming up that you want
to share with people?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put you guys on the spot and you're
both looking at me blankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secret Session is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, August 27th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot reveal the location, but it is
coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same day as Reggae on the Rocks,
so I've got to go to Reggae on the Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not into the headlining band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not feeling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to leave during the headlining
band, and then I'm going to go over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Secret Session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I wish I could tag you in for the
headlining band, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it my boys?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that they're able to play Reggae on
the Rocks, I'm less of a fan than I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's favorite band is- Those guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: 311 is Mike's favorite band ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Reggae on the Rocks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're playing with Iration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 311 and Iration.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing a set together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, at Reggae on the Rocks,
it's such a beautiful venue for that band.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the first time a plebeian
snuck into the Roman council or some shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggae on the Rocks has been not as reggae
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the politest way to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the band has gotten slightly more
reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of my favorite reggae bands ever are
opening the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steel Pulse, of course, if you're a reggae
fan, you know good old Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever hung out with me,
you know I love Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan Heritage is also there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my two favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to just pick two reggae bands
that defined what I like about reggae,
[SPEAKER_01]: those would be the bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great show for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get all sunburnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when it starts getting all 311-y,
that's when I'm going to take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, 311 is going to come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your hair is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met 311 backstage at Warped Tour one
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won tickets in a meet and greet from
Kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dopest thing was this dope ass
Jansport backpack I got in the giveaway
[SPEAKER_02]: too because I'm not a 311 fan either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there's a 311 used to actually
get in fistfights with Sublime,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is my favorite band.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that a lot of people, they sound
like the exact same band.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like 311 and the whole time I was
bringing up all these fights and these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys are like, man, these guys are lame
and just kind of wandered off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't as polite as you are now
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're having a little more fun
with them than you're letting on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have trolled them a little bit
before trolling people was a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's remind everybody how they can check
us all out on the social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you want to follow me on
Instagram, I am at irey underscore
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most other things just search grow from
your heart and you'll find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to send me an email,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, tell us about your podcast one more
time and how everyone can find you on the
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check me out on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can check out the podcast on

Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you support them, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have our website back up soon,
which is Colorado podcast.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys get hacked?
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to pay the bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, that's easy to fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's easy enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get that back online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking some time away from the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking some time from the Uncle Budco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for bringing Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun hanging out, dabbing with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get to see enough, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Mike, let's remind people about your
Facebook page and how to stalk you on the
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can find me at Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws on Facebook and at
[SPEAKER_00]: Newellpunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for taking time away from the wife
and the kid, the dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these Outdoor Grow episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got notebooks full of notes from
other shows from these episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I hope the listeners enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys got some useful
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you took a bunch of good notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up this part of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening, this would be a good
time for emails about tips and tricks for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got any harvest questions,
we have time to answer for you to prep for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor Harvest can be very overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know somebody that from their Facebook
post looks like they're a wee bit
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know two people that still haven't
trimmed all their shit from last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they put themselves in an even worse
predicament this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you know them very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to answer your questions on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse would love to come back and have
questions specifically laid out for him to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike would love to just come be on the
