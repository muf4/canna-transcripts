give a huge, huge shout out to Kind Pain
[SPEAKER_04]: Management in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not supporters of the show,
but what they are doing is they are
[SPEAKER_04]: growing lemon Jeffrey, which is a strain I
bred.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put that together and I got some seeds
in their hands, and they are killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have posted some lab tests up on
their Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hitting over 26% THC on the lemon
Jeffrey, and the best part is it is on
[SPEAKER_04]: shelves now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can head to Kind Pain Management.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are a medical and a recreational
facility, so anybody can grab some lemon
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeffrey, check out what I bred,
check out what Kind Pain Management did
[SPEAKER_04]: with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, huge shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I want to do on this podcast is
check out a video that somebody sent to me
[SPEAKER_04]: of three ex-cops smoking weed,
and the video is six minutes long.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to watch the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may edit parts of this out of the
podcast so that you guys don't have to sit
[SPEAKER_04]: through six whole minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may skip through parts of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how my ADD kicks in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a great video.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to watch parts of it,
and then we will talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me kill the theme song, and we are
going to play this cops smoking weed
[SPEAKER_04]: video.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts off with some dubstep music.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that's called,
but some music, and it shows three older
[SPEAKER_04]: dudes, old enough to be our fathers,
taking bong rips, and then here's what
[SPEAKER_04]: they have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time I smoked was in probably
1968 when I was in college.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time I smoked, I was 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got caught the first time I smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried it once and tell you, I was on a
water bed with a very agreeable woman and
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to Rhapsody in Blue,
which I know lasts for about 18 minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: and 40 seconds, and it lasted for,
oh hell, two or three hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of these ex-cops have just
admitted to having used cannabis illegally
[SPEAKER_04]: in their life, and now what they're doing
is taking a field sobriety test before
[SPEAKER_04]: they smoke any cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are three retired cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all know how to fuck with each other
and give each other a sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one old guy has got such shitty old
knees that he can barely pass the heel to
[SPEAKER_04]: toe walk, but this says also that it was
recorded in Washington where cannabis is
[SPEAKER_04]: legalized, so they're keeping these cops
out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cop number one now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in plain clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't look like cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their facial hair looks like cops,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plain clothes guy number one is now
hitting the bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had the presenter of the video light it
for him, and now, here, we'll let you,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll let you hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Graduated from WSU in 1970 and went to
work right in the same year and didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: retire until 97.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this old dude's taking a pretty fat
bong rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is David.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a reserve police officer from 1997
through 2004.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second dude took a pretty nice bong rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Robert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went to the police academy in the fall of
1970 and worked until the fall of 1986,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then after that, I taught as a
freelance trainer, mostly for the Criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: Justice Training Commission, taught at the
police academy for nine or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So none of these guys knew how to carb.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've all taken a couple of fat bong
hits, and now it's starting to kick in.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one guy just said, so now what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We wait?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where the fun starts.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clock shows you five minutes have gone
by, and we'll let you hear what they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought about that a lot, and as far as
I can remember, I never arrested anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: for it, but I took a lot of pot away from
people and threw it away in front of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I thought that was a bigger deterrent
than actually writing a criminal citation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should be more widely available
for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the last piece of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it certainly can be a gateway.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my favorite part, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pause it because the host is
a little bit hard to hear on this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: His audio is terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what the guy just asked these cops is,
do you think marijuana is a gateway drug?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to back up about just a
couple of seconds here because this is
[SPEAKER_04]: honestly my favorite part of the video is
this guy's answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just asked them, do you think
marijuana is a gateway drug?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll hit play.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it certainly can be a gateway
drug.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to respond to that too,
because if you look at it, everyone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: a heroin addict started out drinking milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the argument about
marijuana, and I'm not sure that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that guy just said that milk is the
gateway drug, you guys, because everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: that does heroin started off drinking
milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he really feels that way
or if he's just too high and hasn't been
[SPEAKER_04]: high in years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what just came out of his head.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was my favorite statement from
this whole video was hearing that cop say
[SPEAKER_04]: that everybody that is on heroin started
off using milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So milk is the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the one cop said he's never arrested
people, but he's taken a lot of weed away
[SPEAKER_04]: from people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's respectable.
[SPEAKER_04]: His job was to arrest people for weed and
he didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's kind of on our team a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other cop said it should be legal and
it should be more readily available for
[SPEAKER_04]: medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I applaud these cops so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep watching this video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is 15 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is 15 minutes from
the time they took the bong hit,
[SPEAKER_04]: or if this is 15 minutes from the clip
that we just saw, which would put them
[SPEAKER_04]: about 20 minutes into this stoned
adventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to hit play, turn the volume
up again, and we will see what these old
[SPEAKER_04]: guys are up to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they're smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hitting the bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Showing a montage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now 25 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're going to try to do
sobriety tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question he just asked him is
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said starting at 93 count backwards by
sevens?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do that sober.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they're doing the hold your leg up
test and the guy couldn't do five seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one guy, he did pretty good doing the
heel to toe test.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said better than before.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude was doing a heel to toe test a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said that he was fucking it up
because his knees were so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that he's smoked a little bit of
reefer, this dude just nailed the heel to
[SPEAKER_04]: toe test because his pain doesn't hurt in
his knees anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they accidentally found a good reason
to use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hit play on the video again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel a little floaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not unpleasant, but it's shadowed by
the faint discomfort of not being fully
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of what police officers do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very staunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very in control all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't necessarily allow you to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually pretty comfortable
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's relaxed and I don't
feel like I have to be in control.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this guy's enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is 45 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's claiming that marijuana is cut with
stuff, which is weird, but that's his own
[SPEAKER_02]: uneducated, you know, he doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also costs, you know, more to put
somebody in prison, not jail, but prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it costs to send them to Harvard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear that it costs more to put
somebody in prison than to send them to
[SPEAKER_04]: Harvard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're playing the game where you put
a card on your name and try to guess who's
[SPEAKER_04]: what we're going to skip part of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unnecessary, but you guys,
I don't know, given in the right
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstances, they just asked,
I'm going to back up two seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just asked, would you do it again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's their responses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm letting the YouTube video load.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told my son on the way over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I had a pretty good headache coming
on and I think my headache started to
[SPEAKER_02]: clear, clear up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you do it again?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Given in the right circumstances,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smoke again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably given the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all three of these guys said they will
smoke again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since that was their answer,
he wants them to hit the bong one more
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're all going to take, now this is
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing a montage of these three
older dudes taking bong hits and smoking a
[SPEAKER_04]: joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like, uh, like they're trying
to make it a scene from, uh, the hangover
[SPEAKER_04]: or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to wrap up this video because
I honestly don't know how much I was
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to play of that video without some
sort of usage rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me give a shout out to the person that
posted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's by cut video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you subscribe to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got 587, 139 followers,
be 140 for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and click like on
this video so they can get some credit
[SPEAKER_04]: there, but make sure you check it out,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a funny video.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to want to watch it yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we've gotten through watching
that video, let me talk about it a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, one thing I really liked is that these
dudes seemed open-minded.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't remind me of a lot of the cops
that I've dealt with that are real
[SPEAKER_04]: standoffish and think they have to be in
control of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one cop actually said that that's a
cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cop's job is to be in control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once he smoked a little bit of reefer,
he wanted to relax and lighten up and not
[SPEAKER_04]: be such a prick of a cop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I liked that he was open-minded and
wanted to participate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked that the one guy said it should be
legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what I really liked was that they
all wanted to smoke again.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, yes, we would do this again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe those cops are going to go talk
to one of their friends who is still a cop
[SPEAKER_04]: and be like, you know what, dude,
we got stoned on this video and it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: as bad as you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one of their friends is going to
watch this video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this video is going to help people
change their opinions of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if it, even if you're already a
fan of cannabis, I recommend watching it
[SPEAKER_04]: because it was highly entertaining.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to whoever sent that video
to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not remember who it was, but I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's enough of the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a few news articles that I'd like
to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this article, we'll just jump right to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article comes from the Pueblo
Chieftain and it is written by,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Dan Cinta.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's actually written by Kristen M.
[SPEAKER_04]: White.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the headline says extra marijuana tax
money set to hit the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've talked a little bit about this in
previous shows and it is finally
[SPEAKER_04]: happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, it says the Pueblo West
metropolitan district will spend an
[SPEAKER_04]: additional $200,000 on roads in the
community for the remainder of the year
[SPEAKER_04]: and a threefold approach that public works
director Dan Cinta outlined for the board
[SPEAKER_04]: recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: The extra money comes after directors
agreed to allocate the $200,000 it
[SPEAKER_04]: received from Pueblo County for marijuana
tax money toward chip sealing already
[SPEAKER_04]: planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: This county will pay the $200,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: $200,000 directly to its emulsion
supplier, freeing up $200,000 Pueblo West
[SPEAKER_04]: would have spent of its $350,000 budget
for chip sealing this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: The highest need we have in the district
right now has to do with gravel roads,
[SPEAKER_04]: Cinta told directors.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 6.2 miles of gravel roads that
when we have the storms we've had this
[SPEAKER_04]: spring, the clay underneath fails and some
stretches are impassable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be our intent to start attacking
the repair of those roads as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We propose to bring an additional staff,
equipment, and additional gravel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have recommended this several times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I've said that we should take
all this tax money that we're making here
[SPEAKER_04]: in Pueblo, Colorado and fix some of the
goddamn potholes all over the roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They have heard us.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people have spoken, the people
listened, and now they're going to fix the
[SPEAKER_04]: roads with all of that tax money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to the city of Pueblo for
actually doing something about the roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they're starting with dirt
roads that are impassable, but once those
[SPEAKER_04]: are done, they're going to fix the
potholes in my city so that my car will
[SPEAKER_04]: not sound like shit when I drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about time.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another news article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one comes from Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually found this news article in the
Pueblo chief then a big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you guys follow Nemo Punk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike sends me a lot of news articles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get right to this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline is raising the bars for pod.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something else that we've been
talking about and hinting at on the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And things are finally coming around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the sub headline says,
[SPEAKER_04]: This article is by Kristen Wyatt of the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it says, Denver beer,
wine or weed campaign is underway to ask
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver voters about allowing marijuana
consumption in bars and other places that
[SPEAKER_04]: only allow people over 21 activists who
campaign for recreational pot legalization
[SPEAKER_04]: in Colorado have launched a petition to
drive what they call limited social
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana consumption at bars.
[SPEAKER_04]: The activists need about 5,000 signatures
to get the question on November ballots.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would allow bars or clubs to allow
marijuana use as long as patrons bring
[SPEAKER_04]: their own weed and comply with clean air
laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means the pot they consume would have
to be edible or if smoked consumed on an
[SPEAKER_04]: outside patio, the way cigarette smoking
is regulated now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outdoor smoking sites would have to be
shielded from public view.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys don't know about the Clean
Air Act in Colorado, you are not allowed
[SPEAKER_04]: to smoke in a restaurant or anywhere that
serves food or basically where the public
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get a shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the word tobacco shops have
them, but you have to get like a smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: license, like a tobacco shop or a
cigarette shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to smoke in there,
they apply for a permit and you're able to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the Clean Air Act, we are not able
to smoke cannabis inside of a building.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if they do allow it, we're going to
have to step outside to an outdoor area
[SPEAKER_04]: that is shielded from public view.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll jump into the article a little bit
more here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says marijuana is now... I don't like
how they worded that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read it the way it should
have been written.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says,
[SPEAKER_04]: And I completely agree with that,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many places to buy dank buds
in Colorado, but there is nowhere to
[SPEAKER_04]: legally go smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this would change a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it would promote business.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, I wouldn't go to a bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no reason to go to a bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want anything to do with bar
girls.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do with bar dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like drunk people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I could go to that club and hang
out and take a couple of dabs and hang out
[SPEAKER_04]: with my friends that are drinking,
I would be way more inclined to go to the
[SPEAKER_04]: bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'd spend a few bucks there
because I'd have to buy a soda or some
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of juice or shit to keep my mouth
hydrated while I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, we'll keep going with the
article.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something we've been struggling
with here a lot in Colorado is getting a
[SPEAKER_04]: private club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana dispensaries are banned from
allowing on-site use of products they sell
[SPEAKER_04]: and from selling alcohol or food that
doesn't contain pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Denver proposal would only allow bring
your own consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver wouldn't be the first city to allow
marijuana in bars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Colorado Springs, the state's second
largest city, has several marijuana clubs
[SPEAKER_04]: that are tolerated if not specifically
allowed by statute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers has
told the city council that he plans to
[SPEAKER_04]: seek regulations on the clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gazette newspaper recently reported.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to three marijuana cannabis
smoking social clubs in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's kind of cool to be able
to go and hang out and just smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is the 420 Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the Lazy Lion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the original Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you as an adult 21 or over can go into
these places and you can have a dab of
[SPEAKER_04]: your own out of their rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can bring your rig or a lot of them
have a dab bar that will sell you dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them you have to pay a little fee
to get in a little cover charge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're an out of towner and you
want to come hang out and take some dabs
[SPEAKER_04]: with some Colorado kids, you know,
there's nothing wrong with going to one of
[SPEAKER_04]: those places.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually pretty damn fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ended up at a kind of a secretive place
in Denver, taking dabs all night at a
[SPEAKER_04]: Speakeasy up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just fun hanging out,
taking dabs in the club.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just replaced alcohol with dabs and
it's way fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoy it for some reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to continue with this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Denver petition comes after that city
council rejected pot friendly bars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver has several underground clubs where
patrons use marijuana for a joining fee.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the city has intermittently arrested
people for public consumption at those
[SPEAKER_04]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arresting for smoking weed again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I thought we were past that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the raids and arrests leave
tourists with nowhere to legally consume
[SPEAKER_04]: pot they've bought, argued supporters of
the ballot measure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Among the supporters is Jane West,
an events promoter who last year arranged
[SPEAKER_04]: Classically Cannabis concert with the
Colorado Symphony Orchestra.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city threatened to block the concert,
citing public consumption laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: The symphony rebranded the concerts as a
private bring your own cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: fundraiser, and the city dropped its
objections.
[SPEAKER_04]: West was convicted of a misdemeanor for
organizing a separate cannabis friendly
[SPEAKER_04]: event last year, a brunch at a bakery.
[SPEAKER_04]: An eight person SWAT team descended on the
event and shut down the brunch,
[SPEAKER_04]: West said.
[SPEAKER_04]: West became one of the first to sign the
Denver petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: The petitions are due by early August.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where's this petition?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody here in Colorado needs
to sign this.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to this podcast,
you agree with me that we need to allow
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational consumption in 21 and over
establishments for adults out of public
[SPEAKER_04]: view, out of indoor smoking areas,
so that we're able to medicate if we're a
[SPEAKER_04]: medical patient or we're able to recreate.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're a recreational smoker,
we should be able to puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people are at the bars getting wasted,
doing shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking getting drunk, getting into
fights, raping each other, being heathens.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the people that want to smoke a little
bit of weed and relax are being singled
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's time for a revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for us to be able to smoke in
these clubs where we want to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's kind of dumb that they don't
allow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to the Pueblo Chieftain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Kristen Wyatt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if you're in Colorado,
if you're a Colorado resident,
[SPEAKER_04]: find this petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking to see if there's a link to
it, but there is not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to find this petition.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to sign it, each and every one of
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's enough of that article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the next article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article is a little bit long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see how much time I've got left
here in this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've talked recently about the
discussion between the natives and the
[SPEAKER_04]: government to allow natives to grow
cannabis on native land or Indian
[SPEAKER_04]: reservations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this article comes from, where is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually from krctv.com,
which is a TV station in Southern
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is no, let's see, Megan Hunt is
the author.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's read this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, federal agents rated what
appeared to be a large scale commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana grow on the Pitt River XL
reservation and the Alturas reservation in
[SPEAKER_04]: Modoc County on Wednesday morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Photos from the scene show dozens of law
enforcement vehicles at a large greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: site.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also one photo of a bulldozer with
what appears to be a load of marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: plants in its bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: According to Lauren Horwood of the USA,
the U S attorney's office, special agents
[SPEAKER_04]: with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the
Drug Enforcement Administration and other
[SPEAKER_04]: federal states and local agencies,
conducted a search of two large scale
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana cultivation facilities located
on federally recognized tribal lands at
[SPEAKER_04]: the Alturas Indian Ranch area and the XL
ranch.
[SPEAKER_04]: At both sites, law enforcement seized a
total of at least 12,000 marijuana plants
[SPEAKER_04]: and over 100 pounds of processed
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than the contraband marijuana and
items of evidentiary value, no tribal
[SPEAKER_04]: property was seized and no federal charges
are pending, Horwood said.
[SPEAKER_04]: She explained that the search warrants are
part of an ongoing investigation relating
[SPEAKER_04]: to the financing and management of a
commercial marijuana cultivation project.
[SPEAKER_04]: The project warrant affidavits were
unsealed until today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Horwood also said that while the U S
attorney's office doesn't normally comment
[SPEAKER_04]: on ongoing investigations, because of the
public nature of this raid, they are
[SPEAKER_04]: releasing information.
[SPEAKER_04]: She explained that marijuana grows have
received substantial attention in Modoc
[SPEAKER_04]: County, as well as the U S Department of
Justice's guidance relating to marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation on tribal lands.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cultivation facility at Alturas Indian
Ranch area was located within the tribe's
[SPEAKER_04]: former event center, within approximately
100 yards of the tribe's publicly operated
[SPEAKER_04]: gaming facility, the Desert Rose Casino.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these guys were growing a major grow,
100 yards from the Desert Rose Casino,
[SPEAKER_04]: where people go all day and gamble all
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of funny to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The facility on the XL ranch was next to
Highway 395 on the banks of the Pitt
[SPEAKER_04]: River.
[SPEAKER_04]: Horwood explained that the Pitt River
facility consisted of 40 newly constructed
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse structures, each capable of
accommodating approximately 1,000
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana plants and additional gable roof
structures that boosted the square footage
[SPEAKER_04]: of roof coverage structures by another
50%.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a lot of plants, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude had 40 green, or this operation
had 40 greenhouses with a thousand plants
[SPEAKER_04]: each.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the potential of 40,000 plants in
those greenhouses plus stuff that was
[SPEAKER_04]: covered that increases their square
footage by 50%, which is another 20,000
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, if you do it mathematically,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of the grow operations, which appear
to have been operating in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_04]: each other and were in excess of the
locally enacted marijuana cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: limits applicable to county land,
Horwood said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I read something of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were both in excess of the locally
enacted marijuana cultivation limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something that's kind of,
if you're allowed to grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're able to do that legally without
being fucked with by the government,
[SPEAKER_04]: stay within your damn limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you just stay in the limits?
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys were over their limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're growing too much and that's what
got them.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're gonna keep going on the
article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says.
[SPEAKER_04]: The volume of marijuana that the XL
facility alone was capable of producing
[SPEAKER_04]: estimated approximately 40 to 60,000
plants far exceeds any prior known
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial marijuana grow operation
anywhere within the 34 county Eastern
[SPEAKER_04]: district, she added.
[SPEAKER_04]: According to tribal representatives,
all of the marijuana cultivated at both
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities was intended to be distributed
off of tribal lands at various
[SPEAKER_04]: unidentified locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the search warrant
affidavits, the investigation to date
[SPEAKER_04]: indicates both operations may have been
financed by a third party foreign
[SPEAKER_04]: national.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys, I actually found the search
warrants on Facebook for some reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was scrolling through Facebook and
somebody happened to post the search
[SPEAKER_04]: warrants and for some reason I was
completely enthralled with reading these
[SPEAKER_04]: search warrants and it was completely
entertaining for some reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not get my head out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they said that this third party
foreign national was a guy from Canada who
[SPEAKER_04]: owns Canadian cigarette companies who has
got a history of drug convictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they got a Canadian guy come into an
Indian reservation who financed a major
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He paid for everything and they were
supposed to grow the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: distribute this and allegedly get him his
portion and keep the operation going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was amazed that I found the search
warrants and all of the stuff written up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys ever get a chance to read a
technical document like that, do it just
[SPEAKER_04]: for fun if you're one of those kind of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are into that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get a kick out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not give the snitches names.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call them confidential informants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They give a long excuse why they keep them
confidential.
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk about how the raid happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk about so many small details.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys will start tripping out and
wonder if you're being watched when you
[SPEAKER_04]: read a search warrant because there are so
many small details that these guys fucked
[SPEAKER_04]: up on.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were getting their pictures taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were talking to people and all of
that shit is in the police reports and in
[SPEAKER_04]: the search warrants and you would never
assume that that shit's being told to
[SPEAKER_04]: police.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so much of it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to continue with the article if
I can find out where the hell I was.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why it goes against their
guidelines?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't make any fucking tax
money off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, you guys, these guys don't
make any fucking tax money off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, you guys, these guys got
fucked because the tribal laws and the
[SPEAKER_04]: locals said, you guys are growing too much
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They went ahead and did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They got dealt with by the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fuck around, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're allowed to grow cannabis,
if you're a native, if you're not a
[SPEAKER_04]: native, whoever you are, if you're allowed
to grow cannabis, don't throw it in their
[SPEAKER_04]: face and grow too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just follow the rules, grow what you're
allowed to grow and be thankful.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in a non-legal state,
do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't encourage you either way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're in a non-legal state and you
need medicine, grow what you can,
[SPEAKER_04]: do what you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get caught.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the search warrant that I read you
guys, they listed all of the strains that
[SPEAKER_04]: these guys were working with because the
way that a lot of this started,
[SPEAKER_04]: they pulled over one of their
transportation vehicles that was
[SPEAKER_04]: transporting plants from one grow facility
to the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy had a thousand one gallon
pots with babies in his Ryder truck or his
[SPEAKER_04]: Penske truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they listed off what he had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And dude, they had blueberry cookies in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had platinum OG in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys had some great cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Natives, the natives, the people we used
to call Indians when we were kids,
[SPEAKER_04]: those guys are an agricultural culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of their culture is based on the earth
and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: If these natives that were growing these
cannabis plants were the natives that we
[SPEAKER_04]: think of when we daydream about Indians,
those guys in my mind would grow amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love to have gotten a sample
of the shit that they grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to see what the natives are
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it's fucking dank just because
that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're outdoor people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're connected with the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're connected with plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could assume that they grow some dank,
dank weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like they're putting out a lot of
it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's all the news we're going to
do because we're at 29 minutes and 50
[SPEAKER_04]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my next news articles are going to be
a little lengthy, so they might go on the
[SPEAKER_04]: next podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may get skipped.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know how we're going to do it
around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's time to start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before I do that, I got to give a
couple of shout outs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and also big shout out to everybody
