[SPEAKER_19]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey everybody, Rasta Jeff here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Before I start the podcast, I want to send
love and respect to all of the victims of
[SPEAKER_19]: the Planned Parenthood shooting.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also want to send a huge thank you
to all of the law enforcement that helped
[SPEAKER_19]: rescue those people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's time for episode number 108 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_19]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_19]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_19]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_19]: for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_19]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_19]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_19]: letting me use the music on my show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, you guys, this podcast is brought to
you by our good friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass, made in America by
Americans.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I'm shopping for a new rig,
I like to know that what I'm paying for is
[SPEAKER_19]: going to give me a nice fat dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: I can always rely on Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't trust your dab to a rig made in
China by a Chinese child without proper
[SPEAKER_19]: eye protection or adequate pay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Buy yourself some glass made in America by
folks who dab as hard as you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass is not only a glass company,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Dougie is a huge part of the
cannabis hash movement.
[SPEAKER_19]: Support Hitman Glass and be sure to check
out the Chalice Festival in California.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go follow Hitman Glass on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: Search for Hitman Glass Dougie and give
them a follow.
[SPEAKER_19]: And be sure to visit hitmanglass.com
today.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, tonight as we record,
I'm hitting my Hitman E-Series Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my first Hitman rig, and I have
been impressed since my first rip out of
[SPEAKER_19]: any Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to Hitman Glass and Dougie.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I can remember the first time I
hit a Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hit a Hitman Sidecar with my homie,
Hank.
[SPEAKER_19]: We may have been in his car.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know nothing about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: But big shout out to my buddy,
Hank, for introducing me to the world of
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have not looked back since then.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, I know everybody likes a nice
custom rig, a nice colorful rig.
[SPEAKER_19]: Made by some fancy artist.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's always great to have in your
collection.
[SPEAKER_19]: But sometimes you pay a bunch of money and
you go to hit that rig and when you put
[SPEAKER_19]: water in it, the first time you go to draw
through it, you get water in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_19]: Every time you try to take a dab,
you get water in your mouth because the
[SPEAKER_19]: water level has to be just at this awkward
level to where when you hit it,
[SPEAKER_19]: you get water in your mouth or you can put
a little less water and not get any
[SPEAKER_19]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_19]: That never happens with a Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you buy a Hitman rig, it is always
going to hit like a fucking truck.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I recommend Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's quit rambling about glass and let's
take a dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Today we're going to hit the Hitman
E-Series Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a highly educated domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to heat this sucker up.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to do it old school.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to use a torch and not use the
e-nail today.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sitting in a different location,
so I don't have the e-nail right here,
[SPEAKER_19]: but I'm heating this nail up, getting it
nice and hot, and we're going to take a
[SPEAKER_19]: dab together and then we're going to get
on with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you guys, I hope you've got a dab
ready.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope wherever you are, whatever you're
doing, you're smoking something tasty.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_19]: This dab, you guys, goes out to Hitman
Glass and the entire Hitman crew.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was my first rig and I love the way
it hits.
[SPEAKER_19]: My first Hitman rig and I love the way it
hits.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to the Hitman crew.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm carb capping and freestyle rapping.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, I've got a whole bunch of stuff
that I want to talk about in this podcast,
[SPEAKER_19]: so let's get down to business a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to mention that my Instagram
account, the iRegenetics Instagram account
[SPEAKER_19]: was at 19,000 followers and Instagram shut
that thing down.
[SPEAKER_19]: So big middle finger to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: Instagram for that.
[SPEAKER_19]: What I would like you to do is follow my
new account.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I've got a new account going.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been posting a few pictures.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got close to a thousand followers
again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse my cough.
[SPEAKER_19]: So please go support the new iRegenetics
Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like they're out to get the
entire cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_19]: What I read today was as long as you don't
post pictures of yourself using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_19]: you can post pictures of your plants and
of your rigs and of your hash and of your
[SPEAKER_19]: buds.
[SPEAKER_19]: You just can't post pictures of yourself
smoking is what somebody tried to tell me
[SPEAKER_19]: today.
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse my coughing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did just take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems true because the accounts that
are getting deleted are people smoking and
[SPEAKER_19]: the accounts that are still there,
they don't have images of them smoking.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to try to stick with that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll just be posting pictures of plants,
pictures of me at work, pictures of stuff
[SPEAKER_19]: like that, but I won't be posting dab
videos and dab pictures to Instagram
[SPEAKER_19]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, make sure you follow the new
iRegenetics Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, I want to send a huge shout out to
my friend Seb.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if you want me to say your
whole name on the podcast, but big shout
[SPEAKER_19]: out to my friend Seb from Australia.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys have been talking about the
donation button on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you go to the website
iRegeneticsColorado.com, go to the podcast
[SPEAKER_19]: tab.
[SPEAKER_19]: There is a PayPal button on the top right.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is a donation button and every
donation you make goes directly to my
[SPEAKER_19]: PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, our friend Seb from Australia
sent me a nice donation and I really want
[SPEAKER_19]: to give you a huge thank you shout out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a huge contribution.
[SPEAKER_19]: I absolutely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It did not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you guys want to make a contribution,
I would definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll give you a big old shout out on the
show.
[SPEAKER_19]: I will be your Facebook friend.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So big shout out to our buddy Seb.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is super awesome of you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I super appreciate the contribution.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_19]: One more thing to mention.
[SPEAKER_19]: Episode number 106, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I put up episode number 106 a couple of
weeks ago and Stitcher failed to grab the
[SPEAKER_19]: episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: It would not play on Stitcher,
but since then it has been fixed.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you are a Stitcher listener,
you can go back and listen to episode
[SPEAKER_19]: number 106.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of an important episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you hang out with me, if you listen to
me and you feel like we're buddies since
[SPEAKER_19]: we've become podcast friends, episode
number 106 is kind of important.
[SPEAKER_19]: It tells you a little bit about what's
going on in my world.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you should listen if you have not.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that is available on Stitcher now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a whole bunch of stuff I want to
cover you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: So everybody knows I quit the spot
dispensary and if you don't, when you
[SPEAKER_19]: listen to episode number 106, you will
learn that because that's part of what 106
[SPEAKER_19]: is about.
[SPEAKER_19]: I no longer work at the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am now part of the green and healthy
wellness team.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am the lead cultivator for the green and
healthy wellness gardens in Colorado
[SPEAKER_19]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big shout out to my boy Hunt.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's got trust and faith in me and
understands that I am able to run this
[SPEAKER_19]: large garden by myself and produce the
quality of cannabis that they expect on
[SPEAKER_19]: their shelves.
[SPEAKER_19]: So much respect to the green and healthy
team, much respect to Hunt.
[SPEAKER_19]: But let me get back to what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_19]: I quit the spot recently.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just wasn't working for me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing personal against the spot.
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't have any plants yet and I'm a
pot grower.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I needed to be growing and that wasn't
happening.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I quit.
[SPEAKER_19]: But the spot held a contest or maybe a
raffle.
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't really a contest.
[SPEAKER_19]: What they did was anybody who spent over
$50 in purchases got their name entered
[SPEAKER_19]: into a raffle to win two tickets to the
Grateful Dead concert at the First Bank
[SPEAKER_19]: Center just a couple of nights ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't actually the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_19]: They called themselves Dead and Co.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's most of the members of the Grateful
Dead, but the bass player and the lead
[SPEAKER_19]: guitar player and the keyboard player are
new guys because, well, the guitar player
[SPEAKER_19]: is dead, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Jerry Garcia has been dead for several
years.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they had John Mayer, of all people,
replace him.
[SPEAKER_19]: They had Oteal Burbridge replace the bass
player because Phil Lesh is out with
[SPEAKER_19]: bladder cancer.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you know anything about the
Grateful Dead, you know that they just
[SPEAKER_19]: have an issue with keyboard players.
[SPEAKER_19]: Their keyboard players seem to die for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this time they had Jeff Cimenti on
keyboards.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the spot had this raffle to anybody
that spent $50 could win these tickets by
[SPEAKER_19]: being entered into a raffle.
[SPEAKER_19]: Our good friend Sloppy, who has been here
on the podcast, actually won the Grateful
[SPEAKER_19]: Dead tickets.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sloppy didn't put down his phone number or
anything.
[SPEAKER_19]: He simply wrote Sloppy on the raffle
ticket.
[SPEAKER_19]: So our good friend Mike is the manager
over at the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mike called me and he said, hey,
bro, Sloppy won these Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_19]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_19]: How do I get a hold of him?
[SPEAKER_19]: And I texted Sloppy and I said,
hey, bro, you won these Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_19]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_19]: And Sloppy said, cool, take those tickets
and have fun, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Sloppy, the man, my homie, Sloppy,
what's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sloppy threw me two free Grateful Dead
tickets.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I got to go see the Grateful Dead on,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_19]: Was it Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I get to go see this version of the
Grateful Dead on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it's great because I quit the
spot a week ago and I'm still getting
[SPEAKER_19]: perks and hookups from the spot.
[SPEAKER_19]: So shout out to the spot for the free
Grateful Dead tickets.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also a super huge shout out to my boy
Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I told him I had Grateful Dead
tickets, he didn't even hesitate.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was like, those are yours, go have fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: So big shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to Dave.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was good bumping into you over at the
Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was kind of a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_19]: And also a big shout out to Rachel.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was good seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was fun watching you blow big old vape
clouds through the whole show.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, I got to go see the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it's kind of neat that the job
I quit a week ago, kind of in a roundabout
[SPEAKER_19]: way, gave me free tickets to go see the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was ironic in my mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: But the Grateful Dead, holy crap,
that was such a good show.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're at a whole new level of playing.
[SPEAKER_19]: The music is refreshed.
[SPEAKER_19]: I said it a minute ago and you guys
probably scratched your head and said,
[SPEAKER_19]: what?
[SPEAKER_19]: John Mayer plays for the Grateful Dead
now?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that happened.
[SPEAKER_19]: A few years ago, John Mayer did something
stupid and I don't pay a lot of attention,
[SPEAKER_19]: but he said something stupid somewhere and
it messed up his musical career and people
[SPEAKER_19]: did not like him.
[SPEAKER_19]: So he kind of took a little hiatus and
went away for a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: And while he was finding himself,
he discovered the Grateful Dead and
[SPEAKER_19]: discovered the Grateful Dead music and the
way of the dead and the community and
[SPEAKER_19]: really got into it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And somehow ended up playing guitar for
the Grateful Dead now.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: At first I was skeptical because John
Mayer is not my style of music at all.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's like girl music.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like teenager music in my mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, I know I'm a prick because I'm
really judgmental about music.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I got to say, when I saw John Mayer
playing with the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_19]: he nails it.
[SPEAKER_19]: He gets it perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: He does everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything exactly the way it should be
done.
[SPEAKER_19]: His tone is perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: He does not overplay.
[SPEAKER_19]: The dude knows how to play a guitar.
[SPEAKER_19]: He can sing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: He sang a few tunes and they sounded
perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you guys get a chance to go see any
Grateful Dead shows, if you're a Grateful
[SPEAKER_19]: Dead fan, I definitely recommend you go
check it out and get there early.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Enjoy the lot singing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big shout out to my buddy Gibbs.
[SPEAKER_19]: I took Gibbs with me to the Grateful Dead
show and we had a great time.
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't seen Gibbs in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was a wonderful time hanging out
with my brother.
[SPEAKER_19]: My brother Gibbs at the Grateful Dead
show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to the entire Deadhead family.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to keep moving on with the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I'm really rambly today.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I hope you guys are into that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got an event coming up on the next
weekend.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody knows that I bred this strain of
weed for the lovely Miss Dude It's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you guys aren't following Dude It's
Damsel on Instagram, you're missing out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you go follow my friend,
Dude It's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's the manager at Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's an alternative model and her
Instagram pictures will put a smile on
[SPEAKER_19]: your face.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I did breed a strain of cannabis for
our friend Damsel and we are having an
[SPEAKER_19]: official tasting party at the Dude It's
Gatsby Invitational on the fourth and
[SPEAKER_19]: fifth of next month.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I will record.
[SPEAKER_19]: I will do my best to record with Damsel
and get a little bit of that onto the
[SPEAKER_19]: show.
[SPEAKER_19]: But what we're going to do is Damsel is
bringing a few of her friends from out of
[SPEAKER_19]: town.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hunt, myself, and a couple other dudes
will be at the event.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've rented a house in Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a private party.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've rented a house and we're going to
have a tasting party.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got 10 jars in front of me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to crack one open right now just
for fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got 10 jars of herb that I grew for
the lovely Damsel.
[SPEAKER_19]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to have a little tasting party
and Miss Damsel is going to decide which
[SPEAKER_19]: of these phenotypes gets to be the
selection that will take the name of
[SPEAKER_19]: Damsel's Dank and then we will get a clone
into the shop and we will start growing
[SPEAKER_19]: Damsel's Dank at Green and Healthy
Wellness in Colorado Springs and it will
[SPEAKER_19]: be available on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be a little while, but we'll get
it there and the whole world with a
[SPEAKER_19]: medical card will be able to try it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully, eventually Colorado Springs
will wake up and start allowing
[SPEAKER_19]: recreational cannabis sales and that way
we can make Damsel's Dank available to the
[SPEAKER_19]: entire world.
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big shout out to Hunt for putting me in
touch with Damsel and also a huge shout
[SPEAKER_19]: out to the lovely dude at Damsel.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Britt, thanks for giving me the honor
of being the breeder chosen to create a
[SPEAKER_19]: stream for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand how important this is to you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to get it right for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: The next thing I want to do is a little
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_19]: This will be a very simple lesson.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was watching a Facebook argument the
other day and people were arguing over a
[SPEAKER_19]: plant being male or female.
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought I'd just come on here and just
make it really clear and simple and we'll
[SPEAKER_19]: talk about what a male and a female plant
look like.
[SPEAKER_19]: When it comes time to determine the sex of
your plants, there are a few ways you can
[SPEAKER_19]: go about doing it.
[SPEAKER_19]: The main way that you can do it is to just
flower your plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got a plant and you put it under
1212, which is 12 hours on and 12 hours
[SPEAKER_19]: off of light, and you need full darkness
in your dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, you need complete darkness
uninterrupted for 12 full hours.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can see anything in that room in
the dark cycle, it is too bright.
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to make it darker.
[SPEAKER_19]: If there's any light, it's not dark
enough.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is not considered dark.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face, it is too light in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: The only lights that you can have in a
grow room during the dark cycle are green
[SPEAKER_19]: LED lights or those green coiled
fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those will work for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: You need green light in your dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_19]: Green lighting during the flowering cycle
does not interrupt the flowering photo
[SPEAKER_19]: period because the plants are green and
they do not absorb green light.
[SPEAKER_19]: By putting any plant into the 1212 period,
you will actually induce the flowering
[SPEAKER_19]: stage.
[SPEAKER_19]: In about 10 to 14 days ish, you'll be able
to tell if your plant is male or female by
[SPEAKER_19]: signs that it shows.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll talk about those here in just a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, you can flower a plant at any
size.
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't matter how big it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going to happen is it's going to
flower when you put it into 1212.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what's going to make it flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: What I always recommend is that you take a
clone from every seed that you grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you start a plant from seed,
please take a clone from it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_19]: You might be growing the most amazing
strain anybody has ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_19]: It may be the perfect medicinal strain for
everybody on the planet, for the entire
[SPEAKER_19]: population.
[SPEAKER_19]: It can cure every ailment.
[SPEAKER_19]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you didn't take a clone, you're going
to be so mad at yourself about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's one strain that I grew that got
away.
[SPEAKER_19]: I could not get it to clone.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was some of the best cannabis I've ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a little mad at myself that I couldn't
get it to clone, but I do have more seeds
[SPEAKER_19]: of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully, I can find that phenotype
again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Grow a plant from seed and then put it
under 1212 and it will flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: I always recommend taking a clone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Take a clone.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got a plant that has grown for a
little while and you've got a clone.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can either flower out that original
plant that has been growing and that way
[SPEAKER_19]: you've got a little bit of product to show
for yourself and you've got something to
[SPEAKER_19]: smoke and make it worth your time,
or you can flower out that clone.
[SPEAKER_19]: As soon as that clone that you took starts
showing roots, you can switch that light
[SPEAKER_19]: to 1212 and that clone will flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: In 10 to 14 days, you'll have a little
tiny plant with either male or female
[SPEAKER_19]: flowers coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll be able to tell if you've got a boy
or a girl.
[SPEAKER_19]: At that point, you can either throw away
that male plant that you've got that's in
[SPEAKER_19]: the bigger pot or you can put that female
plant into the flowering room and start
[SPEAKER_19]: making buds out of it or keep it as a
mother plant and keep taking clones off of
[SPEAKER_19]: it and have that strain around forever.
[SPEAKER_19]: Take clones, you guys, and then you can
either clone that original clone or flower
[SPEAKER_19]: that original clone as it roots out and
then you can see what you've got or you
[SPEAKER_19]: can flower that original plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Either way, it's going to do the same
thing and you will know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_19]: Please take a clone.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't stress that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, you guys, the plants will show sex
if you let them pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you leave a plant in a pot for long
enough to where it feels like it's
[SPEAKER_19]: starting to get root-bound and it's
reached its space, its space constraints
[SPEAKER_19]: in that pot, it will actually start to
flower on its own.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some genetics will just panic and start to
flower on their own that way and they will
[SPEAKER_19]: show you what is called a pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just the plant showing you that
it's reaching maturity, that it is ready
[SPEAKER_19]: to go, that its hormones are built up,
that it wants you to switch the flowering
[SPEAKER_19]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_19]: Simply waiting for the plant to pre-flower
is a good way to determine if you've got a
[SPEAKER_19]: male or a female, but then you do waste a
lot of light and a lot of nutrients and a
[SPEAKER_19]: lot of space.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're a productive gardener,
sometimes you just can't deal with that.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why I recommend cutting a clone and
flowering out that little clone and seeing
[SPEAKER_19]: what you've got.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a lot easier to waste a little bit of
time under a fluorescent light than it is
[SPEAKER_19]: to waste time under that big thousand watt
high pressure sodium lamp where you could
[SPEAKER_19]: have been running a useful crop.
[SPEAKER_19]: Take some clones, flower them out,
see what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, it feels like it's time to talk about
what to look
[SPEAKER_19]: for when your plants do start flowering.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you see two little hairs sticking up,
those are your female plant parts.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are actually the parts that if you
were to spread pollen in the room,
[SPEAKER_19]: the pollen would land on those little
pistols.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are called pistols.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those pistols would slide the pollen up
into the ovule, which would absorb the
[SPEAKER_19]: pollen, which would then pollinate your
plant and then it would produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got those little hairs,
you have got girls.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got those balls, you've got male
plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: Unless you plan on making some seeds and
doing some breeding, it is time to get
[SPEAKER_19]: those boy plants out of the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, if you're listening to this
lesson and you're learning about how to
[SPEAKER_19]: determine sex, please do not breed
cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_19]: Please learn a lot more about plants
before you breed.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll touch on that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll try to remember to mention why.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you see balls, get those plants out of
there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, here's a good hint.
[SPEAKER_19]: The male plants, I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been breeding plants for a long time.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been growing plants for a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: One thing I really notice is the male
plants grow much, much taller.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got a plant that's just taken
off, it's just getting really,
[SPEAKER_19]: really tall.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a real thick, fibrous stalk.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's probably a boy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just count on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get so excited that you've got this
one plant that grows like a son of a
[SPEAKER_19]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is probably a son of that bitch.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably a boy.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to want to get rid of that in
the future.
[SPEAKER_19]: As soon as you flower it, you will know.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pull the males as soon as you can,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got male and female plants
flowering next to each other, by day 14,
[SPEAKER_19]: that male plant is getting ready to drop
pollen.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen them drop pollen around two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_19]: The second to third week, that male plant
is really going to start spitting out his
[SPEAKER_19]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Your female plants are going to be just
ready to take pollen at that time.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to end up with a seeded crop
if you don't pay attention and get those
[SPEAKER_19]: boys out of there.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you leave those boys in too long,
they'll seed up the entire room very
[SPEAKER_19]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just takes one quick little pass of the
fan to spread that pollen through the
[SPEAKER_19]: whole room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you've got a pollinated crop.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got seeds everywhere.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pay attention, check every single day,
get the males out of there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Be diligent about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't relax.
[SPEAKER_19]: Stay on top of that shit and get those out
of there.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: It feels like I've talked enough about
male plants and how to identify them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's talk a little bit about
hermaphrodites because hermaphrodites can
[SPEAKER_19]: really confuse a new grower.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shit, hermaphrodites can confuse an
experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_19]: A hermaphrodite is, and there are a lot of
words for it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll hear people call it a hermy or a
herm.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a hermaphrodite, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a plant that has both male and
female sexes, and it will show that them
[SPEAKER_19]: hopefully very early in flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, sometimes you don't see it
until week eight on a nine-week plant,
[SPEAKER_19]: and then it starts showing a little pollen
sack.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you're like, gosh, shit, I got to cut
this plant or I got to pick this pollen
[SPEAKER_19]: sack out.
[SPEAKER_19]: You start panicking.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's talk about hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you see a plant with male and female
parts coming out of it during flower,
[SPEAKER_19]: you've probably got yourself a
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oftentimes, this happens in regular
breeding, and it often happens in
[SPEAKER_19]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is something that just happens.
[SPEAKER_19]: I breed regular and feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of people try to hate on feminized
seeds for hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_19]: If feminized seeds are made correctly,
they will not be hermaphrodites,
[SPEAKER_19]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: They will be good seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've gotten more hermaphrodites from
regular seeds than I have from feminized
[SPEAKER_19]: seeds, and I'm a breeder and I run a lot
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't blame it on the feminized seeds at
all.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it is just something that happens.
[SPEAKER_19]: You get males, you get females,
and you get hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_19]: The whole goal of this plant, its whole
goal is to reproduce itself.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it wants to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a horny plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a horny male.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a horny girl.
[SPEAKER_19]: They just want to find another plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to make seeds so that the seeds
can drop into the ground, and those seeds
[SPEAKER_19]: can happen again next year.
[SPEAKER_19]: This whole plant's goal is to just
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes it will do whatever it's got to
reproduce, and one of its fail-safe backup
[SPEAKER_19]: plans is to become a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes that happens.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I've said that that can be a trait
that is just in the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: That can be in the DNA of that plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: That plant can be born as a hermaphrodite,
but sometimes hermaphrodites are caused by
[SPEAKER_19]: environment or mistakes.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you interrupt the dark cycle during the
flowering period, I talked earlier about
[SPEAKER_19]: how you have to have that complete 12-12
photo period with 12 hours of complete
[SPEAKER_19]: uninterrupted darkness.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you interrupt that, you will cause your
plants to hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you seriously, if you open up that door
and left that light on for six hours
[SPEAKER_19]: during one dark cycle, you will start to
see male flowers pop up in your female
[SPEAKER_19]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll see it happen, and you will have a
seeded plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: It happens like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is the kind of thing that can cause
hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of the chem-dog and kush strains,
if you push them too hard with nutrients
[SPEAKER_19]: or just give them a little bit of stress
somehow, if they get bugs or powdery
[SPEAKER_19]: mildew, they'll hermaphrodite on you just
in a survival method.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is something that that plant wants to
do just to make sure that it gets to carry
[SPEAKER_19]: on with its race.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just wants to keep going on with its
life.
[SPEAKER_19]: So hermaphrodites can be really confusing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shit does happen like that in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's your job as a grower to be aware of
it and to learn how to identify it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you see pollen sacks and pistols on
the same plant, you've probably got a
[SPEAKER_19]: hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is not worth keeping.
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to get rid of that plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: No matter how good it looks, no matter how
sweet it smells, that plant needs to go.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, if your plant is well into the
flowering cycle and you've got big old
[SPEAKER_19]: chunky buds and you're starting to see
these pollen sacks come up, these little
[SPEAKER_19]: male flowers, they look like little
bananas, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just looks like maybe a piece of rice
or just it's a little tiny, tiny
[SPEAKER_19]: micro-sized banana popping up out of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a little male pollen sack,
this little male flower coming out of your
[SPEAKER_19]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oftentimes, that stuff will happen late in
flower, somewhere between week seven and
[SPEAKER_19]: nine.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're past week seven or past,
yeah, I'd say past week seven and you see
[SPEAKER_19]: those, you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anytime before week seven, you guys,
if I see that shit, that plant is dead.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just murder it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got availability to more plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got access to seeds and clones like
you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm a little picky.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not afraid to euthanize a plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes shit just has to go.
[SPEAKER_19]: If it doesn't work for my grow room,
sometimes a certain plant and your
[SPEAKER_19]: environment, that's called a phenotypical
expression, the plant will express that it
[SPEAKER_19]: is not happy with your environment and it
won't work for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you just got to get rid of that plant
and grow a different plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you start seeing those bananas
popping up around week six or seven or
[SPEAKER_19]: eight, you have a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_19]: If they're popping up around week nine,
it's not that bad because you've only got
[SPEAKER_19]: a few days left.
[SPEAKER_19]: Most plants are going to go about nine,
maybe 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got a plant that you're ending
up week seven and you start seeing little
[SPEAKER_19]: nanners popping up, you want to figure out
if you want to keep that plant going.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it worth risking the rest of the
garden?
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes those little bananas are sterile
and they don't produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes one of those can rupture and it
will pollinate the plant that that banana
[SPEAKER_19]: is on and it will pollinate the plants all
around that plant as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes it can pollinate the whole room.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, it doesn't take much pollen to
create seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so now you'll have seeds in all of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you've got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to try to eliminate the plant?
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to risk it?
[SPEAKER_19]: Or do you want to try to get rid of those
bananas?
[SPEAKER_19]: What you can do to those little male
flowers, you can mist them with water
[SPEAKER_19]: because water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_19]: So just mist the plant with water and then
get some tweezers and pluck out those
[SPEAKER_19]: little bananas.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're around week eight, week nine,
just pluck those out if you want to.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're in week nine, just leave it
there and don't touch it until you harvest
[SPEAKER_19]: and you should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's popping up in week nine,
it's probably sterile.
[SPEAKER_19]: But sometimes it's scary and you don't
want to risk it around week seven or week
[SPEAKER_19]: eight.
[SPEAKER_19]: You might want to pluck them out.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's when you have a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you're a breeder, do not ever breed
with a plant that'll make a hermaphrodite,
[SPEAKER_19]: a little pop up, a little male plant
around week seven, eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't do that because then you're going to
breed that hermaphroditic trait into
[SPEAKER_19]: something.
[SPEAKER_19]: So make sure you pull out the
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_19]: Keep an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a decision you're going to have to
make.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's going to happen at some point in
your grow career.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to see a female plant popping
up a male flower in week eight and you're
[SPEAKER_19]: going to panic.
[SPEAKER_19]: But don't worry.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can either pluck out that male.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can let it grow or you can just
destroy the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can always turn those seeded plants
into really good hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think plants that are allowed to seed
make better hash than plants without
[SPEAKER_19]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't get as much hash sometimes,
but I think that the high is better once
[SPEAKER_19]: you allow the plants to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I only know that because I breed.
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes when I breed, there's
material leftover.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, most of the time when I breed,
there's material leftover.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to separate the seeds from the
actual bud and we will run the bud
[SPEAKER_19]: material and turn it into BHO.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I like the seeded BHO.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no seeds in the BHO, but I mean,
it comes from seeded materials.
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeds are removed.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we run the material.
[SPEAKER_19]: The seeds are packaged and grown.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the material is turned into hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that hash seems to get me a little bit
better of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_19]: I talked earlier about new growers not
breeding and hermaphrodites are a little
[SPEAKER_19]: bit of why.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me touch on why I said, please don't
breed if you're a new grower.
[SPEAKER_19]: Breeding takes a very selective eye.
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to understand what plants you're
putting together.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you're putting a plant,
a plant needs to be properly tested before
[SPEAKER_19]: it's bred.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have talked about how I stress test a
plant before I'll breed with it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll take a girl plant and I will try to
piss that plant off the best I can and see
[SPEAKER_19]: what it takes to make that plant
hermaphrodite or die or stress or
[SPEAKER_19]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I make sure it's not going to herm on
me.
[SPEAKER_19]: And more importantly, I make sure that the
progeny, the offspring, the seeds that
[SPEAKER_19]: come from that female plant, I make sure
that they're not going to hermaphrodite on
[SPEAKER_19]: you.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you have to have a plant, you have to
stress the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to have a properly selected male.
[SPEAKER_19]: The eye for a male selection is a skill.
[SPEAKER_19]: I plan to have a conversation with other
breeders on this show about male
[SPEAKER_19]: selection.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll give you a heads up on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: But selecting a male is definitely a
special skill.
[SPEAKER_19]: Selecting plants for breeding is a,
it's a skill.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an art.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you're not experienced with the
plants you're using, you may breed some
[SPEAKER_19]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you're going to have a bunch of
seeds and you're going to give those seeds
[SPEAKER_19]: out and you're going to grow those
bullshit seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's going to, the whole idea of
breeding cannabis is to improve the
[SPEAKER_19]: genetics, to improve the race,
to make the plant better.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you're breeding bullshit into it,
you're just watering it down and you're
[SPEAKER_19]: spreading genetics that are a waste of
time, that are a waste of people's garden
[SPEAKER_19]: space when they could have been growing
some usable medicine that would have
[SPEAKER_19]: worked for them.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not dissing any new growers.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just asking you, please don't try to
breed until you're a little more familiar
[SPEAKER_19]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you have to listen to a podcast and
learn how to sex your plants, then you're
[SPEAKER_19]: not ready to breed.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just being honest with you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Learn slowly.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when you're ready to breed,
I'll be here to help you out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not trying to get rid of you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just trying to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_19]: Learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we'll learn how to breed.
[SPEAKER_19]: You gotta learn to ride the bike before
you can do wheelies, brah.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: It feels like I've been going on for about
30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_19]: Look at that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I went 29 minutes and I didn't even make
any notes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't look at the clock.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope you guys enjoy listening to that
little lesson on how to sex your ganja
[SPEAKER_19]: plant.

[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see
[SPEAKER_06]: you in seven days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_19]: welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's time for episode number 109 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_19]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_19]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_19]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_19]: for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_19]: My friends call me Ross the Jeff.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_19]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_19]: Roots band.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for letting me use your music on my
show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope everybody's having a great afternoon,
morning, evening, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_19]: wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope you got something rolled up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope you got a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope you got a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope you got an edible in you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope you got something good going on.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope you're getting turped out in some
way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey guys, this is another episode that
comes from the car, but this is sort of a
[SPEAKER_19]: part two.
[SPEAKER_19]: Recently I did an episode about ways to
improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this is a part two of that episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: More ways on how to improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_19]: I also include a little rant towards the
end.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did have to stop recording halfway
through because I arrived at my
[SPEAKER_19]: destination, but I did start recording on
the way home.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a little cut in the middle,
but I hope you enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Before I go too far, this podcast is
brought to you by my good friends at
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big shout out to the crew at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you support Hitman Dougie and
the entire Hitman Glass crew.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass is made in America by
Americans.
[SPEAKER_19]: Today we're hitting the Hitman and Sampson
collab.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is one of my favorite rigs in my
collection.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got like a, I'd say a six inch tall
can with a straight up, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_19]: the piece where the bowl or the nail
attaches go straight up.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a mouthpiece that comes out of
the side.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a beautiful green worked base,
maybe a turquoise color in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a green Hitman logo here on the
side.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a green Hitman flame across the
mouthpiece there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to do myself a fat favor and
we're going to take a dab and then we are
[SPEAKER_19]: going to get into the part of the podcast
where I am in the car.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to start heating up this
nail.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to let the music fade in and
then I will be in the car the next time
[SPEAKER_19]: you hear my voice.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big shout out to my friends at Hitman.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you guys follow Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you check out HitmanGlass.com.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you support them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you follow Hitman Glass Dougie.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are a bunch of members of the Hitman
fam.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you type in a hashtag HitFam,
hashtag HitmanGlass, you'll find a bunch
[SPEAKER_19]: of great glass that you would like to
follow, you'd like to see more of.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big thanks for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's get on to the part with me in the
car.
[SPEAKER_19]: Here you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to take a dab out of this Hitman
Sampson collab and I'll be right back with
[SPEAKER_19]: you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you
with another episode from the car.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm headed northbound on I-25.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm currently passing through the lovely
town of Fountain, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm on my way to Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm headed to The Grow at Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got to go do the evening check.
[SPEAKER_19]: We are now in flower, so I need to go
check on the plants just before the lights
[SPEAKER_19]: go off.
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to go make sure that the timer
shuts off appropriately and make sure that
[SPEAKER_19]: all the heating and cooling works the way
it should for the night cycles.
[SPEAKER_19]: Go check on some clones.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, I've been spending a lot of time
on the road.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have a lot of time at home or
studio time the past week.
[SPEAKER_19]: This weekend was the Dude It's Gatsby
Invitational, so I spent most of the
[SPEAKER_19]: weekend in Colorado Springs with the
Grimey Gatsby family.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I spent most of the weekend in Colorado
Springs with the Grimey Gatsby family,
[SPEAKER_19]: the Dude It's Damsel crew and the Turpex
boys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I recorded two podcasts that need to be
edited and put together from the weekend,
[SPEAKER_19]: but they will be out pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_19]: That should be episodes 110 and maybe 112.
[SPEAKER_19]: I might put another episode between there.
[SPEAKER_19]: You never know what I'm going to do,
but I've got a couple episodes coming to
[SPEAKER_19]: you from the house in Colorado Springs
where we hosted the Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_19]: Invitational, a house full of models and
DAB kids.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a pretty good time, I would have to
say.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would recommend that you guys go to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're on Instagram, go to Instagram
and search the hashtag Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_19]: and check out some of the shots we took
there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, check out some of the shots on Dude
It's Damsel's Instagram and also on the
[SPEAKER_19]: Grimey Gatsby on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, you can check out my new
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: Iri Underscore Genetics on Instagram is my
new page.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did start a new Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, I don't know if I've mentioned
that on the podcast yet, but I am back on
[SPEAKER_19]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to follow all of the rules.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been told that you can't put photos
of yourself consuming cannabis,
[SPEAKER_19]: so that means no DAB videos, no fat joint
shots, none of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was told that you can't have contact
information on your Instagram,
[SPEAKER_19]: so I'm not going to put any contact
information up there just to keep us safe.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys know how to find me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you go follow the new Instagram
page.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was at 19,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_19]: They took me down.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am already back up to about 1,500 or
1,600 by the time this airs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully, with all of the shout-outs and
things from Damsel from the weekend,
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be close to the 2,500 mark.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, that's enough rambling about the
Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really encourage you guys to go look at
some of the pictures that were taken on
[SPEAKER_19]: Instagram, and we will also post a podcast
that tells you all about the Dude It's
[SPEAKER_19]: Gatsby Invitational, what it is,
who was involved, and why it happened.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got to edit that down.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a great show.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got stupid high, you guys, so it'll be
a fun show to listen to.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, I'm driving on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm kind of rambly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's talk about something.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a couple of notes here.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're hard to read because I'm driving,
but I wrote this down.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been watching a show on Netflix,
a show called Narcos.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a show about Pablo Escobar and his
drug empire that he created.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had no idea the dude was so huge.
[SPEAKER_19]: I knew he was huge, but I didn't know that
this dude was super huge.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've never seen that kind of money.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody else has ever seen that kind of
money.
[SPEAKER_19]: That dude was building forts out of $100
bills, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_19]: That shit is awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, something that happens in the show
Narcos.
[SPEAKER_19]: Narcos is on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a 10-episode season.
[SPEAKER_19]: I recommend you watch it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Something that happened recently made me
chuckle.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to come out on the show and say,
that shit will not work.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pablo Escobar is standing on the balcony
having a little thought time by himself.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's just thinking and reflecting and
staring off into the nowhere.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then he turns to the right and there's a
ganja plant to the right of him.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not mature.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's nowhere near done.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pablo just grabs a little bud off the
stalk and pinches it off and gives it a
[SPEAKER_19]: good smell and sticks it into his pocket.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, that may do a little for him,
but that weed is going to suck.
[SPEAKER_19]: That plant was not finished.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can't just pick buds off of a plant
randomly.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not like an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_19]: You got to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You got to trim it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You got to dry it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You got to do it properly.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was a little goofy, but everything
about the cocaine, about the production,
[SPEAKER_19]: the shipment, everything about cocaine
seems to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_19]: They've talked about how they make
cocaine, how they process cocaine,
[SPEAKER_19]: how they hide cocaine.
[SPEAKER_19]: All of that has seemed to be fairly
accurately done, but when it came to
[SPEAKER_19]: growing a little bit of weed, they had no
idea what they were talking about on that
[SPEAKER_19]: show.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to mention that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_19]: I talked about the Dude It's Gatsby
invitation.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to go through my notes here.
[SPEAKER_19]: This podcast is going to be a follow-up to
a recent show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Recently, I did an episode that was aimed
at how to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_19]: Once I posted that show, I realized there
were a couple of things that I really
[SPEAKER_19]: skipped, things that I've been thinking
about that would definitely help you
[SPEAKER_19]: improve your crop that I should have
mentioned in that show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me scroll up on my phone here while
I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: You got to be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to do this safely.
[SPEAKER_19]: More ways to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to talk about the importance of
pH.
[SPEAKER_19]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to talk about the importance of
pH.
[SPEAKER_19]: pH stands for potential hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_19]: pH is super important for your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you're making a solution,
when you're mixing your nutrients in your
[SPEAKER_19]: bucket or in your reservoir, however
you're mixing it, you need to adjust the
[SPEAKER_19]: pH before you feed it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mix up all of your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have everything in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_19]: Stick your pH pen, your pH meter in there
and see what the pH says.
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's like seven, it needs to come down,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want your pH for your plants to be
somewhere between six and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you'd be much happier.
[SPEAKER_19]: Your plants will look better.
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll take up the nutrients more
properly.
[SPEAKER_19]: The plants will grow better.
[SPEAKER_19]: You won't see as many problems.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of times, a pH problem will mask
itself as a deficiency or a nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you just go ahead and fix your pH,
you have to fix the pH of the solution
[SPEAKER_19]: you're feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're feeding it nutrients,
if you're feeding it water, adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you guys are feeding it teas,
don't mess with the pH of a tea because
[SPEAKER_19]: the tea is organic.
[SPEAKER_19]: Trying to add something to bring down the
pH of your tea will probably kill off your
[SPEAKER_19]: microbes and whatever you're trying to
build up in the tea.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just let that go.
[SPEAKER_19]: That'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't stress too much on the pH of your
soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you bought good soil at a grow store,
your pH will be just fine as long as
[SPEAKER_19]: you're feeding it properly pH nutrients,
a properly pH solution.
[SPEAKER_19]: Once you're done mixing up your nutrients,
pH it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get some pH.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get a pH pen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Stick it in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: See what it says.
[SPEAKER_19]: Add very little pH down.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're using a five gallon jug,
it's not going to take much pH down to get
[SPEAKER_19]: your pH to drop massively.
[SPEAKER_19]: Check your pH.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pay attention to the pH.
[SPEAKER_19]: I see a lot of people skipping that.
[SPEAKER_19]: They think it's not important.
[SPEAKER_19]: They think it's not going to mess with
their plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: They think it's just one more thing to
worry about, but it's one more thing that
[SPEAKER_19]: can definitely improve the quality of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: Adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, let's talk about the importance of
getting the lights close enough.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Got to clear the throat there.
[SPEAKER_19]: I see a lot of people with their lights
real high in the garden.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're using Gavitas, you do need that
three foot gap, but unless you're using
[SPEAKER_19]: double ended bulbs, there's no need to
have the bulbs way high above the plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got the type of hoods that are
ducted and have glass inside of them,
[SPEAKER_19]: and if you're venting them properly and
the room is air conditioned, you can
[SPEAKER_19]: probably get those light reflectors right
down on top of the plants really close.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to get them right.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a section that comes off the bulb
that is kind of too bright for the plant,
[SPEAKER_19]: and those lumens I guess they are that are
coming off the bulb right there,
[SPEAKER_19]: that spectrum is too much for the plant
right around the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: That eight to 10, maybe 12 inch circle
around the bulb.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you get a little further,
about 10, 12, maybe 14 inches away from
[SPEAKER_19]: that thousand watt bulb, you're going to
get optimal growth right there.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can cool it and keep it cooler,
you can get closer and pay attention to
[SPEAKER_19]: the plants and see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I see a lot of people that have their
lights way too far away from the plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get your plants closer to your lights.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to get that light right on there,
nice and intense.
[SPEAKER_19]: Light is the most used nutrient that your
plants will receive.
[SPEAKER_19]: So make sure you flood them with light and
also try to give them the appropriate
[SPEAKER_19]: light.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're in the veg cycle, you want
lights that lead more to the blue
[SPEAKER_19]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're in the flowering cycle,
you want lights that lead more to the red
[SPEAKER_19]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So make sure you've got enough light.
[SPEAKER_19]: Try to get your plants close to the light
and use as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_19]: Guys, you can burn your plants with your
light.
[SPEAKER_19]: So pay attention to that, but get them
close.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_19]: What does my next note say?
[SPEAKER_19]: My next note says CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't write a lot of notes about this,
but CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to improve the quality of your
crop, if you want to make your plants grow
[SPEAKER_19]: more quickly, more heartily, and if you
want bigger, fatter harvests, add a little
[SPEAKER_19]: bit of CO2 enrichment to your grow room.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can go to the grow store and you can
get tanks of CO2 and you can get a setup
[SPEAKER_19]: to distribute the CO2 properly through
your room.
[SPEAKER_19]: You may have to rethink your ducting and
your ventilation situation if you're going
[SPEAKER_19]: to do that, but CO2 will drastically
increase the quality of your grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe not the quality completely,
but the harvest weight, you will
[SPEAKER_19]: definitely see a difference.
[SPEAKER_19]: The ambient air outside and in your grow
room probably contains about 400 particles
[SPEAKER_19]: per million of CO2.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you get an enrichment system,
maybe a CO2 burner, maybe some tanks,
[SPEAKER_19]: whatever you decide to do, you're going to
have to think about that one and talk to
[SPEAKER_19]: the guys at the Hydro Shop, maybe do some
research on that.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're going to put CO2 in your room,
you're going to need to think about how to
[SPEAKER_19]: do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: My point is you can get that CO2 up to
1,600 ppm.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can get it four times what it is in
the natural environment and your plants
[SPEAKER_19]: will love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those plants want to suck up the CO2.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can add CO2 to your grow and that
would greatly increase your harvest
[SPEAKER_19]: weight.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're going to add CO2 and you're
going to start getting bigger buds,
[SPEAKER_19]: something that really helps with all
gardens and something I'm learning now
[SPEAKER_19]: that I'm running this giant commercial
garden is trellising.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, trellising and a screen of grain
method, if you can set up a scrog,
[SPEAKER_19]: that is a huge way to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_19]: You will give yourself more canopy space.
[SPEAKER_19]: More canopy space gives you more room to
grow more buds.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody wants more buds.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, you're able to get more airflow to
the bottom of the plants, the plants like
[SPEAKER_19]: that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that a scrog is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll do a whole episode on how to do a
scrog when I'm in the studio and I'm not
[SPEAKER_19]: on the road because I will definitely want
to pay a little bit of attention.
[SPEAKER_19]: Spence and I talked about it a while back,
but I wasn't sold on the idea and I wasn't
[SPEAKER_19]: exactly sure how to do it, so I didn't do
the idea justice, but you guys,
[SPEAKER_19]: we will talk about how to scrog on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so use some sort of trellising
system, a screen of grain, a net,
[SPEAKER_19]: get those plants in there and get them
supported, get them spread out.
[SPEAKER_19]: That would definitely help with your
garden.
[SPEAKER_19]: Something that I see a lot of people
neglecting to do that I think would
[SPEAKER_19]: greatly improve the quality of your
garden.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll also save your trimmers a lot of
headaches, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it would be really useful for you
to get in there and lollipop your plants a
[SPEAKER_19]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: So what that means is from the bottom of
the plant up, take off all the branches
[SPEAKER_19]: that don't have a useful bud site.
[SPEAKER_19]: The areas that don't look like they're
going to create a chunky bud, just cut
[SPEAKER_19]: those off.
[SPEAKER_19]: About 10 days into flower, you'll know
where you're going to have buds.
[SPEAKER_19]: If the light is not getting to that area,
just pinch that little starter of a bud,
[SPEAKER_19]: just pinch that right off.
[SPEAKER_19]: All those little tiny sucker stems that
are growing off your main stock at the
[SPEAKER_19]: bottom of the plant that are going to make
little shitty flowers that nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_19]: trim, cut that shit off of there and that
will allow that plant to use its energy to
[SPEAKER_19]: produce bigger buds up top.
[SPEAKER_19]: You won't have all that crap on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll get better airflow.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of people say they want to use those
bottom buds for hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's cool if you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're trying to grow buds with bag of
peel, big fatty chunky nuggets,
[SPEAKER_19]: cut that stuff off of there and you will
have better results.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll have better airflow and then you
won't have to trim all that little popcorn
[SPEAKER_19]: crap because that's what sucks at the end.
[SPEAKER_19]: All that just gets chopped up and put into
the hash pile anyway.
[SPEAKER_19]: So do some lolly popping, get in there and
clean all the bottom buds, all the just
[SPEAKER_19]: the bottom crap off the plant before it
even has time to suck up the nutrients and
[SPEAKER_19]: suck up the energy of the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just get that right off of there and allow
that energy to go up to the top.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so let's see something that
people really don't think about that I
[SPEAKER_19]: think could truly benefit the quality of
your garden and the health of your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the overall health of your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's winter time here in Colorado and the
grow room floor is getting cold.
[SPEAKER_19]: My personal grow is in a basement.
[SPEAKER_19]: Something I would recommend to get your
pots up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys get your plants off the ground.
[SPEAKER_19]: A really easy way to do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you can't build something, if you can't
build a table, I would recommend getting
[SPEAKER_19]: like a four by four botanic hair tray and
just build yourself a little table that
[SPEAKER_19]: will support the tray and your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just lift it up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever is comfortable for you,
two to four feet off the ground,
[SPEAKER_19]: usually about 30 inches is the height
people go, 36 inches is kind of high for
[SPEAKER_19]: me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm tall.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't need it that high.
[SPEAKER_19]: So just get your plants up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_19]: The floor is cold.
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't want those cold pots on the cold
floor.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to water them.
[SPEAKER_19]: The water is going to stay in the pot.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got water down there in the root
ball and that water is going to get cold
[SPEAKER_19]: because the floor is so cold when the
lights go off at night.
[SPEAKER_19]: So raise your pots up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to tell you a cheap and
effective way to do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Buy an extra pot.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're running a seven gallon pot and
you've got your plant in there,
[SPEAKER_19]: get yourself another seven gallon pot and
flip it upside down and just set your
[SPEAKER_19]: seven gallon pot right on top of there and
you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's a cheap, effective way to get
your plants up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to look like your plants are
happier just one night of having them up
[SPEAKER_19]: off the ground.
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll grow more quickly.
[SPEAKER_19]: The buds will develop much larger.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll taste better.
[SPEAKER_19]: The plants will act happier.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that cold floor will also describe
disguise itself as a pH or a nutrient
[SPEAKER_19]: problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll be thinking, what's going on with
my crop?
[SPEAKER_19]: Your floor is too cold and your plants are
pissed off.
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't like to get up in the morning
and walk across a cold floor on your bare
[SPEAKER_19]: feet?
[SPEAKER_19]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_19]: So don't make your plants do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get them up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that may help you get them a little
bit closer to the light as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: I may have just put you in danger of
getting too close to the light,
[SPEAKER_19]: but that's something that the trellising
we're going to talk about in another
[SPEAKER_19]: episode will help you out with.
[SPEAKER_19]: So get your plants up off the ground,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in a traffic area, so I can't really
look at my notes right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: So while I'm driving right here,
I'm just going to give a huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass because Hitman Glass sponsors
the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's nothing like taking a fat dab
out of a Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, we're getting out of the
traffic area.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can look down at the phone once again
and see what the next one is.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_19]: Check your PPMs of your solution.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you guys are mixing up your nutrients
to feed your plants, pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_19]: PPMs.
[SPEAKER_19]: PPM stands for particles per million.
[SPEAKER_19]: That will tell you how much stuff is in
the water or the solution that you have
[SPEAKER_19]: created.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you're using reverse osmosis water,
it'll start off at zero PPMs.
[SPEAKER_19]: Most tap water is going to come out fairly
low.
[SPEAKER_19]: The tap water where I am at home comes out
about 400 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_19]: It changes seasonally.
[SPEAKER_19]: They add stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But we're usually about the 400 PPM area.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you know what you're doing,
you can feed them really high.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've gotten into the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_19]: People tell me I'm crazy for feeding my
plants 2000 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm paying very close attention to
what I'm giving them.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not doubling up on anything.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're getting a broad array of nutrients
instead of just getting really heavily
[SPEAKER_19]: blasted with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would recommend that you don't go
much higher than like 1200 PPMs when
[SPEAKER_19]: you're mixing up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_19]: What you can do if you've got a big
reservoir, this is going to be a little
[SPEAKER_19]: harder if you're using a five-gallon
bucket because you don't get as much
[SPEAKER_19]: wiggle room.
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you're using like a 25-gallon res
or a 50-gallon res from the Hydro Shop,
[SPEAKER_19]: fill it up maybe like 40 gallons.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got a 50-gallon res,
fill it up to about 40 gallons.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got a 25, fill it up to about 15
or 20.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then mix your nutrients the way you
normally would.
[SPEAKER_19]: Put your PPM meter in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's going to show you that it's too
high right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: But all you've got to do is just run
normal water or if you've got reverse
[SPEAKER_19]: osmosis water, just add normal,
clean, non-solution mixed water to it
[SPEAKER_19]: until it comes to about 1600 or 1800 PPMs
and feed that to your plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can mix it up and then dilute it until
it's at the right dilution.
[SPEAKER_19]: And everything will be at the right
ratios.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've still mixed the same amount of Grow
A, the same amount of Grow B, the same
[SPEAKER_19]: amount of Cal and Mag.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything will be the same.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just you've kind of diluted it to a
proper solution that your plants are going
[SPEAKER_19]: to love.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then take notes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Feed your plants the solution that was at
1600 PPMs and see how they react.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you think you want to mix it a little
heavier next time and mix it up to 18,
[SPEAKER_19]: feed it to them and see what they do.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't go too heavy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't go past 18.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pay attention to your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think that is something that will
really help you guys out.
[SPEAKER_19]: This guy just passed me on the right,
going about 90 miles an hour, playing on
[SPEAKER_19]: his phone.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't talk too much shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm doing a podcast while I drive.
[SPEAKER_19]: But still, at least put your phone down if
you're going to pass me on the right.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, you guys, I'm coming up on the
Fillmore exit.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to go handle some plants at the
Green and Healthy Wellness Garden.
[SPEAKER_19]: I will be back in the car in just a couple
of hours.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will do more of this podcast and we
will all have a good time.
[SPEAKER_19]: So hang out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's your boy, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just got done putting in about two and a
half or three hours in the grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to fill up some reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got three gigantic reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got a drip system set up to where
every about two and a half hours,
[SPEAKER_19]: the drip system comes on for about a
minute and a half and waters the plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just have to make sure that the
reservoirs are full, that they're filled
[SPEAKER_19]: and they are mixed with nutrients and
properly pHed.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I checked on the clones.
[SPEAKER_19]: The clones look marvelous.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not really good at cutting clones in
rock wool, but this batch is looking
[SPEAKER_19]: pretty nice for me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I checked on all the plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: The plants look glorious.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, today is day two of flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're taking off.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can see that they've already started to
stretch a little tiny bit since yesterday.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that sounds ridiculous,
but they have definitely done some growth.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I checked the tanks.
[SPEAKER_19]: I checked the clones.
[SPEAKER_19]: I checked on all the plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: The plants look happy.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not showing, but I mean,
they're starting the flowering phase now.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I had to tinker with the Gavita
controller.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we got that one.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're working all set up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Those plants are going to be super duper
happy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I'm on the road headed south back to
Pueblo from lovely Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is now dark.
[SPEAKER_19]: The temperature has dropped dramatically.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just now headed past the, which exit
am I at here?
[SPEAKER_19]: The Fort Carson, the Mesa Ridge Parkway,
Fort Carson exit.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're at mile marker 132.
[SPEAKER_19]: None of that is relevant.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just talking because it is what's on
my mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's get back to where we were,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: This episode was about ways, more ways to
improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_19]: We talked about CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_19]: We talked a little bit about trellising.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to talk about trellising for a
second.
[SPEAKER_19]: So trellising, we'll go back to that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Trellising is when you take like a net,
like a five by five net with about either
[SPEAKER_19]: four inch or six inch squares,
spaces between the netting.
[SPEAKER_19]: You got about four inch or six inch holes
in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would take the net and just,
you got to stretch it tight, but build
[SPEAKER_19]: like a five foot frame or attach it to
some poles and just lay that right over
[SPEAKER_19]: the canopy of your plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: While you're in veg, just drop that right
over and pull it tight.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then what I do is I grab the branches
from the plants and I make sure that one
[SPEAKER_19]: branch is sticking through each square of
that trellis.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this will, it'll do a few things.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll separate the plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's where you don't have a bunch of
branches all clumped up into one area,
[SPEAKER_19]: which will allow more of the plant to get
more light.
[SPEAKER_19]: It will also work as a support for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: When the plant starts getting chunky buds
and the plant starts getting taller and
[SPEAKER_19]: stretching, it's going to need some
support.
[SPEAKER_19]: So every branch will be supported by this
trellis.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it'll also spread the plant out.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll give you a little space and it'll
do, it'll create what I call the little
[SPEAKER_19]: grid.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll be able to grow on the grid.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll have more bud sites per square foot
than most people because you have gone and
[SPEAKER_19]: stretched out your canopy and spread it
out in this trellis.
[SPEAKER_19]: So in veg, a couple of weeks before
flower, drop that trellis on and start
[SPEAKER_19]: making the plants grow into the trellis
and get them stretched out the way you
[SPEAKER_19]: want.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I would recommend flowering.
[SPEAKER_19]: Once they're all up through there,
you've got a node coming through every
[SPEAKER_19]: part of the trellis.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're comfortable with the height of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you guys, if something's getting too
high, all you got to do is grab it and
[SPEAKER_19]: bend it down back under that trellis,
and then it'll start growing up again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cannabis wants to grow up.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it'll do.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you bend a branch down and stick it
in that trellis, it will grow itself back
[SPEAKER_19]: up.
[SPEAKER_19]: So after a couple of weeks, you put the
plants in flower after they've vegged into
[SPEAKER_19]: the trellis and grown comfortably.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you put them in flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then just a couple of weeks after
flower, maybe 10 days after flower,
[SPEAKER_19]: I would recommend putting up another
trellis, maybe less than 10 days.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe seven days.
[SPEAKER_19]: Put up another trellis, just about 18
inches higher than that first one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Your plants are going to start budding,
and they're going to grow right into that
[SPEAKER_19]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe 16 inches if you're at a home grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going about 18 inches to give them
some space.
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe 24, just depends on how fast they
grow by then.
[SPEAKER_19]: But you want them to grow up into that
trellis to where those top colas have more
[SPEAKER_19]: space to lean.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to kind of lean on those
trellis wires.
[SPEAKER_19]: So make sure you pull the trellis tight
when you put it up there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get it at the right height to begin with.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pull the branch nodes through that
trellis.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Be careful not to break them.
[SPEAKER_19]: But don't be shy to get in there and just
kind of reshape that plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make it go the direction you want.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then get it growing into that trellis
squares.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then add the other trellis a little
bit into flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then keep the buds growing through
that.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you'll be able to create more bud
sites, more buds, more harvest weight
[SPEAKER_19]: without adding more light or without using
more space in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I find that to be a huge improvement.
[SPEAKER_19]: So something else I want to touch on you
guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a major important factor that
people overlook.
[SPEAKER_19]: They say that cleanliness is next to
godliness.
[SPEAKER_19]: So something that would really improve
your garden, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just clean up after yourselves.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get in the garden and clean up.
[SPEAKER_19]: If it doesn't need to be in there,
take it out of there.
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't need to have the broom and
dustpan in there overnight when you're not
[SPEAKER_19]: using it.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got a trash can in your grow
room, make sure there's a lid on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I would recommend taking that trash can
out of the grow room at night.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't have anything in the room that
doesn't need to be in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Clean up.
[SPEAKER_19]: All that crap in the corner, whatever
you've got over there, if it's your
[SPEAKER_19]: nutrients, if it's your notes,
if it's your gear, clean that up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Take that out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got leaves on the floor,
get those leaves up off the floor.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now here's something I'm going to kind of
contradict myself with, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_19]: really important to have a super clean
grow room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cleanliness will keep bugs away.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cleanliness just helps you keep everything
more organized.
[SPEAKER_19]: It keeps healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: But here's something that I'm going to add
to this.
[SPEAKER_19]: Around week six or seven, your plants are
going to start getting really sticky.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to start producing resin.
[SPEAKER_19]: The trichomes are going to get fat.
[SPEAKER_19]: The plants are going to want to stick to
everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're a girl or a dude with long hair,
you'll notice that every time you walk
[SPEAKER_19]: past the ganja plants, you leave some hair
in them.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're a pot photographer, you'll
notice that every time you try to take a
[SPEAKER_19]: picture, that one killer bud has got a dog
hair or a people hair or a kitty hair or
[SPEAKER_19]: some kind of hair in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: What I'm getting at, you guys,
is these sticky plants love to collect
[SPEAKER_19]: everything.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to give them about 21 to 25
days of straight sticky collection time.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to be sticky for three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_19]: In that whole time, they're acting like
fly paper and just collecting everything
[SPEAKER_19]: that's in that room.
[SPEAKER_19]: My advice to you guys is try to control
the dust that's in the air in your grow
[SPEAKER_19]: room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Try to control the particulates and hair
that are flying around in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Try to minimize all of that stuff because
it's going to stick to your buds and end
[SPEAKER_19]: up in your buds.
[SPEAKER_19]: These days, most of the people in Colorado
and California in a legal state that are
[SPEAKER_19]: producing a grow, at least half of the
grows are being turned into extracts,
[SPEAKER_19]: which means they're being blasted with
butane.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're being turned into water hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're being turned into some sort of
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're in your grow room and you're not
cleaning up after yourself and you're
[SPEAKER_19]: mixing soil for your next batch or
whatever you do in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: You get dust all in the air.
[SPEAKER_19]: You get soil all in the air.
[SPEAKER_19]: All of that shit is going to stick to your
trichomes, all of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you're going to smoke those plants
and they're going to taste like dusty
[SPEAKER_19]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you're going to extract it and make
hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: All that dust and dirt and shit and dog
hair is going to be in your concentrates.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really recommend you keep the grow room
clean.
[SPEAKER_19]: Try to minimize dust and hair in the air.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can get a carbon scrubber.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just throw a tall carbon filter on the
floor, point it straight up, put a blower
[SPEAKER_19]: on top of it, and just put that sucker by
your door, kind of near the door,
[SPEAKER_19]: so that way any air that is drawn in,
any particles will get sucked up by your
[SPEAKER_19]: carbon filter, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also on any intakes going into the room,
I would recommend putting a HEPA filter
[SPEAKER_19]: over all of the holes or all of the
ducting into the room so you're not
[SPEAKER_19]: bringing in crap from outside.
[SPEAKER_19]: I definitely don't recommend bringing in
air from the outside that has not been
[SPEAKER_19]: filtered and treated for temperature.
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now it's the winter.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you were to bring in it's going to be
probably 20-something degrees tonight,
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're running your lights at night and
you bring in that 20-degree air over your
[SPEAKER_19]: plants, you're going to cause powdery
mildew issue.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're bringing in frosty cold air.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're introducing it into a warm grow
room environment.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is a great way to create powdery
mildew situations.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pay attention to what you're bringing in
the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Be clean.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my point, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Every leaf on the floor is a spot for a
bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_19]: Every piece of crap that you've got in
there is another place for a bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a place for a mold spore to start
growing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just be clean.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cleanliness is very important in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's what I've got for you for
ways to improve your garden for now.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to thank you for listening to
another episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think that the car episodes are up
to my quality standards.
[SPEAKER_19]: The sound quality and the amount of
attention I am allowed to give a show
[SPEAKER_19]: doesn't seem like it's fair to the
listener.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am going to probably stop doing the car
episodes.
[SPEAKER_19]: If I do a car episode, it'll just be
something ranty.
[SPEAKER_19]: It won't be something educational or
detailed.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you made it through this episode,
I truly do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be back next week with the Dude It's
Damsel or the Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_19]: Invitational Recap that features the
lovely Dude It's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got Hunt on the mic for a little bit
of that show and four other lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_19]: Our friend Chris from The Clear jumps in
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have that edited and cleaned up and
ready for you guys by next Monday.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got seven days to get that out for you.

[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass, glass made in America by
Americans.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I'm shopping for a rig, I like to
know that what I'm paying for is going to
[SPEAKER_19]: give me a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to get water splashed to my
face.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to get a dry dab because
there's not enough water in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, don't trust a rig that was made
in China by a Chinese kid with no eye
[SPEAKER_19]: protection.
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably wasn't wearing shoes.
[SPEAKER_19]: He didn't get paid enough.
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't buy some glass made in China.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, buy American glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's made by an American.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll make you feel better.

professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_19]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_19]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_19]: for you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_19]: My friends call me Ross the Jeff.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_19]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you

[SPEAKER_19]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope you guys are having a great

[SPEAKER_19]: But if you're smoking a blunt,
more power to you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get it in your head.
[SPEAKER_19]: Get them turps in your mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: Set yourself free.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, this is going to be a great
episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the episode that I recorded in
Colorado Springs from the Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_19]: Invitational.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are a lot of great folks in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: This episode features the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_19]: This episode features Chris from The Clear
Concentrates, and it definitely features a
[SPEAKER_19]: whole bunch of lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_19]: Before we get to that, this podcast is
brought to you by our great friends at
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, today I'm sitting over here
hitting the Hitman Mini Sidecar with the
[SPEAKER_19]: Hammerhead.
[SPEAKER_19]: I grabbed this one because it's got a
yellow label on it, and I haven't seen a
[SPEAKER_19]: lot of Hitman with a yellow label.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thought it looked fresh.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Hammerhead perk in this thing,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my God, this thing hits like a fucking
boss.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to heat this up for a second
here while I'm rambling about Hitman
[SPEAKER_19]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_19]: What else do I have to say?
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm going to heat this up.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to take a fat dab of some
Gorilla.
[SPEAKER_19]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_19]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Gorilla Glue Live Resin from the
Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's take a dab here.
[SPEAKER_19]: But this podcast is brought to you by our
good friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_19]: What I'm shopping for a rig, you guys,
I want a rig that I know is going to hit
[SPEAKER_19]: like a truck.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not going to splash water in my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also want a rig made by an American
in America and not made by some Chinese
[SPEAKER_19]: kid without protective eyewear,
with no shoes, and not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you guys, I represent Hitman Glass by
Glass Made in America.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hitman Glass is a huge part of the
cannabis and hash movement.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you check out www.hitmanglass

[SPEAKER_19]: All right, this nail is hot.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, you guys, I'm nice and turped
out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Big shout out to Hitman.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you guys support the Hitman
crew.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks a lot to Dougie and the entire
Hitman fam.
[SPEAKER_19]: For supporting the podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, I don't have a lot else to say.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's time travel back a few days to
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, it was a lovely, snowy
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_19]: There were a bunch of lovely ladies in the
house.
[SPEAKER_19]: There were a bunch of turpy dudes in the
house.
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a table covered in great food
and good hash and good weed.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was a party.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's let the music take us right into
that part of the episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I'll be back to wrap up the show
after that.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_19]: It's your boy Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am here in beautiful Colorado Springs,
looking out a giant window, looking at a
[SPEAKER_19]: lovely day.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's snowing like a son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's gorgeous out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sitting across from me, you guys,
I am here at the Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_19]: Invitational.
[SPEAKER_19]: And sitting across from me is the lovely
dude, it's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really good and really high.
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds and looks like the weed that I
grew is working for the whole house.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've all been stone silly for four days
now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, our friend Brittany is joining us.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's known as Dude It's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_19]: Her real name is Brittany.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, thanks for being on the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, of course, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_19]: She brought four or five.
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't even count how many lovely ladies
there are.
[SPEAKER_19]: She brought four beautiful model friends
with her.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just going to go from the left and
introduce all the ladies.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sitting to my left is Miss Amanda.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do they call you on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_13]: Ackley Rocks.
[SPEAKER_13]: R-A-W-K-S There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you follow her.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to talk to you a little bit
more later too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Pass the mic for me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you've got a mic.
[SPEAKER_19]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_19]: I give you a mic.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sitting right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm really high too.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just hide it better.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sitting in front of me is my new friend,
Shayna.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I'm just Shayna.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just Shayna?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to have an Instagram?
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to shout out?
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm super good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's a great photographer, you guys.

[SPEAKER_15]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's your Instagram handle so people can

[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, man.

[SPEAKER_19]: How do you spell Renee at the end there?
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it's different.
[SPEAKER_15]: R-E-N-A.
[SPEAKER_15]: Real special.
[SPEAKER_19]: You are special.
[SPEAKER_19]: We like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sitting way to my right-ish is this shy
girl.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we call you Jacqueline?
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we call you Jackie?
[SPEAKER_12]: Jacqueline, please.
[SPEAKER_19]: Jacqueline, please.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's your Instagram, honey?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, my name is underscore Jacqueline.

[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for joining me, ladies.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we're super stoked.
[SPEAKER_19]: Over here, who's got to grab his mic,
blow out his dab, get his shit together,
[SPEAKER_19]: cough a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my buddy, John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going down?
[SPEAKER_19]: Hanging out, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my buddy, the grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the man, the myth, the turp
gatherer, the legend.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for joining me, man.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_17]: I fated, bro.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just took the biggest dab.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I was like, this dude's going
to blow out a dab.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so stupid blowing out right now and
I'm trying to talk without coughing and
hacking.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can cough on this show.
[SPEAKER_19]: This show will be filled with coughs.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's no problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a gorgeous house, a gorgeous
location, some gorgeous friends and
[SPEAKER_19]: family.
[SPEAKER_19]: Also in the room, you guys, we're going to
do another podcast after this and we'll
[SPEAKER_19]: feature these guys, but also in the room,
we got Jordan from TurpX.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got our buddy, Dan, from CCC420.
[SPEAKER_19]: To my left, my new friend, Chris,
from The Clear, The Clear Scientist.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for jumping in.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to do a show with all these
guys here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_19]: We may get the guitar out again,
if you guys remember what happened on that
[SPEAKER_19]: episode.
[SPEAKER_19]: They got a little turp sloppy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we might do that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a bunch of notes here on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_19]: I should probably open that stuff up and
start getting on it.
[SPEAKER_19]: First, before we get too far, I need to
learn a little bit about the Dude It's
[SPEAKER_19]: Gatsby Invitational.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you guys want to tell me all about
that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been organizing these shoot fests for
a few years.
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to do it for a different company
where I would bring a bunch of girls and
[SPEAKER_14]: photographers to different locations and
we would make a whole bunch of art and
[SPEAKER_14]: have a really good time.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was an excuse for all of us to get
together, even though we are spread across
[SPEAKER_14]: the country.
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought, why not do that for cannabis
products and for businesses?
[SPEAKER_14]: I ran the idea past Hunt and he was like,
that could actually happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just an idea.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't it be cool?
[SPEAKER_14]: I really just wanted an excuse to bring my
friends somewhere and watch them run
[SPEAKER_14]: around naked.
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_14]: He said that we could make it a real thing
and lots of hard work and planning and
[SPEAKER_14]: some sort of sweet sponsors later.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of these guys here are teaching me
how to be a boss.
[SPEAKER_19]: You already knew how to be a boss before I
met you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think lifestyle marketing and content
creation in general is something that
[SPEAKER_17]: numerous businesses, whether big or small,
are utilizing in different aspects.
[SPEAKER_17]: With the Gigi Fam and different aspects,
I actually met Damsel at one of those
[SPEAKER_17]: shoots before giving a cannabis class to
the photo shoot and doing some cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: consulting.
[SPEAKER_17]: With the people that are in the room now,
there's a massive imprint and footprint,
[SPEAKER_17]: so to speak, on how social media and
social engineering and lifestyle marketing
[SPEAKER_17]: comes to be very effective.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a double-edged sword with bringing
the right people together, but also
[SPEAKER_17]: getting the right brands together to be
able to represent what Damsel does really
[SPEAKER_17]: well and what we can put together.
[SPEAKER_19]: And what brands were a part of the event
this time?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this the first event you guys have done
like this?
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the first one, the first ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: The first of its kind.
[SPEAKER_17]: So who joined on for this one?
[SPEAKER_17]: I can rattle them off pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_18]: They all deserve a shout out.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have all kinds of different companies
came to be.
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, iReGenetics had a nice part
with some of the stuff we've been putting
[SPEAKER_17]: in the air for the week.
[SPEAKER_17]: Apothecana came through with a bunch of
great holistic topicals that we've been
[SPEAKER_17]: using and also having some great shoots.
[SPEAKER_17]: Turbex is an unbelievable sponsor that not
only has done all this stuff from
[SPEAKER_17]: sponsoring vehicles to other aspects.
[SPEAKER_17]: The clear concentrate as well as their
whole subsidiary of brands.
[SPEAKER_17]: How about that popcorn?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that popcorn from the clear?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I went like a thousand milligrams
deep yesterday.
[SPEAKER_17]: That popcorn.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh man, I slept like an infant.
[SPEAKER_17]: Man, that was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, I think something's moving.
[SPEAKER_17]: I looked and I was like, my hand's on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_17]: How's something moving?
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, wait, that's me just trembling
right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just trembling, just shaking.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so the clear came through here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, Chris coming out in person is a
blessing in general.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just having out the scientists.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, the mats.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mood mats.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, mood mats came through.
[SPEAKER_17]: They sent out a box of rubber that you
could literally like wear as a jacket and
[SPEAKER_17]: stay warm for the whole winter.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, like mats that can cover that
coffee table right there that we're
[SPEAKER_17]: staring at and all kinds of other shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so you know, unbelievable for all
the braids.
[SPEAKER_17]: Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_17]: We had some places there that we shot at
and saw what was going down with that.
[SPEAKER_17]: There are what other ones?
[SPEAKER_17]: All the people that are here, obviously,
all the ladies and their brands.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shout out to all the ladies.
[SPEAKER_14]: A huge success.
[SPEAKER_14]: We brought out a bunch of veteran models
and a veteran photographer and girls that
[SPEAKER_14]: are really used to like pitching in and
doing their share of the work and helping
[SPEAKER_14]: out and we all get along really well.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we know how to work really hard to get
the job done.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was a lot of work and a lot of play
and we just had a, you know, a really
[SPEAKER_14]: great group of girls that are really good
friends spread across the country and when
[SPEAKER_14]: we get together, it's like nothing
changed.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: We keep talking about friends from across
the country.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where is everybody in the room from?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm from LA.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Miss Shana?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm from Boston.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, opposite ends of the country.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Meeting in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_19]: Tristan?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm from Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm from Bellflower.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm from Chicago, but just moved to
Phoenix three months ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_19]: How's that for a change?
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: You get to ride your bike more?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: This young lady rides a Harley and she
looks awesome doing it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to you and your bike.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the things that we really,
so big shout out to the dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's hard for me to remember.
[SPEAKER_19]: The dude, it's Gatsby Invitational.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a lot of words for my stonest to
remember, but shout out for letting me be
[SPEAKER_19]: a part of that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Look, the snow is coming down again.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is such a great view.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to the people that let us use
this house.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, this is a dope house.
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the things that really made this
weekend special, Miss Damsel, actually
[SPEAKER_19]: we're going to blame this mostly on Hunt.
[SPEAKER_19]: A few months ago, Hunt put me in touch
with Miss Damsel and she asked me if I
[SPEAKER_19]: would breed a strain for her.
[SPEAKER_19]: So a lot of what's been going on this
weekend is we have all been smoking what
[SPEAKER_19]: will become or possibly not become from
what the talk has been some things that
[SPEAKER_19]: may become Damsel's dank.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you've got a little notebook in front
of you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you guys decided which is your
favorite and least favorites in such?
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think the overwhelming favorite
is what ladies?
[SPEAKER_14]: The B4.
[SPEAKER_17]: B4.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you describe like an echo in the room?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: So B4 is the winner.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've always had, I mean, judging
competitions and being a part of a lot of
[SPEAKER_17]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, obviously putting you all together
is great stuff for us to all flavor.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a veteran rule in doing this,
but the one that's gone first is always
[SPEAKER_17]: the winner.
[SPEAKER_19]: True.
[SPEAKER_19]: The one that everybody smoked up.
[SPEAKER_19]: B4 was gone first the first time.
[SPEAKER_17]: B4 was gone first this time at the house.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got some more B4 in the car.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have to throw some on the counter
before I leave.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So for the people that didn't get a chance
to smoke it, can you describe what you
[SPEAKER_19]: thought of B4s since you got your notes
right in front of you?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thought it smelled a little bit like
pineapple with a hint of citrus,
[SPEAKER_14]: but the taste was a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was so high when I did this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I drew a campfire and I said it was like a
little bit floral with a hint of birch and
[SPEAKER_14]: then it was naturey.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said it kind of tasted like camping.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it had some nice orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was frosty and yeah, we have been
really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been lots of giggles, lots of good
times.
[SPEAKER_14]: The bitches love B4.
[SPEAKER_19]: The bitches.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I call you guys the bitches for the
length of the show and I'll stop right
[SPEAKER_19]: after?
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I got to look.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked.
[SPEAKER_19]: I got totally denied.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have found my boundary.
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to smoke more B4.
[SPEAKER_19]: You got to smoke more B4.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So did anybody else in the room get a
campfire or tastes like camping aroma?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just curious about that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's kind of a chef.
[SPEAKER_19]: Aren't you a chef?
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've been cooking the entire time I've
been here this is the first time you
[SPEAKER_19]: haven't been cooking.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm taking a break.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you say it does kind of taste like
campfire.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does.
[SPEAKER_19]: In a good way?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause when I think of campfire,
I think like when you go camping and your
[SPEAKER_19]: hair smells like campfire, not like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what kind of dreadlock joke is that
mama?
[SPEAKER_19]: Grab a mic if you're going to talk.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're loud enough to where they kind of
got you, but it hurts you.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So B4, was there a runner up?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I also really enjoyed the A3.
[SPEAKER_18]: A3.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which I thought it smelled like fruity
pebbles, a little bit like black cherry,
[SPEAKER_14]: but it tasted a little more diesel-y,
but that one had super sparkly turps on
[SPEAKER_14]: it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I described the overall high as sway
feels, you know, when you like get super
[SPEAKER_14]: high and you just like start swaying in
the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just kind of leaning.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just kind of leaning.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can't pick where your feet want to go.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: This weighs.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So does anybody want to know what was in
these crosses?
[SPEAKER_19]: I know all the boys in the room are
staring at me.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going, tell me what's in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have been waiting.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: This was fun to mess with everybody.
[SPEAKER_19]: Did anybody try any of the number,
the letter C?
[SPEAKER_19]: Did any of that get tasted?
[SPEAKER_19]: Was that dooky?
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we all agree that was just dooky and I
shouldn't grow that anymore?
[SPEAKER_14]: We just didn't even write anything down.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was no good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why there were three that were from
that selection and I didn't bring them.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the way I did this, I ran, I think I
started with 20 seeds of three different
[SPEAKER_19]: strains and I narrowed it down through the
veg phase and through flower.
[SPEAKER_19]: I ended up with three of letter A and I
just labeled the seeds so that nobody knew
[SPEAKER_19]: what they were.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've just, this is brand A, this is brand
B, this is brand C.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had three of letter A, four of B and
three of C.
[SPEAKER_19]: C's are dooky.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't need that.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's crap.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not even going to grow any more of
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_19]: Throw it all away.
[SPEAKER_19]: A, C was transformer to daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_19]: From Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: Transformers Inferno Haze and Chem D and
then the, what's the other one I said it
[SPEAKER_19]: is?
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I'm lost now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Chem D.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Inferno Haze and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_19]: Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So many genetics in my head that I get
confused, but the winners are- Terp Nerd.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am kind of a Terp Nerd.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_19]: A is space queen crossed a grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_19]: I used a female space queen and a male,
a reversed male grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a feminized seed, but space queen
to grateful dog is what that is.
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's my space queen or my grateful dog
that I made to sub cool space queen.
[SPEAKER_19]: A real tall, stretchy phenotype of the
space queen.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where that fruity, funky moldy
smell comes from is the space queen.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's the Romulan that makes it grow
those orange, real orange pistols.
[SPEAKER_19]: The real fingery calyxes that's from
Romulan.
[SPEAKER_19]: So B, the one that everybody loves.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody's guessed it so many times
accurately.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's lemon skunk from Arian.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's greenhouse seeds, lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Arian's from Lemon Man and then it's
across to the Daybreaker from Gage Green
[SPEAKER_19]: Genetics with the Joseph OG and the Chem D
in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what that one is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lemon skunk and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_19]: It needs a good name if it's- So what I've
heard, you might not decide that this is
[SPEAKER_19]: going to be the keeper.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they were all super,
super good, but I feel like there's just
[SPEAKER_14]: another strain that I compare all of my
highs to and- Don't say the name of it
[SPEAKER_19]: because we're going to keep that secret
and do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we should try to put that in
the mix and maybe do the process over.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, there were so many good- What
was the B one?
[SPEAKER_14]: That was another really, really good one.
[SPEAKER_19]: B one, that's the lemon skunk Daybreaker
cross.
[SPEAKER_19]: So all of the B's will be lemon skunk to
Daybreaker and all of the A's are grateful
[SPEAKER_19]: dog and space queen.
[SPEAKER_19]: And all the C's were trash.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the ones that you guys really liked,
we're going to work on getting those on
[SPEAKER_19]: the shelf at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll take a while.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's the A3.
[SPEAKER_17]: A3, we'll get that there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And B4, I believe.
[SPEAKER_17]: And B4, maybe even B1.
[SPEAKER_17]: B1 was super good.
[SPEAKER_17]: I really liked B1.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the Fino's all came out fantastic.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Terpy boys are across the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: And when I said B1, I got two thumbs ups
on the B1.
[SPEAKER_19]: So there'll be some new stuff showing up
at Green and Healthy Wellness,
[SPEAKER_19]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: That'll be a little bit, be a couple of
harvests, but we'll make it happen.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it all got smoked.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it's fine.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all great.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And kudos to you, brother.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for some nice fire to smoke for
the event.
[SPEAKER_17]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_17]: You made some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: We appreciate all that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've watched all these ladies be really
high, but- When they don't smoke like the
[SPEAKER_19]: Colorado folk do, they come and get
wrecked and it's pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm making fun of you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the Terpy boys have just been
smoking all the B1 and B4 like champions.
[SPEAKER_19]: What'd you write?
[SPEAKER_19]: What are your notes?
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Jacqueline over here, she did her own-
Do they call you Dimples or is it Dampels?
[SPEAKER_14]: She's getting so shy.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Jacqueline did her own notes for the
B4.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was when we smoked it at her
apartment.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was already really high and I was
like, write down how you feel.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just for appearance, she wrote green.
[SPEAKER_14]: Potency, she wrote good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Taste, she wrote tasty.
[SPEAKER_14]: Creative.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were just giggling at her notes.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's all blushing.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's cute.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I have more notes that we could go over
unless anybody has more stuff to say about
[SPEAKER_19]: this weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So talk to us about what's up with that
Fino.
[SPEAKER_17]: How long is B4?
[SPEAKER_17]: How high does it get?
[SPEAKER_17]: What does it yield?
[SPEAKER_19]: So B1 and B, all of the Bs were very,
very similar in growth.
[SPEAKER_19]: You could barely see a difference in them.
[SPEAKER_19]: They kind of stretch.
[SPEAKER_19]: The lemon skunk makes them stretch pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_19]: They grow real dense.
[SPEAKER_19]: They grow real chunky.
[SPEAKER_19]: They could take 70 days.
[SPEAKER_19]: These went 63.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it could have gone another week,
but I was pressed for time.
[SPEAKER_19]: What about the A?
[SPEAKER_19]: The A was done at eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_19]: Finished at eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_19]: One of them started to herm.
[SPEAKER_19]: You could probably see it if you guys are
experienced weed growers.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you got one of the top buds,
you could see herm flowers in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was just starting.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can't work.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't remember which one it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: I took pictures and marked it down in the
photos and stuff, but I don't remember off
[SPEAKER_19]: the top of my head, but I marked down
which one was a herm.
[SPEAKER_19]: That'll have to go.
[SPEAKER_17]: Which one brought in the most?
[SPEAKER_19]: The most flower?
[SPEAKER_19]: B1.
[SPEAKER_19]: B1 brought in just, yeah, there was most
of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're little plants.
[SPEAKER_19]: They harvested about an ounce and a half.
[SPEAKER_19]: B1 was about two and a half ounces.
[SPEAKER_19]: Less.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So B1 is a keeper.
[SPEAKER_19]: We got another Rasta on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's always nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you know what your favorite strain is
basically, Damsel.
[SPEAKER_19]: You figured that out.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to cross something of mine to
that strain.
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of our friends in the room actually
have a clone of your favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to, they've given me
blessings to work with that.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to play with it and we're
going to make you a new strain.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Winnie ladies coming back.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is going to take me, let's see,
120.
[SPEAKER_19]: Give me about a year, honest.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not even shitting.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, because I know what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to get the clone that you want me
to work with.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I'm going to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to make it a boy.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a girl.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to turn it into a boy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to collect pollen from it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I'm going to put pollen on another
clone of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I'm also put pollen on like nine
other bitches in the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we're going to smoke all,
we're going to grow those out and we'll
[SPEAKER_19]: smoke a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like a really good program.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like three harvests pretty much,
right?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Three or four without fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be a minute.
[SPEAKER_17]: Plus I'm carrying.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to have a whole bunch of
stuff growing in.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't rush perfection.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_19]: And we want to find your strain just for
you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: What are we smoking right now?
[SPEAKER_19]: Which one is this?
[SPEAKER_19]: Microphone?
[SPEAKER_15]: B9.
[SPEAKER_19]: B9.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a cotton candy lemon candy taste.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like musky.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very sweet.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the Daybreaker that gives it the
musky.
[SPEAKER_19]: Daybreakers got some real OG Kush
influence to it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out to Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel it's real important to give shout
outs to the people that let me breed with
[SPEAKER_19]: their strains.
[SPEAKER_19]: Gage completely encourages me to work with
his stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: So thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: The whole Gage Green Genetics crew is not
just one person.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a group of people.
[SPEAKER_19]: So have you guys ever done a tasting party
or anything like this before?
No.
[SPEAKER_19]: All the girls said no.
[SPEAKER_19]: All the ladies said no.
[SPEAKER_19]: How about you guys over there?
[SPEAKER_19]: Tasting party.
[SPEAKER_19]: You ever done something like this?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thanks for being involved with it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hunt, Fist Bump for putting me in this
position.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've revealed the winner.
[SPEAKER_19]: I told you what everything is.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wrote this down.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Ms. Amanda, I see you got your phone
over there.
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got a book coming out, a cookbook.
[SPEAKER_19]: You talked about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want me to just cut that part out?
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to give you a chance to shout
out your cookbook.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am finishing a cookbook that I've been
inspired by this trip to quickly finish by
[SPEAKER_13]: the 1st of January.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's your cookbook called?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be called Eat Yourself Thin.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you said it's mostly for women?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be for everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that everyone should know how to
cook clean and simple and on a budget.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_13]: So whether you cook for your boyfriend or
girlfriend or significant other,
[SPEAKER_13]: husband, wife, it's for those people.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you'll have it finished by the end of
the year and then how long to get it out?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll do a Skype interview when it comes
out.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause you've cooked for the house and I
ate some of the leftovers last night and I
[SPEAKER_19]: drove home like a satisfied man.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, that was some good food.
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to make sure to shout out your book.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's also catered to like vegetarian,
soy allergies, dairy allergies,
[SPEAKER_14]: gluten allergies.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we have about five different food
allergies in this house and she's managed
[SPEAKER_14]: to cater to every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_19]: Normally I won't eat at somebody else's
house, but when she was talking to Hunt
[SPEAKER_19]: about his gluten allergy and she said,
there's no egg in this and this,
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, this lady knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I totally trusted eating her food.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for feeding everybody.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was super fun.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I could tell you just live in the
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_19]: You just, you're just comfortable in
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So Britt, what do you do when you're not
being a super model?
[SPEAKER_19]: No, not a super model.
[SPEAKER_19]: I meant a super model, but you know what I
mean.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I am the general manager for green and
healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I, you know, keep, uh, yeah,
I manage.
[SPEAKER_14]: I, uh, I recently started helping out in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a new appreciation for the plant
that I've been smoking for the past 10
[SPEAKER_14]: years because it is a lot of work to make
a little bit of sweaty, got my hair caught
[SPEAKER_14]: in sticky fly traps and, uh, you know,
sore backs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, getting to develop relationships
with them and building that trust.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's definitely where I think,
uh, Oh God, how long have I been in
[SPEAKER_14]: customer service now?
[SPEAKER_14]: How old am I?
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, 13 years of customer service
experience probably serves me,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, while in the front of the house.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, uh, so I do that and, uh,
I have, I'm married and I have a dog and,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, we like to stay home and smoke weed
and, uh, shout out to Puggle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to, to Penelope and Puggle.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sure you follow her on Instagram,
the sweetest dog on IG.
[SPEAKER_14]: She, she's such a diva.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so yeah, it's, uh, you know,
I just, I live the, the weed and Colorado
[SPEAKER_14]: lifestyle and I've been here since,
uh, April.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just, uh, enjoying the,
the altitude and the mountains and welcome
[SPEAKER_19]: home.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: This view here is awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's snowing so perfectly.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys found the greatest spot.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm glad we did a podcast right here.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms. Shayna, can I ask you what you do in
your normal everyday life?
[SPEAKER_19]: When you're not being a model?
[SPEAKER_14]: Photographer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm a photographer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, she's babely enough to be a model
for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Aren't you a model, bro?
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's hear why you aren't the model.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_14]: She retired.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: You retired?
[SPEAKER_19]: You were a model?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, she retired.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not anymore?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: She's the artist.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I bet it's much easier for you ladies
to pose and feel comfortable in front of a
[SPEAKER_19]: lady photographer instead of some creepy
dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: We love shooting with Shayna.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_14]: And with her past experience, she really,
um, you know, shoots each photo to the
[SPEAKER_14]: model's body and she's really good at
directing and, um, yeah, we love working
[SPEAKER_14]: with her.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were, I'm so stoked about all of the
shots that we got from this weekend and
[SPEAKER_14]: we're real stoked to put out the lookbook
cause Shayna killed it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw the unedited shots and the lighting
is great.
[SPEAKER_19]: You made these ladies look great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks guys for providing me with the
stuff I needed.
[SPEAKER_18]: They make it look so weird.
[SPEAKER_18]: So easy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Miss Tristan.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it sounds like we're going to do some
weird phone shoots.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm game.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you normally do in your normal
life?
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, normal life?
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I'm a bartender at night and during
the day I hang out with my dog a lot,
[SPEAKER_16]: smoke a bunch of weed, watch some Netflix
and chill.
[SPEAKER_19]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Miss Shy Girl, I'm going to ask you next.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you do in your normal day to day
life?
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I'm a battle service girl on the
weekends.
[SPEAKER_19]: Where do you do that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, this bar.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're called bar Smith and monarch
theater.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know people are going to stalk you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I might cut that out.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I post on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to post about it too.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I ride my bike and I hike your
motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_18]: Your Harley.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell us a little bit about the Harley.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a 2010, um, 1200 nightster.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my first bike and I've had it for
just about a month now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks good on you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for not being shy for a minute.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, she passed the mic so quickly.
[SPEAKER_19]: You pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_19]: You nailed it though.
[SPEAKER_19]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey Hunt, what are you doing in your
normal life, brother?
[SPEAKER_14]: What doesn't he do besides getting his car
stolen?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't, I don't really have a normal
life.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shout out to the people that stole your
car.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: My star, my car got stolen yesterday
morning.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we talk about the irony of this?
[SPEAKER_17]: You are more than welcome to bring up the
fact that I got paid to be a car thief
[SPEAKER_17]: model for the department of police and DMV
about identity theft and getting your car
[SPEAKER_17]: stolen.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was on every red rock ticket and
every DMV department banner for like a
[SPEAKER_17]: year or so.
[SPEAKER_17]: So how many Facebook and Instagram and
text messages did you get when your car
[SPEAKER_17]: got stolen?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So like five o'clock in the morning,
I started my car or whatever and these
[SPEAKER_17]: guys got it while I was coming out the
front door and I chased them and all this
[SPEAKER_17]: other shit that occurred.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then three or four hours later,
we got our car back.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was a- A double mic in him.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm switching mics on the fly.
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got him on the fly.
[SPEAKER_17]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_17]: So got the car back and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the day yesterday.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, two days ago, whenever it happened on
Thursday, I think I got about like 15 to
[SPEAKER_17]: 20 text messages of some sort of image of
myself as a car thief saying that your car
[SPEAKER_17]: was easy to steal and taking your identity
was even easier.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's one that's like a really big
closeup with me and it just says something
[SPEAKER_17]: about me taking your ID or some shit.
[SPEAKER_17]: So- I'm mad at myself for not making the
first meme of that situation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's all credit to dad back there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the Terpy boys coming through.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Terpy boys pointing over here to
Amanda.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's a 50- I heard you guys
complimenting each other yesterday.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a 50-50.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that all happened yesterday.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't really have much of a regular
life, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I have like my real life is like
grimy gats being four pieces and green and
[SPEAKER_17]: healthy wellness and the growth that,
you know, you and I work at and- Dude,
[SPEAKER_17]: you crushed it in there.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you hired me, you're like,
I don't know how to grow weed,
[SPEAKER_19]: I need you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Bro, you got it under control.
[SPEAKER_19]: I shouldn't tell you that too much because
I mean, I'd be out of a job, but you got
[SPEAKER_19]: it under control, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_17]: We do an all right job over there.
[SPEAKER_17]: We try to keep the Terps coming.
[SPEAKER_17]: You look like you know how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I don't know about a real life yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I get- I sleep from like 11 or 12
until like five in the morning and the
[SPEAKER_17]: rest of the time, as you all know,
my phone's on and we're going.
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys, there's a bed at the shop if
that tells you anything about life.
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a bed at our shop where we grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I've slept in it already.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've only worked there for less than a
month and I've crashed out in that bed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you got to grind as hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_17]: You got to do what you got to do to win
it.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a mattress that I grow in case
that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I feel like we've gone about 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Most people listen for about 35 minutes
before they get burned out.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll put a little intro and an ending at
the end of this show at the start and end.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you ladies have anything you want to
say since you got a microphone in your
[SPEAKER_19]: hand and a chance to say something to the
world?
[SPEAKER_19]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Shout out whenever you need promo.
[SPEAKER_14]: Free the nipple.
[SPEAKER_19]: Free the nipple.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we talk about your little crew?
[SPEAKER_14]: We all agree.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we talk about your crew, like your
gang, the WPC?
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we mention that?
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a bunch of uh-uhs.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of a secret, but use your own
imagination for what you think WPC could
[SPEAKER_14]: stand for.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all we get out of them,
guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, ladies, thanks for letting me invade
your privacy for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate you being on the show.

I think we'll have Weed by Jeff on the
[SPEAKER_17]: shelf, too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

ganja grown by Rasta Jeff.

[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so sorry, all of you people that are
not patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, we'll expand soon and we'll
see you there.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's coming, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Colorado Springs has to wake up and let us
do recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_19]: Smoke turps.
[SPEAKER_19]: Smoke turps every day.
[SPEAKER_19]: Keep it true.
All right.

[SPEAKER_19]: And over here speaking on the phone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Who was on the phone?
[SPEAKER_19]: Why did I say phone?
[SPEAKER_19]: That's how high I am over there on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_19]: The guy that I just met last night.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the guy we call the clear
scientist.
[SPEAKER_19]: My buddy, Chris, how you doing brother?

[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thanks for joining me on the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Here comes a beautiful Miss Damsel
sneaking through.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: And here's a guy I just met today.
[SPEAKER_19]: This guy's name's Brian.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's got a really fantabulous long name.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do they call you my friend?
[SPEAKER_19]: The mad alchemist.
[SPEAKER_19]: The mad alchemist.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have an Instagram that you like
people to stalk you on while they're
[SPEAKER_19]: listening to the show?
[SPEAKER_19]: No.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you're low key.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Kind of like a low key kind of dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear you're into some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we may open the doors to talk about
some of that stuff here in the near
[SPEAKER_19]: future.
[SPEAKER_19]: I do like cool shit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, I hear that you two,
Chris and Brian are like the hash mad
[SPEAKER_19]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_20]: People say that.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of just kind of just the good.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll go ahead and say that.
[SPEAKER_19]: They are, yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I ask about the product that I heard
about?
[SPEAKER_19]: A minute ago, the mother's milk.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I ask you guys about that?
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you ready to talk about that on a
podcast or is that something we have to
[SPEAKER_19]: keep on the down low?
[SPEAKER_10]: We can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to hear about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll reveal what they can.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, if I ask too many questions,
just tell me I'm out of line.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really mostly this guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So water soluble, a hash oil solution.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you can put, you make the solution
to you say, oh, this has got five or 10
[SPEAKER_10]: milligrams per milliliter of solutions.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're going to have a little test
tube or some volumetric flask or something
[SPEAKER_10]: and measure out exactly how many
milligrams you're going to want to get.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's potent and it works at last.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to try it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: We all want to try some of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hunt likes the Dr. Pepper mix.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just going to say I would like to
drop some in my Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear it hits you within like 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_19]: It does.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're sooner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely the 24th.
[SPEAKER_10]: Flavor in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: How long does it last like a normal
edible?
[SPEAKER_10]: Consensus.
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, if you can stay awake long enough,
compare the two.
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you take enough, it lasts a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to testify on this matter?
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to bring to the mic our buddy
Hunt, the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's hanging out in the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's tell us a little bit about what
happens when you have consumed the
[SPEAKER_19]: mother's milk.
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you like this stuff?
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a straight from the teat.
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a smokeless immediate type of effect
where like literally after like three or
[SPEAKER_17]: four sips or like a couple of straws
worth, you can feel it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if the drink is potent enough,
within five to 10 minutes, you're at,
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, pretty much euphoria.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it also can pound itself or some sort
of like multiplier where it's like,
[SPEAKER_17]: if there's 60 milligrams in the cup,
it really feels like 200 milligrams when
[SPEAKER_17]: you drink it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And some batches in the R and D phase were
extremely terp and unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_17]: And other batches have been refined into
perfection.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thanks for your testimony,
kind sir.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you ever want to grab a mic,
just jump in, dude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you're hanging out over there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_19]: Squad up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess the golden question is,
do you bring any of this shit,
[SPEAKER_19]: bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I failed on that front, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know it was coming until a couple
of hours ago.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got over an hour drive home and it's
snowing and it's going to be a bobsled
[SPEAKER_19]: ride getting down this mountain where we
are.
[SPEAKER_19]: This place is beautiful, but getting down
tonight in the dark, dude, how about the
[SPEAKER_19]: deer?
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody else experienced the deer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did experience the deer.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I lived in, I grew up in, I grew up in
Ohio, lived in Colorado here for a couple
[SPEAKER_08]: of years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we lived down here in Colorado
Springs, I mean, I always knew the deers
[SPEAKER_08]: to be pretty damn friendly and fearless,
but this motherfucker was trying to get in
[SPEAKER_08]: on the cipher or some shit.
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause he backed down like eight of us were
sitting around smoking.
[SPEAKER_20]: This fool came over, startled us.
[SPEAKER_20]: We slowly like walked back to the house.
[SPEAKER_20]: He just like literally backed us into a
corner, into the door.
[SPEAKER_20]: We pulled up into the driveway.
[SPEAKER_19]: He stopped in front of the cars and looked
at us like, you got the pass or what?
[SPEAKER_19]: And then he came up to my window,
like 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_19]: He'd look at me in the eye.
[SPEAKER_20]: He'd look at my joint.
[SPEAKER_20]: He'd look at me in the eye again.
[SPEAKER_20]: I dropped the joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: At one point I bent down to put the blunt
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what you bent over for,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You got in charge.
[SPEAKER_09]: He got ready to charge though.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like a four point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice four point, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's like an eight point man.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a big boy.
[SPEAKER_19]: Chris, what was he?
[SPEAKER_19]: He was an eight pointer.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was an eight point buck, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought about wrangling him myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris was going to give him a grapple,
but I was like, Chris, tornado.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said they wanted to grab him by the
horns.
[SPEAKER_19]: One of you guys was serious about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to get him by the horns.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to rattle him.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd love to have seen that.
[SPEAKER_09]: If he comes back tonight, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know jujitsu, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to get him.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can play the spoons and the washboard
too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Jujitsu don't work on deer, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's what she says.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I even ask you about the clear?
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I allowed to ask?
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you want to know?
[SPEAKER_19]: What can you tell me about the clear?
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of my listeners, this is listened to
by people from all over the world,
[SPEAKER_19]: not just people in Colorado or Cali that
know what's up.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of the people listening have a hard
time finding pot.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the clear, if you just want to tell
them, they probably know about shattering
[SPEAKER_19]: basic hashes from listening, but if you
want to give them an update on what the
[SPEAKER_19]: clear actually is, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_20]: Clear is a brand of product that we
started a couple years ago in California.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the first popularized and purified
cannabis oil that we coined the name Clear
[SPEAKER_20]: because it was always a nice high clarity.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're one of the first quote solvent free
companies that existed.
[SPEAKER_20]: People have their own ways of making these
activated cannabinoids decolorized and
[SPEAKER_20]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we don't really speak to how we do it.
[SPEAKER_20]: We'd like to just keep it always a secret.
[SPEAKER_20]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_20]: Other people do it and tell you how they
do it.
[SPEAKER_20]: But as far as us, we kind of stick to just
a purification method and we have our own
[SPEAKER_20]: particulars as to what machines we use.
[SPEAKER_20]: We build a lot of our own machines and
have our own processes and things like
[SPEAKER_20]: that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So kind of just particulars and we have
our own like unique flavors that we then
[SPEAKER_20]: blend back in and all natural flavors that
can range from cannabis type flavors that
[SPEAKER_20]: have high terpene content to like,
you know, your standard strawberry or
[SPEAKER_20]: grape.
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, we have sort of a flavor
department that we, you know, pump out
[SPEAKER_20]: different flavors and try to keep the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_19]: Are those flavors derived from cannabis or
other products?
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're all derived from other
products.
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything's natural and none of them are
like, you know, for instance, the terpenes
[SPEAKER_20]: that we use are steam distilled and all
the flavors we use are, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: high grade and are all, you know,
based off of like, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_20]: essential oils and, you know, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have, you know, Chinese things and
we try to make sure that these are like
[SPEAKER_20]: the highest grade stuff, nothing Chinese
sources.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've talked to you for a couple of nights
and I trust you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I trust your judgment on that kind of
product so far.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, you know, there's a lot of,
you know, great uses for products like
[SPEAKER_20]: this.
[SPEAKER_20]: We can use them for topicals and edible.
[SPEAKER_20]: And vapor cartridges and anything you can
really want to, you know, formulate.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's kind of cool.
Right.
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear a lot of good things about the
clear.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have to get our hands on some hunt,
hunt.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's your department.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's out there.
[SPEAKER_19]: A few people that have it as just in
Denver, not in the Springs yet.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I got to drive to Denver to get it.
[SPEAKER_20]: We are slowly making our, our distribution
through Colorado, bigger and wider.
[SPEAKER_19]: So greener green and healthy wellness is
interested, I think.
[SPEAKER_19]: To put that together.
[SPEAKER_19]: The boss is behind me laughing.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's like, Hey, wait, how can you say
that?
[SPEAKER_19]: You do the grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll do the managing.
[SPEAKER_19]: You shut your face.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Jordan, what's up with Terpex,
bro?
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey dude, thanks for the update on the
clear.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_19]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's up with the Terpex brother?
[SPEAKER_08]: We are, you know, we're doing recreational
processing up in Denver right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still doing medical processing down
here in Colorado Springs and have a pretty
[SPEAKER_08]: large grow that is about to be up and
running.
[SPEAKER_08]: For our medical wholesale.
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to have a lot of really awesome
flavors that we're going to be making out
[SPEAKER_08]: of there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything that gets grown in that
facility has to be extracted.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we'll have a lot of really,
really awesome Terps on the market.
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to be extracted.
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to be extracted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing wrong with Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Full plant run.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then also, you know, it's going to be a
pretty exciting month.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going out to Illinois in the middle
of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: month and we are doing some consulting out
there with one of the first operators to
[SPEAKER_08]: get up and running for medical cannabis in
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be going out there to
extract their crop and, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: help get their processing operation going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Help them with some of the, you know,
processing preparation, trimming and all
[SPEAKER_08]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_19]: Expand the brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not, that's not really a brand
situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the market in Illinois is very
small.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more of like a consultation help,
you know, kind of do like a co-brand
[SPEAKER_08]: private label type situation where we go
out there and help create their brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is, you know, one of the first,
you know, they'll have some of the first
[SPEAKER_08]: infused products available in the Illinois
medical cannabis market and probably,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, be some of the first legal
butane extractions to be done in that
[SPEAKER_08]: state.
[SPEAKER_08]: If not the first, we're also going to be
getting up and running in Las Vegas within
[SPEAKER_08]: the next month.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which should also be very exciting.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that'll be right about when this comes
out.
[SPEAKER_19]: This will probably come out in about two
or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that'll be right when this drops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, hopefully that will be right
around the time around the first of the
[SPEAKER_08]: year where we're getting up and running in
Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be, you know, Turpex branded
products that we're going to be,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, selling wax, shatter,
vape pens, things like that throughout the
[SPEAKER_08]: Las Vegas market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our, you know, we originally came out here
from California and it'll be pretty
[SPEAKER_08]: awesome because now California patients
will have access to the product.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what we're going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to be selling wax,
shatter, vape pens, things like that
throughout the Las Vegas market.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to be selling wax,
shatter, vape pens, things like that
[SPEAKER_08]: throughout the Las Vegas market.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's, we, you know, we,
we take pretty, we take pretty good steps
[SPEAKER_08]: in the grow to make sure that,
you know, we have, you know, really high
[SPEAKER_08]: quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wish we were able to let people,
you know, experience the flowers,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the fact that we can take all that
high quality flower product and turn it
[SPEAKER_08]: into extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we want to get as much of that
branded Turpex awesome, Nugrun flavor on
[SPEAKER_08]: the market as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would say most of that product will
be sold as smokeable oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we start delving into other products,
and find that, you know, it's more
[SPEAKER_08]: beneficial to do things that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, maybe we're working to that now,
but right now the plan is to just make
[SPEAKER_08]: shatter wax, live resin, maybe some bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want to talk about live resin for a
minute?
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard you say something to a client
earlier.
[SPEAKER_19]: The bottom line, bro, what makes it live
resin and what doesn't?
[SPEAKER_19]: Just so it's, I've said this on the show
and people call me a hater.
[SPEAKER_19]: What makes it live resin?
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that it's a live plant that's cut
down and then frozen before it is dried.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then what machine do you run it
through?
[SPEAKER_08]: We use an Emotec at our Colorado
operations, as well as the ones that we'll
[SPEAKER_08]: use in Nevada and Illinois.
[SPEAKER_19]: See guys, I didn't even say it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't bait him.
[SPEAKER_19]: We just let him say his thing and he
backed up everything I have said.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_20]: So what the question really comes down to,
there are some like little small
[SPEAKER_20]: distinctions in like live resin.
[SPEAKER_20]: Some people will dry like a slight bit and
then freeze versus like a full dry.
[SPEAKER_20]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you consider that?
[SPEAKER_20]: Any drying, you think it's the immediate
cut and freeze?
[SPEAKER_20]: Cause some people complain about like
tubes clogging up with water and doing,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, fucked up shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would say live resin is really
not meant for a tube, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: The live resin process, I just,
you know, because of the way everything
[SPEAKER_08]: gets clogged and everything like that,
I just would never recommend doing it in a
tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the same steps as like fresh
frozen ice water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead though, you just blast it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So if I do it through like a sweet leaf,
am I still making live resin?
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it going to come out the same?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think theoretically it wouldn't matter.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, you know what machine you use,
it's kind of like a style, right?
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of like the fact that the plant
has not had a chance to dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the machine's just another
variable that you just got to compensate
[SPEAKER_08]: for to try to get the end product that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if the machine operates a little
bit differently, you just, if you have the
[SPEAKER_08]: experience, you figure it out,
adjust it, try to compensate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make, you know, it's a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't really think,
you know, live resin is, what do you guys
[SPEAKER_20]: prefer as far as like type of now grown,
cured, fresh, dried, fresh, dried.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's certain strains that come out
amazing as live resin that, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: really tastes awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think those are, it's like the tangy
tangies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like tangy lemon, like all those ones
taste amazing as live resin, but all of
[SPEAKER_08]: those tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dry, cured too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the main reason why people like
live resin so much is because it,
[SPEAKER_08]: the color.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it brings out a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: But certain types of flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certain flavors get, get muted down by
like this kind of watery thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's planty, it's vegetative.
[SPEAKER_08]: But certain strains in live resin,
the turps are amplified and other strains
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like it takes, yeah, other strains
I feel like it takes like a nice like dry
[SPEAKER_08]: and cure to really bring out the turps to
their like maximum potential.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when that happens, the oil is not
going to be as aesthetically pleasing as
[SPEAKER_08]: if it's cut down early, frozen and
extracted in that form.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's going to look this yellow.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I've learned to take the plants a
little bit early if I know they're going
[SPEAKER_19]: to be oil.
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes it look so much better.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely a, definitely a tactic
that a lot of growers use.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: These days.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to go around the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's your favorite strain to smoke as a
flower and favorite to dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just talking to Chris about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite was always the SFVOG and I
haven't had it in quite some time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's my, that's the ultimate in
flower and dab form.
[SPEAKER_19]: The San Fernando Valley OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to, I'm going to, if I ask a
lot of people, if I asked a hundred
[SPEAKER_19]: people, I bet 50 of them would say the
SFVOG.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: And probably 40 of them didn't smoke the
real one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I have.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure you have.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know who you are, brother.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Chris is thinking about it already.
[SPEAKER_19]: You want us to skip you for a second?
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Brian, favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like smoking a Jack Herrera
flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And really any, any African sativa.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I just love the, like the dirt and
poison, the snow cap.
[SPEAKER_10]: He likes to get shit done.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just- Nigerian nightmare type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: All those guys, they just have that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's turpentine is a common
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_10]: There isn't really a high prevalence and I
just, I really like those.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get up and do things during your day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I love to dab that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love to smoke that on flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, when it's done right,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be done so well.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to assume that turpentine is a
turpenoid.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris, Chris wants to talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to hear about it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Turpentine is one of the isomers of
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe it's gamma.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that has a very distinct smell and is
attributed to like the Jack and XJ type
[SPEAKER_20]: smells.
[SPEAKER_20]: And a lot of times it can be a very like
overpowering note in like a lemon haze or
[SPEAKER_20]: a silver haze or something like that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Very fairly common in like hybridized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_20]: Sativas.
[SPEAKER_20]: But very distinct.
[SPEAKER_20]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: Dutch treat in there as well.
[SPEAKER_20]: You can really, that's, I think like if
you're going to get into turpentines,
[SPEAKER_20]: that's when you're going to be able to
pick up more than, more than most.
[SPEAKER_20]: Most people are going to identify that
because it stands a little different than
[SPEAKER_20]: most of the turpentines.
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit less spicy, a little bit more
sweet.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your favorite strain,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to let him hesitate for a
second.
[SPEAKER_20]: Your favorite strain, bro?
[SPEAKER_20]: I've always been fixated on like that old,
old school blueberry.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just that.
[SPEAKER_20]: We were talking about that last night.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: That DJ Short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_20]: DJ Short style.
[SPEAKER_20]: And is that flower or dab?
[SPEAKER_20]: That's going to be flower.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the dab, we fell in love with
this lemon strain we got that we call
[SPEAKER_20]: lemon grab.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we got it was apparently, you know,
just passed down through a number of
[SPEAKER_20]: people through the home we had at Orem
Farms up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was apparently some 20 year old
lemon from Soma.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is just a killer strain.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just makes this like just intense
lemon and has none of the turpentine
[SPEAKER_20]: taste.
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a lot different than,
you know, the common lemons.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we talked about yesterday,
much different than, no tangy notes,
[SPEAKER_20]: no, no, what was that lemon we were
talking about?
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all you my friend, heavy breather.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't figure who was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean a good perp, you know, granddaddy
perp.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granddaddy perp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that flower and dabbers?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a flower, you know, just blunt
swisher sweets.
[SPEAKER_08]: A granddaddy perp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Call it a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, granddaddy perp is probably
a favorite, but you know, mainly more,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, I really love OG, a good OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: G cut OG is my particular favorite kind of
OG.
[SPEAKER_20]: God, it's almost like everyone.
[SPEAKER_20]: How can you hate OGs?
[SPEAKER_20]: I think everyone loves OGs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been going really heavy on like some
Chem Ds and Chem 91s lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like those a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, mainly, you know, G cut OG,
flower dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll cook it up from time to time.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a unique thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll get burned out if there's too much
cookies.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been smoking a lot of Gorilla Glue
lately.
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't have that distinct,
you know, like a good Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_20]: Man, that's got like, you smell that with
your eyes closed.
[SPEAKER_20]: You smell the different notes.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's got the distinct.
[SPEAKER_08]: Break it up and you get a little something
different, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you guys compared the Gorilla Glue
number fours with the S1s?
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a couple packs of the S1s that we
got from the Home Ain't a Non-Profit out
[SPEAKER_08]: in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have not popped those just yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we've got this new warehouse
firing off, I think we're going to check
[SPEAKER_08]: them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have the cut of the GG4.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it'll be able to do a pretty
nice little side-by-side comparison.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've grown a ton of GG4, so I'll be able
to recognize it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're talking about the Granddaddy
Purple and I said it's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to kind of diss your strain
here, but then I've got the two guys in
[SPEAKER_19]: the room that are going to be able to
explain to me why I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: When I smoke Granddaddy Perps,
no matter, and it's a lot of purple buds,
[SPEAKER_19]: do this to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: When they're dried and cured, they taste
like they're still wet.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that, have you experienced that or does
that make sense to you?
[SPEAKER_19]: That it tastes like there's moisture in
the bud or I don't like the flavor of
[SPEAKER_19]: Granddaddy Perps.
[SPEAKER_20]: The moisture content shouldn't be
affected.
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this probably not going to be a
moisture thing like directly?
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't think it's actually moisture.
[SPEAKER_19]: It just tastes like wetness or tastes like
moisture or something.
[SPEAKER_20]: It just tastes like sweet top notes.
[SPEAKER_20]: So a lot of these, like the Perps and like
floral, these are different sort of like
[SPEAKER_20]: floral top notes, terpenoids, things that
are like a little bit less like
[SPEAKER_20]: elucidated.
[SPEAKER_20]: I would think you link to cannabis,
like sort of spectrum relative to like the
[SPEAKER_20]: simple terpenes.
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, you've got like a situation
where like how they age and how they
[SPEAKER_20]: oxidize is kind of dependent, right?
[SPEAKER_20]: And so you may get that effect.
[SPEAKER_20]: Some people might identify that as like a
fresh as fuck smelling.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's almost what it tastes like
every time, even when it's dried.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Granddaddy Perps is a fickle
lady.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that real deal Urkel that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purple Urkel?
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you know, there's different phenos
and cuts and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like there's definitely one that's
like a little bit heavier on like the
[SPEAKER_08]: cardboard terps, which may be kind of what
you're talking about a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of smells like maybe it was cured
in a wet, in a brown paper bag and left in
[SPEAKER_08]: there a little bit too long.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good kind of GDP as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said though, I don't know where
you're getting a lot of your GDP from,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you know.
True dat.
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I said true dat.
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, it's all purple bloods in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_19]: Was this GDP you were growing or was this
GDP?
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I've never grown it because I've
never been a fan since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, GDP was a hugely mass produced
strain out of California for quite some
[SPEAKER_08]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And was one of the, you know, you know,
was one of the earlier ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: High price, massive commercial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Massive commercial style grow warehouses
where they're sending it across the
[SPEAKER_08]: country.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, people wanted it all over.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cure wasn't really part of the
equation in those big, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: cross contract ones.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys can give me a good cut of the
granddaddy perps.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll grow the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll trim it myself.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll cure it.
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll like it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Super frosty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granddaddy perp done right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody in Colorado, California.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the thing is too, we got purple
leaves, not purple trichomes, if I'm not
[SPEAKER_20]: mistaken.
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't one of those, you know,
a lot of people making these to get the
[SPEAKER_20]: different color bubble coming out.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm pretty sure, if I'm not mistaken,
those make mostly purple leaves,
[SPEAKER_20]: right?
[SPEAKER_20]: Not in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, granddaddy perp, depending on how
it's done, you can have green grapes,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: The black cherry kim.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, go for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_19]: I talk a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say green grapes are
my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the purple leaves, but the green
buds, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: The black cherry kim is well known for its
purple but one of those green phenotypes
[SPEAKER_19]: is amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's one of the keepers.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my only, and it's way out of the
purple range is that black cherry kim.
[SPEAKER_19]: It grows purple, but it doesn't taste like
anything else purple.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, I wanted to ask, what happened to,
why did the original Turpex Instagram get
[SPEAKER_19]: the kibosh?
[SPEAKER_19]: What happened there?
[SPEAKER_19]: What'd you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: The suits came in and said, it's time to
clean it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you guys are, you guys are going
too hard and we're going to just have to
[SPEAKER_08]: slow you down.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many followers was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: 30,000.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you have now?
[SPEAKER_08]: 1,500.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's painful.
[SPEAKER_08]: A few weeks.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they shut me down.
[SPEAKER_20]: They've been going hard on people.
[SPEAKER_20]: People who don't even like really sell
anything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We even got so far as to get a hold of
somebody over there and they, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: told us, can have certain information on
there that we had on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: What information?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you help anyone out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Contact information basically.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any form of contact information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Any sort of pricing information.
[SPEAKER_02]: No contact.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm opening my Instagram right now to see
if I've got contact info on there because
[SPEAKER_19]: they shut me down at 50, I was at 19 K and
I'm at like 1500 and I feel dumb.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's make a song about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's do it about Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, there's all kinds of
people on your shit who are selling mean
[SPEAKER_08]: and X on their pages.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should really be worried about them
and not us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to post pictures of cool weed
and slabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really not so bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you take our page?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you take Jeff's page away?
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish Instagram would focus on all the
people who are selling crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: DM me for info.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: DM me for info.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got lean.
[SPEAKER_08]: DM me for info.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get you whatever you need.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instagram, we're coming for you and we're
not taking no for an answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will post pictures of our slabs and our
glass and our weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you indeed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to post freely.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the Instagram song, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you guys have a band name or are you
just the Derpy boys?
[SPEAKER_08]: We are Doc Butthole and the Brown Eyes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Doc Butthole and the Brown Eyes.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a great segue.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I think what has been demanded,
Ms. Damsel just walked by and wanted to
[SPEAKER_19]: hear the Butthole song.
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there such a thing as the Butthole song
that happens between you two?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily the Butthole song.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just kind of a variety, a multitude
of multi-platinum tracks.
[SPEAKER_18]: What would it take to get you boys to riff
a little bit of the Butthole riff here on
[SPEAKER_18]: the show for me?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would probably take those five
Buttholes that are downstairs coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we might have to pause real quick and
come back once we get the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be paused for a long time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Why don't you just start strumming a
Butthole riff and we'll see if we can
[SPEAKER_19]: tempt this young man to sing some Butthole
jams for us.
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we go, ladies and gentlemen,
Butthole Jam volume one.
[SPEAKER_19]: Live on the Girl From Your Heart podcast
brought to you by Dan and Jordan.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are growing from our hearts right now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, follow them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what you guys tuned in for.
[SPEAKER_20]: Your life is less important than this
song.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's highly inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_08]: That you just wanted to maybe paint a
picture of it and maybe do some other
[SPEAKER_08]: things as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like putting your tongue in the butthole.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know that we like to lick lots
of butthole.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes so sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes kind of like a coconut meat.
[SPEAKER_19]: More recently than I care to admit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Butthole tips.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure she will fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: It shines like a diamond when you're done
because it's so damn clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I don't lick it for a while,
I get mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta blow off some steam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know my favorite strain is blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue dream kinda tastes like a stripper's
ass crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am pining.
[SPEAKER_08]: Strippers love blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: Strippers love blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's one thing I know in my years in
this game.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue dream makes strippers go insane.
Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some glitter on your butthole.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are smoking that stripper's delight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pining.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_19]: You heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_19]: The butthole song.
[SPEAKER_08]: Segwayed into a little bit of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't heard that performed in at least
as long as I've been alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as he's been a part of R&K.
[SPEAKER_20]: I heard Jimmy played that back in 1984.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking Jimmy man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude fucking Jimmy fucking kills it man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jimmy Garcia man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah I heard he's better than Trey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way better man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright so we've gone a long time and I
want to reward my listeners.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone that's made it through the
butthole song.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's made it through the shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's talk about Hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got some amazing Hash artists here
in the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone's nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're all comfortable.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're all friends now.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's coming up with Hash?
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going to be next?
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got Clear Hash.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got dissolvable THC.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone wants the Terps.
[SPEAKER_20]: Everyone's talking Terps.
[SPEAKER_20]: Everyone talks Terps.
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't even know what Terps means.
[SPEAKER_20]: Terps being flavor.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to call it flavor components.
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's a lot going on with terpenes
and a lot of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_20]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think I've got some people out there
doing some little terpene isolates and
[SPEAKER_20]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think the game is going to be sort
of just keeping the essence of cannabis so
[SPEAKER_20]: that everyone can experience it in all the
different formulations.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of more of an art than
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_20]: They're a little bit more stable.
[SPEAKER_20]: Flavors are kind of like an art.
[SPEAKER_20]: Perfumers and people who do that sort of
extraction have been doing it for a long
[SPEAKER_20]: time and have a lot of their own methods.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think cannabis hasn't quite matured to
that level of science and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_20]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've just now been given the freedom.
[SPEAKER_19]: We were prohibited from doing that
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright so you feel like Terps are next.
[SPEAKER_19]: You look like you've got something
important to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say yeah, Terps are good.
[SPEAKER_10]: We definitely have not been inhibited in
doing that because those are all legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so some people have been doing some
research on terpenes for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: Aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people poo poo on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's definitely real.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the cannabis game we see that
that's real because it's one of the things
[SPEAKER_10]: that gets us either way that we want to.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely real and so incorporating
that in the cannabis is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keeping that original essence and so
coming up with the different extractions
[SPEAKER_10]: and trying to get just the terpenes and
then get plants that produce a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's pretty neat information out there
and theories on how you can influence the
[SPEAKER_10]: terpene levels by soil management and
environmental controls and stuff like
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't the only industry where
terpenes are prevalent or where people
[SPEAKER_10]: want the terpenes from what we're growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of literature out there
about different lavender oil, rosehip oil,
[SPEAKER_10]: all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to be able to extract those.
[SPEAKER_10]: Super efficiently and so you can look at
some of these other industries and follow
[SPEAKER_10]: their lead on how to better extract the
stuff that you want in an environmentally
[SPEAKER_10]: friendly and easy way.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's definitely big and that's going
to be a big part of the future probably.
[SPEAKER_19]: You said that environmental factors play a
lot into my terpenoids and my soil.
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you're more on the hash side than
you are the grow game from what I
[SPEAKER_19]: understand about you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Could you give myself and my listeners one
hint on how we could improve our terps in
[SPEAKER_19]: our garden?
[SPEAKER_19]: One thing that we could just stop doing or
start doing that would correct our terps?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got that paper in the car and I
haven't read it yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I printed it out before I drove down here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe the next podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, you heard it here.
[SPEAKER_19]: He's going to read that and find out.
[SPEAKER_19]: You look like you got something to say,
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's up with rosin, bro?
[SPEAKER_19]: What's up with rosin, bro?
[SPEAKER_19]: Triple threat.
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of my friends listen to this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've tasted one person's rosin that I
liked.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything else tastes like burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of the burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had one guy, my buddy Tim came through
and he had some properly made rosin.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he made it himself.
[SPEAKER_19]: He was the only one who had rosin that I
liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that low temp?
[SPEAKER_20]: Low temp, high pressure rosin from sift,
get away from the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't want that shit.
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't want the cuticle waxes.
[SPEAKER_20]: You want what's in the heads anyway.
[SPEAKER_20]: Why are you pressing it through all the
stuff?
[SPEAKER_20]: Even if you did like a half efficient dry
sift or any kind of other sifts,
[SPEAKER_20]: it gets you away from that bulk of the
plant material and that's going to
[SPEAKER_20]: increase your resin quality.
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to get a lot less of the
resin stuck in the plant material and
[SPEAKER_20]: overall just going to be more of a
pleasant experience.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just kind of come up with a reasonable
sift, dry ice sift, or if you can keep the
[SPEAKER_20]: moisture away.
[SPEAKER_20]: People are building out cold rooms,
going the full length.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you can break that material down,
get away from all that leaf, there it is.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh man, that's a lot of work for a home
grower sometimes.
[SPEAKER_19]: What's the most recommended way of getting
some dry sift out of that to work it into
[SPEAKER_19]: rosin?
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you can just kind of promptly
break down.
[SPEAKER_20]: They got rotat machines.
[SPEAKER_20]: They've got ways of saving material that
are pretty efficient if you just go about
[SPEAKER_20]: it the right way.
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I rosin my keef?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, I see a bunch of head nods.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Done that.
[SPEAKER_19]: How'd that come out?
[SPEAKER_19]: Did it taste like burnt popcorn or since
we didn't use plant matter, did it taste
[SPEAKER_19]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it definitely tastes better than
what comes out of the flour.
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, shit in, shit out is a classic
and always the truth when it comes to any
[SPEAKER_20]: process.
[SPEAKER_20]: True, very true.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the truth of tash making.
[SPEAKER_19]: What should I be doing with my reclaim?
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a drop down that's probably got-
Throwing it away.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just throw it away?
[SPEAKER_20]: Just toss it?
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll process that for you for six to $12 a
gram.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_20]: You keep it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't throw anything out, you know.
[SPEAKER_20]: Put it in your oven.
[SPEAKER_20]: Put it in your oven.
[SPEAKER_20]: Heat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_20]: Make it into CBN.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_19]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_19]: Heat it up.
[SPEAKER_19]: Make it in and then just dab it again or
make edibles with it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dab it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Eat it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do whatever.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dab it or eat it.
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.
[SPEAKER_20]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_20]: Dabbing it will have very little
psychoactivity, but you'll probably find a
[SPEAKER_20]: calming sleepy time effect from it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a video going and they said,
can we season our nails with reclaim?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Why couldn't you, bro?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you totally could.
[SPEAKER_19]: Season that nail.
[SPEAKER_20]: Or if your buddy, if you're kind of like
upset with your buddy, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: take some of his like oil and just kind of
use it to like clean it in, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: making your nail.
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe it brings the flame in.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's got boo-boos.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's got butane in it.
[SPEAKER_20]: When he's not looking, toss it on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I've seen recently regarding to
the rosin thing, just jump back to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a picture on the internet the other
day of someone who had smashed their
[SPEAKER_08]: fingers in the pneumatic.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a girl because there's girl
fingernails on the remaining fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were trying to press rosin in one of
those super low temp, high pressure
[SPEAKER_08]: situations and didn't get their fingers
out of the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was not a pretty sight.
[SPEAKER_19]: It looked like you ran over a banana.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_19]: It looked like you microwaved a hot dog.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was just, yeah, that was a mess.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful rosin in the home out there,
kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of you guys are using, you stole your
girlfriend's hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not using a hydraulic press or
anything.
[SPEAKER_20]: To be fair, that as goofy and stupid as it
works is pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got no hatred on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, the best rosin I've tried was
from actually flour and a hair
[SPEAKER_02]: straightener.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time we tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that from, the Gorilla Glue?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember your rosin virginity,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the thing we're going to run into
too, just like any of these other
[SPEAKER_20]: extracts, is that with some plants will be
better suited for turpentine extraction.
[SPEAKER_20]: Some plants will be better for like BHO.
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_20]: Some plants will be better for rosin.
[SPEAKER_20]: You get to certain heats and tend shit
with certain turpentines and albino and
[SPEAKER_20]: certain ones are fine.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it's a matter of like,
where do these, if it's all going towards
[SPEAKER_20]: oil, then there's five or six ways to make
oil and that's going to leave different
[SPEAKER_20]: spectrums of which plants get turned in.
[SPEAKER_20]: The GDP, maybe it gets pressed and doesn't
taste like so.
Right.
[SPEAKER_20]: So whatever, or maybe it's like you really
taste better when you get it first.
[SPEAKER_20]: All open possibilities.
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the way you think, my friend.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we got to get some GDP and press it
and then blast it and then make bubble out
[SPEAKER_19]: of it and see if we can convince me that I
like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's best in flower form though.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, let's get it.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll grow it.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_19]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_19]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're in agreeance with that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just call me on over.
[SPEAKER_19]: Call me over.
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_19]: Our listeners have probably checked out
around the butthole song.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I hope a lot of people enjoyed that
extra bonus hash talk.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're paying attention, that's your
bonus.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a big shout out to you because
these guys are, I've got some of the hash
[SPEAKER_19]: mad scientists, the forefront hash guys in
the room here.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I would have been more prepared,
but I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_19]: These cats are even going to be here.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for being on the show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for sharing the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for turpin' out with me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Chris looks like he's got more stuff
brewing up.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you've got more knowledge you want to
drop on these listeners, bro, I will never
[SPEAKER_19]: stop you.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll put a spotlight on you.
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll give you a microphone.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it's time to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you guys like to wrap us up with
another song?
[SPEAKER_19]: Would that be possible?
[SPEAKER_08]: Got a topic for us, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's just do some dab talk and some
growing from your heart and maybe talk
[SPEAKER_19]: about boobs a little.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.
[SPEAKER_19]: While you guys start the riffing,
I'm going to say thanks everybody for
[SPEAKER_19]: joining me.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate everybody for being on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys on Periscope, I'm going to close
the video.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's just leave it on so you guys can
hear the song.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to point it over at this guy.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can hear his song.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for joining me, playing guitar.
[SPEAKER_19]: Fist bump, bro, before you get going.
[SPEAKER_19]: Mental fist bump from across the room.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_19]: Follow the Clear Scientist.
[SPEAKER_19]: Made a new friend in Brian tonight.
[SPEAKER_19]: Learned a lot of great shit from you
already.
[SPEAKER_19]: Cannot wait to try the Mother's Milk,
water soluble THC that won't taste like
[SPEAKER_19]: anything.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can just cause me all day.
[SPEAKER_19]: I could use an app sometimes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then of course, Jordan, thanks for coming
on the show and singing.
Anytime.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're my favorite choir boy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got to take what the Lord gave you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Which Lord is that?
[SPEAKER_19]: The Jewish one.
[SPEAKER_19]: The Jewish one, yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wasn't going to go there.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to let these guys sing a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: A little song when they wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_19]: I will be back to wrap up the show and say
goodbye in the official way.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to set my microphone down and
take a dab and enjoy the song.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for having us, man.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh dude, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate the hash knowledge.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want you guys back soon.
[SPEAKER_19]: Enjoy the song, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are growing from our hearts.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are growing from our hearts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rusted Jeff, his dreads are as long as I'm
tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he takes lots of dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rusted Jeff, he is growing turps for the

my feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this that I feel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you control off me?
[SPEAKER_07]: My body's in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's you that I need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it how you walk?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it how you talk?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it how you smile that made me come
alive?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know what it is about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because every little thing that I've been
searching for, girl, I see it in you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're my dream come true.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single day, in every little way,
every single night, I pray that you'll be
[SPEAKER_07]: there for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll be there for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it how you walk?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it how you talk?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it how you smile that made me come
alive?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know what it is about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we go for a walk and have a little
talk?

[SPEAKER_05]: The whole town's talking about her.
[SPEAKER_05]: This sweet little girl from Kitaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got a property that I truly admire.
[SPEAKER_05]: She smiles when I call her me,
Scott.
[SPEAKER_05]: She hears it everywhere that she goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where in the world did she get it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ask me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll find the right words to say to get
her into my world.
[SPEAKER_05]: God knows I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're saying I'm crazy,
telling your friends I'm a clown.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I won't let down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you know my intentions.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the table I lay down my cards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making all the preparations to send my
arrow to your heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll find the right words to say to get
you into my world.
[SPEAKER_05]: God knows I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I invited her out to the movies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wasn't like she would lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: But she said, let's find a disco where we
can jam all night.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found a place so nice and cozy.
[SPEAKER_05]: A few miles on the outskirts of town.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got so close together, I know she'll
stick around.
[SPEAKER_05]: This little girl, pretty little girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: This little girl, pretty little girl.
This little girl, pretty little girl.
I want to know.
I want to know.
I want to know.
I want to know.
I want to know.
