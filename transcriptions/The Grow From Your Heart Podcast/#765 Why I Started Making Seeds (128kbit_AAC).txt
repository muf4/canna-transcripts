[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys want to hear
about it or not, but it is time for an
[SPEAKER_00]: update on my health.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along with the
show, you know that I did experience the
[SPEAKER_00]: plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got this junk in my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy still kind of fluctuates,
but I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm much better in spirits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel way like I'm almost back,
but I can't just get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear it in my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more exaggerated when I get the
microphone and headphones going,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think I'm mostly back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who has been
sending me messages, well wishes,
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas for things that will help me get
over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate most of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys are crazy, but most of
you are sending great ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the love,
encouragement, support, the kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people said, hey bro,
we understand you're sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am doing just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice that the podcast went from
two episodes a week to one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs get really tired just talking
through a whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds ridiculous to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a mostly healthy dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm active.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot and now for my lungs to get
tired doing a podcast feels ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to take my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to pace myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't bang out two shows like I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for hearing the junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do hear the junk in my throat,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back on the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's quit talking about my health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares about the plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the folks that send me
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you guys out there don't want to
hear me talk about my health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we have a fun podcast lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sent a very good question just from
a friend, actually from my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipop Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Lolly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to John at Lollipop Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't need to mention their location or
anything else about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that I got nothing but love and
respect for everybody up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a text message that said it
may be a good idea if you talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: and why you got into breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize I've probably done that on this
podcast, but there are 765 episodes up and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you didn't see the episode where I
talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably been 300 episodes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to try to put out a lot of
grow information right now because since
[SPEAKER_00]: the plague hit me, my attention span is
not where it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to try to give you grow
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of detailed information with weeks
and numbers and times and things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could definitely flub and mess up
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to just kind of ramble for
another episode or two and just talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I can flow about and I can
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just talk about how I got
into breeding on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a personal story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't make mistakes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do make errors or mistakes,
somebody do correct me and remind me of
[SPEAKER_00]: how the story really went.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this won't mess up your garden in any
way and it will be a fun episode for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody to be involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's jump into a
little bit about how and why I got into
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and breeding and how we got where
we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many years ago, I was around growing
before I should have been, before I should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably statue of limitations are over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember being a little kid and one
of my uncles was growing cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another uncle said, hey bro,
tonight when the sun goes down,
[SPEAKER_00]: do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave specific instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 35 years ago, I don't remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we gave Uncle A gave Uncle B
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names will be changed to protect the
innocent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rest in peace to the uncles that are
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dammit, I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle gave Uncle instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle went outside to do the thing and he
was about to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me being just the little kid that I
was, I was this person when I was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: kid, but I was like, hey, Uncle,
that's not what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said to do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mom was standing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncle was standing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our other family friend who I was named
after was standing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like, oh shit,
he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the time before like text
messages and Google and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the eighties, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to just trust and rely on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I said that was wrong and I said the
correct way, like he is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time I remember being
around somebody growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize at the time what was
happening, but they were growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in the backyard at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward to, I moved to another
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give too many details
because I moved to a place where
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I accidentally spotted a friend's
cultivation in their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give too many details,
but I was somewhere and from above light
[SPEAKER_00]: hit me in the eye that shouldn't have been
coming from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just kind of, I was playing the
drums to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was obviously in a place where we
played the drums and light hit me where it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized, I was like,
oh, that's a fucking grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we were fucking, after we got
done, I can't give too many details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to bust anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we got done playing music,
I guess is what I could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told my friend, I was like, Hey bro,
I can kind of tell that you got lights
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to seal that up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, bro, do you know what you're
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, I kind of know about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, come here, I got to show you
some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed me his grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, this is what I think
is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I helped him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a look at the girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of helped him figure out what was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he needed a helper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just was in over his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needed a buddy that could do it since
I'd already discovered it and I was cool
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just decided that we were also friends
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'd, he decided that I was going to be
his, his bucket helper, his bucket monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically I carried buckets up the ladder
to upstairs and did weird shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had to go out of town
surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he went out of town, I just took
over and ran that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back for harvest and then paid me
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was one of my first experiences
of running a grow by myself is when he
[SPEAKER_00]: went out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out bro, if you hear this,
hope things are well, hope you're killing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that dude went out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of took over that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually I had to leave that
prohibition state and I had to come back
[SPEAKER_00]: to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came back to Colorado, everybody
was talking about medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I did was get my
medical marijuana recommendation from a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor and get all set up to be able to
shop at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this medical marijuana card also
gave me the ability to grow my own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd already been growing with my friends
in another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd grown a little bit when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had some experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I could definitely do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a huge market here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needed medical marijuana,
but there weren't enough people growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could grow a good product
reliably, people would be knocking down
[SPEAKER_00]: your door in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds bad, but it was a good way
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided I'm going to grow some
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it takes a little while to
grow some medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get some clones from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the story kind of
branches off and a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered seeds from a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the seed banks out there that
keep people supplied with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to grow, ordered seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had somewhat okay, somewhat not okay
experiences with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at the same time, since it's taking a
while to grow, I'm shopping at
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and I'm looking for quality
products and I'm just shopping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm shopping around, I realized
there's not a quality dispensary in my
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this branches out how buying seeds and
being dissatisfied leads me to making my
[SPEAKER_00]: own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time, shopping
dispensaries, looking for quality products
[SPEAKER_00]: leads me to finding a group of friends
where I was part of opening the first
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's two different branches of this
story that kind of put us where we are on
[SPEAKER_00]: the map of being a breeder and a
commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go the way of, I've got some
notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I found this group of friends that
wanted to start a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a good strategy, but they just
didn't have the oomph.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know they were older than me
is the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: No disrespect to the elders.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in 2008, so it's been several
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am their age now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've grown into that, but they were
older and didn't have the energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hipness, the enthusiasm that they
needed, but they had most of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the product and the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed a guy like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going to dispensaries all over
the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen things that I liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen things that I did not like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen what I thought worked and did
not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a retail background,
so I understood this going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understood what I was looking at,
what I was seeing, how I interacted with
[SPEAKER_00]: people, what I liked in the interactions
and didn't like, how the stores were set
[SPEAKER_00]: up, the products I enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I discovered this group of people
in my neighborhood that wanted to start a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, and they were a little slow
about it, I was like, I'm the guy you
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put my young energy, my young
creativity into that, and we started a
[SPEAKER_00]: very flourishing dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great facility here in Colorado,
here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we were shut down for
illegal zoning, but they built that rule
[SPEAKER_00]: around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They zoned us out because they did not
want us there in that part of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may talk about that at another part of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was growing for this dispensary,
and I was growing for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did acquire some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some clones from some neighborhood
friends, and I grew those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what inspired me to get seeds was the
dispensary, and everybody in my
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood had the same clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dispensary was selling clones to
people, so the dispensary had all the same
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: All had the same weed because we were just
selling clones like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the growers in the neighborhood
came to my dispensary and got clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same shit that I was growing at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just all the same shit,
and I was trying to sell on the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my own side hustle going,
and we wanted to stay fresh at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to separate ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do that was to get a bunch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used my own money and did my own
phenohunts at home and my own personal
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would take the winners from that to
the commercial grow that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the store, which route do we talk about
that right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just buy seeds and grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing at home, and the seeds
would come, and I would grow them at home,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would phenohunt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get a pack of seeds and find the best
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would take that to the commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That commercial grow is where I learned
how to grow on a big level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't necessarily a commercial
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't set up right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was before commercial grows were really
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of right before that,
but it was as big as I had been in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we made a lot of flower come out of
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to run a lot of lights,
a lot of plants by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That started me in a big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the one at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly maybe possibly had a couple
others in other places we shouldn't talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, but that's what got me going on
commercial growing and in a dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then ordering those seeds is another part
of this big story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those seeds I bought were awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio of fucking awesome to fucking
terrible seeds was not worth buying more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, so I did what any good grower would
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some of the best seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually made friends with some growers,
some other breeders online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start posting pictures of my grow,
of my stuff that I was growing from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: and from clone, and people took notice,
and other people started sending me seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some seeds from some other really
reputable popular breeders, and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: cross them and make other things,
and then I realized I can make better
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds than what I am buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do a little bit of work,
and I can make enough seeds for myself to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and have better seeds than what I'm
spending hundreds of dollars for coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then you had to buy all the seed
banks were in Canada or in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd have to hope your shit got over
the border through customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd go through your package.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'd get a package that
had been cut open, and there's a letter
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of it that said, nice try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'd get your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'd pay for the money back
guarantee, and you'd get your money back,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you wouldn't get the shipping fees,
and you wouldn't get half your shit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just how it went back in the
day, so I made my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to keep spending money on
seeds when I knew I could do it myself
[SPEAKER_00]: just as good as the guys on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why couldn't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the experience, the space,
the encouragement, the fucking the drive
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it, so I made my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a few crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a feminized cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a batch of feminized seeds that I
grew, and when I started posting pictures,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are like, dude, that's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks really good, and when my
friends would smoke it and grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I bred some grateful dog, and I took it
to a party here, and it was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: batch that I thought was dried and cured
properly enough to take some more and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it, and I cracked open the jar,
and everybody at the outside of the party
[SPEAKER_00]: on the back porch where I was,
everybody for about a 10 or 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 15 foot radius just came right to me
like a bunch of cockroaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what kind of weed is that,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cracked it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rolled a fat bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rolled a fat joint, packed a couple of
bowls, and we all smoked, and I knew that
[SPEAKER_00]: that weed was super special, and I'd made
seeds of that, so I had some seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I packaged up a bunch of those,
and there was a cannabis cup coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it may have been the first one at
that place with the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was Denver Mart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been the Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what year it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a brain injury and this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know to document this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know it was going to be some sort
of historical event for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just doing what I was doing,
so I made a bunch of seeds, and I took
[SPEAKER_00]: them to the cannabis cup, and on those
seed packages, I just put, I was calling
[SPEAKER_00]: myself I read genetics already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just decided that was a cool name,
so I put I read genetics, and then I put
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of the strain on the cross,
and I put my email address on there
[SPEAKER_00]: because I didn't have a website yet,
and at the cannabis cup, anybody that had,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're walking around with like a
bottle of nutrients or a grow light or
[SPEAKER_00]: like a pot or maybe some soil,
anything that indicated to me that you
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to go home and attempt to grow
cannabis, I gave you seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a great, just a freebie
for me to give to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ask for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good way to get seeds in people's
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: My idea was just I made a lot of these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to grow maybe a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can have the other 2400 that I
made, and I put them out there for the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, so I gave a bunch of those away
with my info on the packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of those people sat on those
seeds for a minute, but then eventually,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes four, five, maybe six months to
get the grow finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, six, eight months later,
people started messaging me, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like hey bro, I grew these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's pictures, and the pictures would
look stellar, and those people would say
[SPEAKER_00]: can I get more seeds from you,
and I would politely say yes you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this time, they may cost a little bit
of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started posting around social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started going to more cannabis cups and
more events, and started breeding more,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning more about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started giving me plants they
thought would breed well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders started sending me seeds and
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a name for myself in that industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I went to more cannabis cups,
people would hunt me down and try to give
[SPEAKER_00]: me money for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got politely asked to stop
selling or leave a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a backpack filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would run up, and I just take their
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them seeds, and then some of the high
time staff thought that that was bad that
[SPEAKER_00]: I was selling without a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree, should get my own booth and sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the booths at the events,
sell seeds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I built a website,
and it wasn't the best website,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was my way of starting to build a
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built a website and a social media
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing a lot of online and live
stuff, and that's a lot of why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why people trust me is
because I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing a bright yellow shirt with a
purple background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 6'5 with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my knees, to my ankles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost touching the floor right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in like a bar stool high chair,
and they're touching my shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel it, but I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think a lot of people support
the brand and support me because I support
[SPEAKER_00]: you back, and I don't hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders, you don't even know who
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what they're about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think building an audience with the
social media folks, doing a podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: that really helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just showing you that I'm a normal person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionate for cannabis, and kind of
opening up the window, the curtain,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, so that you could see what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share a lot with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that really helps with my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of what got me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my own booth set up, started selling
at shows, and then still sell at the
[SPEAKER_00]: events when they do happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Endo Expo got canceled, and then the
next event that was lined up was the Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I had to skip that because
I had the vid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send Mike in place to do work for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling like crazy, but I'm telling
a story, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is story time with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I make a lot of feminized and
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fem seeds seem to be quite reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: My regular seeds seem to be quite potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't follow a lot of the trends and the
hype of what I see in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't usually see me work with... I
hate to be naming things, but like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles and the Cake and the Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never saw me do stuff with a lot of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay away from the trends,
and I just do... My motto has always been
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart and breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see two plants, I just know that
this plant needs to donate pollen to this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to make little babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm a matchmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm a plant porn director.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, it just feels natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I think I was... Part of what I
was born to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I was put here to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I became Rasta Jeff,
the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was basically tired of buying seeds that
were not quality, that did not reach my
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations, and for paying ridiculous
prices for things that had to get shipped
[SPEAKER_00]: from another country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being made in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The companies would be... They'd have
California and the name, and they'd say
[SPEAKER_00]: like New York and the name, and those
people would ship their seeds overseas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I would pay money to have them
fucking shipped back to me, and then half
[SPEAKER_00]: of them wouldn't be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing any either of those
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying they would... We know
they're coming from America, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping it to another country,
then shipping it right back, and I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a...
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets taken in customs, and that was
just a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of what led me to making
my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed seller, but still, if you find
something stellar, make some crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do encourage you, promote you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowed to breed with the seeds
that you get from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't fart one day and have fresh
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't sneeze and make a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with other people's genetics
just like all other breeders do,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you've got my permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do breed with my genetics,
all I ask is that you put the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross that you used on the package and
give me a little bit of credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe send me a 10 or 20 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my friends might grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see pictures of your seeds on my
Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got like strawberry starburst
crossed to your whatever you got mail or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you got, I may be interested in
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got my permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked about how I got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I was buying seeds,
not happy with them, got into the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial growing started at a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a multi-level building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom was a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next two levels were straight up a
production grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do smaller stuff in one area,
carry it up to another area, flower it up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an amazing cultivation facility
made out of a retail store is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: what that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually that place did get closed
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the city attorney and some
law enforcement came, handed us some
[SPEAKER_00]: documents and said we had to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, when those people,
when the law enforcement came,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they did not have their firearms out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not doing a raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were simply escorting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law enforcement was escorting the city
attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: City attorney handed paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper was signed and they said,
you guys are now not allowed to sell any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis related products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question was, well, can we sell
non?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what about, no, they said they have,
you have to lock the door and stop selling
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis related products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what about the people in line?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we don't know about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they left after we signed the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those last few people that didn't get up
and run, when the cops came in,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the city attorney came in,
guess how much cannabis they got for the
[SPEAKER_00]: money that they brought that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came to buy a 20 bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably left with an ounce each for
a very cheap because they stuck around
[SPEAKER_00]: when the cops walked in and they didn't
get up and bail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that was respectable,
respectful and commendable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got hooked up, but they did close
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They closed us, like I said earlier,
for zoning violations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point we had to figure out
stuff on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of when I started doing
commercial growing at other places,
[SPEAKER_00]: drifting around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at another commercial grow that
never really got off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We helped them build it, but they always
had technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got called to go work at Green and
Healthy, kind of helped get that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there, I think I ended up over
at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I built a commercial, what's it
called?
[SPEAKER_00]: A commercial consulting reputation and
just started doing consulting at several
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those few places I mentioned were public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there, I'm allowed to talk about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them, we signed non-disclosure
agreements to where they, I can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you that I worked there, but I worked
at a lot of cool places in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I got to the commercial
cultivation, learning how to do things on
[SPEAKER_00]: a totally different scale, different
level, fighting pests in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I rambled about the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was how and why did I get
into breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went quite a ways into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the bottom line was I was not
satisfied with what I was buying and I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that I could create a quality product
for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day the people at the dispensary,
I brought them some of the flowers I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like, bro, you grow a better
herb than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I wanted to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all my voice and throat
have got time for, for this episode.
