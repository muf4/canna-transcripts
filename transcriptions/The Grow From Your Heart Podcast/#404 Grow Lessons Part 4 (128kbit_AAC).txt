[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Show Podcast World!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 404 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am still dabbing this Pineapple Fanta
Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the label says it is a
combination of Golden Pineapple and Jet
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuel Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor on the label is described as
citrus cleaner, haze, and fruit chews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it tastes just like a pineapple
Fanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the flavor and aroma even include
the fizzy part of the Fanta drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's delicious and amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the product container,
it says it contains 59.81% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the Pineapple Fanta Live
Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode is
going to be another compilation of
[SPEAKER_00]: reposted grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we are going to revisit
episodes 378, 380, 383, 385, 387,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 388.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's travel back in time and revisit
[SPEAKER_00]: these grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Show Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 378 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a tradition that I start the
podcast off by letting you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, today, I feel like total shit
and I haven't been dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving my body a little bit of a rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a head cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a chest cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this sinus thing going on that is
driving me completely crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to take any dabs before
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to keep my shit together
and deliver you guys a decent podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I promised another
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grow series started at episode 351.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't caught up, I suggest you
head back to episode 351.
[SPEAKER_00]: In episode 351, we set a goal for our
garden and then we move on to selecting a
[SPEAKER_00]: space for our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also select the proper equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we build the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talk about seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we veg our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talk about a few tricks and tips
to get our plants up to speed for quality
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point in my grow lessons,
it is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to flip our crop from the
vegetative phase into the flowering phase
[SPEAKER_00]: of our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to listen back to this intro and
see how I sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I come back, we are going to talk
about flowering our new cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I apologize that
I do sound kind of crappy, but the show
[SPEAKER_00]: must go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been promising this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may make this one kind of quick and then
recap next week and move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: My original idea was to do a three week
chunk of flowering episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would do week one through three and
then four through six and seven through
[SPEAKER_00]: nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to focus on day one of
week one today and then we will adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: from there in the following episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started on flowering our
cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to initiate the budding phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering phase for regular cannabis
plants is triggered by reducing the light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working with auto flower
plants, you were in a total different
[SPEAKER_00]: ballgame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will flower when they are
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this discussion, we're going to focus
on regular photo period plants and photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about flowering our photo
period garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiating flower is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we do is reduce the timer to 12 hours
on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness
every day to trigger these plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it several times, but I'm going
to repeat myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need total uninterrupted darkness
during the night phase for our flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of light is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see a pinprick of light coming
in that room, it is too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face during the dark phase in that room,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants know that that light is
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not go to sleep properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not flower properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do try to flower properly,
you give them the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditing on you in mid flower,
which will produce seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will ruin your whole goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need 100% total darkness in our
flowering room during the night phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So switch the timer to 12 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure that you have got total dark in
that dark phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go in there and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably need to hang out in the grow
room for about 15 to 20 minutes for your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes to adjust properly to identify the
most minimal light leaks you could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there and check for light leaks
on day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any light coming in,
you need to correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will ruin your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've set the timer to 12 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is on for 12 hours a day and it is
off for 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a lot of thought into the hours which
your lights run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want those lights to come on in the
morning when you wake up so you can water
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants before you go to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plants are on all day while
you're gone at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you get to come home and check
them out before the lights turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want those lights to come on in
the evening right when you get home from
[SPEAKER_00]: work and the lights can run all night
while you're home and you can check on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can get up before work and
they're still on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check on them again before you go
to work and make sure everything's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a lot of thought into
scheduling my flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to consider while you're
planning your schedule is electricity is
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper during off-peak hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that during the evenings when
everybody goes home and they're chilling,
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity gets cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the daytime business hours when
everybody's using all the electricity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the electric company does charge you more
for those peak hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: What many folks will choose to do is run
those lights during off-peak hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: save money on electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also advantageous because it is
cooler during the evenings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the sun up keeping your
grow room extra hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not heating the outside with the
sun and the inside with the grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun goes down and gets a little cooler
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that cool outside air to your
advantage and keep the grow room cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about your scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you want that 12-12 on-cycle to
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you want that 12-12 off-cycle to
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do decide to run your lights at
night and have your dark cycle during the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural light cycle, be sure that no
sunshine is creeping into your grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: during that night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we need total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very common mistake is that people
flower their plants at night, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: they are in the sleep cycle during the
day, which means there's the opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: for the sunshine to sneak into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a window, if you've got a
doorway, if you've got some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: insecure structure, you can get light in
there very easily and it will destroy your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've thought about scheduling and you
know how it's going to work around your
[SPEAKER_00]: work schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it's going to work around
your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know when you're going to flower
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you'll have time to give
them maintenance and work on them and
[SPEAKER_00]: water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan your scheduling around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have set the timer to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first short day is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that day down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people forget to write that down
and they don't know how long their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have been in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down your flowering start date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to make clear is this
is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a package of seeds and it
says takes 70 to 80 days to flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the first day of that 70 to 80
days of that finishing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks like to start the flowering
phase when they see buds set starting,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they see preflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were 12 days into flower by then and
you were ripping yourself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering starts the day we change the
timer to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've now switched the timer to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will be on for 12 hours a day
and off for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the environmental
conditions we need to provide for our
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering plants here at the beginning of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will change as the plants progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we don't have any buds to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are much less opportunities for
mildew and molds to take hold because when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get those chunky buds, the mildew
likes to start in the middle of those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really a worry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have the humidity a little
higher at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have the temps a little higher at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we progress, we are going to lower
the humidity and the temperature in our
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering room to accommodate those big
chunky buds and to prevent problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this phase of the game, it would be
ideal to have your grow room between 70
[SPEAKER_00]: and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend higher than 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend lower than 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you're struggling to
keep your room cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of new growers have issues keeping
the grow room cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: 84 is the max you ever want to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit 85 degrees and higher,
your plants will stop producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will just go into a stagnant,
dead, slowed down mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: How productive do you want to be when it's
110 degrees outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can't move themselves to some
shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can't grab some water and take
a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are stuck there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them the proper environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this phase of the flowering cycle,
I would recommend 70 to 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit during your lights on cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
humidity of this grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the start of the flowering phase,
I like to have about 40 to 50 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I said we don't have those big
buds to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've just got a bunch of lush,
happy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just in there sucking up all that
humidity and growing like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 40 to 50 percent relative humidity and
70 to 80 degrees during your daytime
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to dial that in,
I recommend you check out my episode about
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was episode number 314.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in learning more
about the vapor pressure deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I find to be very important when it
comes to dialing in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD will really improve the productivity
of your plants if you understand it and
[SPEAKER_00]: dial it in correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the daytime condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want 70 to 80 degrees during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 to 50 percent relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the nighttime
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we turn off the light, things are
going to change in that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep the humidity right around
the same levels at nighttime at this stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that 40 to 50 percent humidity
during the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now during the night cycle, I like it to
get a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It naturally cools off at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like the plants probably enjoy a
little bit cooler of a temperature at
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to go any more than 10 degrees
difference on a day and night temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called your diurnal temperature
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want that to sway more than
10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if during your day cycle here at 75,
you do not want your night cycle to get
[SPEAKER_00]: any lower than 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would generally try to keep it about
five degrees difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand we're building new grow
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are learning our setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are learning to dial these rooms in
five to 10 degrees is acceptable for a
[SPEAKER_00]: diurnal temperature variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go any more than five to 10
degrees differential in your day and night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, you will cause problems
within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will be confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will begin to grow slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also a great way to invite
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to keep your temperature swings
within 10 degrees from your day and
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're walking through the grow,
sometimes just reach out and grab a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and feel the temperature of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the plant warm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the plant cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the plant feel to your hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants feel really, really cold,
they're probably really cold and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably increase the temperature of your
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants feel like they're warm,
they're probably warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably lower the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature of your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I do plan to do a
discussion on leaf surface temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: versus ambient room temperature,
but we are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I may have overlooked when
I talked about equipment is a hygrometer
[SPEAKER_00]: and a thermometer or some sort of a
monitoring device to know what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in our grow room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us growers can probably afford the
hygrometer thermometer combo that sits in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow room and it marks the humidity
and temperature of the room, but it will
[SPEAKER_00]: also mark the highest and lowest points of
your humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find your peaks and your
valleys and identify the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity fluctuations in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to know where the peaks
and valleys are, but I like to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have something in the room that
can tell me what's going on at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a reliable monitor that can keep you
up to date on what's happening in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room at all times, I would suggest
something like a P.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: grow systems minder unit or perhaps a
Smart B unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use both of those units to monitor
your grow room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull up the data on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what's happening in the room
in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these types of units allow you to
actually plug in other devices and trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: them from your smart phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were away, you open up your
application, you see that it's too warm in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, hey, let's just easily turn
on the air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click a button on a tab on your
phone and it will fire up the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner in your grow room and you can
rescue your garden while you're at lunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out with your friends and you
don't even have to leave the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is have some way to monitor
the temperature and humidity in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have a report of what happens
when those lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been running that grow light for 12
hours in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've created a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have created a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that heat, all of that light energy
has created humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is water rising up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we kill that light, everything
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that humidity in the air is no
longer being heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the opportunity to start falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes kind of thick in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That short time period while the room
stabilizes itself out from that change is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite often the cause of many of our
powdery mildew and boy tritus issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many growers don't even know that that
is happening in the room at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at their hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at their thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, oh, it was 72 degrees in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was 45 percent humidity in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't realize that there was a point
where it was 78 degrees and about 82
[SPEAKER_00]: percent humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because we turned off that
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that moisture that was in the air is
now falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plants don't have light anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are starting to respirate a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're letting out a little more
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that chaos can really cause
problems for our plants in that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is try to know what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmentally in your rooms at all
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we know what our environment
should be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about feeding our
transitioning cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are working in a no till bed or
you're working with super soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no need to adjust anything at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically need to water the plants
throughout the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on adding a cover crop or a
top dress or maybe feeding some teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will need to adjust your teas at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take the nitrogen products out and
focus more on the phosphorus and potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: at this time if you're running teas or top
dress or a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are working with bottled
nutrients, you can probably just swap out
[SPEAKER_00]: that veg bottle and replace it with the
flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the bottled nutrient companies
make it very easy to follow their nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply swap out that veg bottle,
put in the bloom bottle and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: should be good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference in our feeding
schedule at this time is that we are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce the amount of nitrogen and we
are going to slowly start increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants take up approximately 80 to 90
percent of their nitrogen during the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we switch them into flower,
they are done sucking up nitrogen and they
[SPEAKER_00]: want more phosphorus and potassium so they
can build robust branches and big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's reduce the nitrogen and start
increasing the phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part should mostly be covered by your
base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a one bottle base
nutrient, a two part or a three part,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be getting the proper nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium from your base
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are a few more things that these
plants can use at this phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to add silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I am mixing up my nutrient solution,
I always put potassium silicates in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potassium silicates go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I mix in my base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants can probably use cow mag at
this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to give the plants some sort
of a root inoculant early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut back the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those roots growing strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will continue to flourish in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like some enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those enzymes serve several purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes will basically help to keep
the root zone clean and they will also
[SPEAKER_00]: break down any decaying root matter and
turn that into usable energy for my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to add some carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbohydrates serve a couple of
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those carbs will feed my microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those carbs will also give my plants
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the carbs, the enzymes and the
mycos, my root zone is really healthy and
[SPEAKER_00]: really active, which will show up top at
the top of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are focusing on nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are shifting away from the nitrogen
more toward the phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to add cow mag,
a little bit of a root inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like some enzymes, always some carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make everything pop, I would add a
little bit of fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you've chosen to work with a
specific bottle nutrient company,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those companies have a nutrient
calculator on their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to whatever nutrient company
dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find their nutrient calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can type in how many weeks you're
going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on which products of theirs
you have purchased and it will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: week by week how much of each product to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those charts are reliable,
but keep in mind they want you to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: buying products so they may recommend you
use a little more than necessary for an
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal crop situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally reduce the recommended dosage
by about 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says to feed 100 milliliters of your
base product, I would start off with 75
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always feed the plants a little
more later, but we can never take out the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding once we've put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't burn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for them to show you that they are
happy or that they are angry and adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these nutrient companies offer a
fairly balanced diet within their own
[SPEAKER_00]: product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have to reach out to another
brand or another company and fill in
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that they are missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to mix nutrient lines,
be very careful that you don't double up
[SPEAKER_00]: on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When nutrient company A made their product
lines, they made five bottles and they put
[SPEAKER_00]: the base newts in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put the CalMag in the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put the humic acid in another and a
bloom booster in another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what is in each bottle and they
can recommend your feeding because they
[SPEAKER_00]: know they're not going to overdose
anything with their design.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you introduce a product from another
company, you run the risk of doubling up
[SPEAKER_00]: on specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrient company A and nutrient company B
did not talk to each other about their
[SPEAKER_00]: designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be running a base product from
nutrient company A, then you may have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom booster from nutrient company B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those companies didn't talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Company A was putting CalMag inside their
base nutrient to help you out and save you
[SPEAKER_00]: with the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Company B was putting the CalMag inside
the bloom booster to help you out and save
[SPEAKER_00]: a bottle and you didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you just fed two doses of CalMag
because you combined nutrient companies
[SPEAKER_00]: and didn't read the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you choose to use products from two
different companies, be sure not to
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap with any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what's in each product and you
understand how the plants use each of
[SPEAKER_00]: those products and you're not going to
cause any problems, there is nothing wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with combining nutrient companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like the brand you were using
is lacking something, feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase another product from another
company and add that into your mix as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as you don't double up any specific
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good example of what I'm talking about
is in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run Veg Bloom powdered
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, Veg Bloom could use a
little bit of fulvic acid added to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, Veg Bloom can use a little
bit of carbohydrates added to the mix
[SPEAKER_00]: later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am comfortable adding those products
and I've done my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how much carbs, I know how much
fulvic acid is in my starting product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that I'm not going to overdose
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm confident that we
understand the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident that we understand what to
feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some more techniques to
do at the very start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using sprayed pesticide
applications, now is a great time to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: a pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are running out of time for sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to start developing bud sites
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to treat these plants today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's apply a preventative product to our
plants to ensure we do not get any pests
[SPEAKER_00]: in our veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not going to use spray
pesticide applications, now is a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: to release your beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get them colonized and built up
in the grow before other insects have an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to take hold in our flowering
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants are flowering,
we don't have a lot of options for pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do everything we can now to
prevent a pest infestation while we have
[SPEAKER_00]: big chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would treat for pests at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray pesticides if that is your approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I like to do on day one of
flower is trellis my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I am not able
to move my veg plants into a room and
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a veg room and I have flowering
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering rooms are constantly
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't veg in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I move the plants into the flowering
area and I put the trellis up on day one
[SPEAKER_00]: and I bend and pop and work those plants
into the net on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives them plenty of time to recover
from the stress of getting beat up while
[SPEAKER_00]: they transition to the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about seven to ten days where
they're just transitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be any bud growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be any major activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we beat them up on day one,
we've got plenty of time to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to get in there and get them
under the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do popping and twisting,
which is also known as supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this in depth in other
episodes, but I'll give you a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start at the very bottom stock of the
plant where it comes out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab the base of the stock with my left
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my right hand above that and I grab
the stock and I twist my right hand
[SPEAKER_00]: counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear a pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds kind of like a knuckle popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pop my knuckle into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it picked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear a little pop sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the sound you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to break the cellulose
structure of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll break it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll move my left hand from the
bottom right up above my right hand and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it another break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll move up and give it another
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work my way up the main stem all the way
until it gets real thin and I feel like I
[SPEAKER_00]: could cause problems by snapping it up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've done the main stock,
I go back down to the bottom of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and I find the lowest branch and I work
that branch all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I work every single branch on every
single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes hours in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hands will be sore, but the plants
will thank you for it in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now they look like they got twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a little bit beat up,
but in a few days all of those twists will
[SPEAKER_00]: create what looks like a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make the plant more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make it stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give it more strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those thicker stocks can move
more nutrients which makes a more
[SPEAKER_00]: productive plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a bigger stock can hold up a
bigger bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working those plants to be more
robust by cracking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They heal themselves and they become
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to do popping and twisting at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to do a nice defoliation on
day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take out all that excess leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm there, I like to clean up the
bottoms quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off some of the crappy bottom
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off some of those sucker branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off all the bottom leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a lot of that crap on the
bottom of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to wait a little bit
later, closer to week two, to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottoming and the lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do it early in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will get ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't start it right away,
it gets really easy to fall behind very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a commercial environment that only
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on day one, I move the plants into the
flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give the plants a nice pop and twist and
work them into the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do some defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do a bunch of bottoming and
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right before we leave for the
night, we give the plants a nice pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important thing to think about at
this transitional time is bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of bulbs are you going to use
for flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually recommend a metal halide for
vegging and a high pressure sodium for
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting technology has advanced so far in
recent years that you may be using LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be using ceramic metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of options, but consider
changing your spectrum early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: One useful trick I have learned to help
reduce the early flower stretch is to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the metal halide bulbs in for the
first two weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will swap out the metal
halides for the high pressure sodiums on
[SPEAKER_00]: day one of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned that if you leave those
halides in there, for two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants will not stretch as
ridiculously when you initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is natural for plants to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cracking them, popping them,
twisting them, and keeping in that metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halide will drastically slow down that
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we have a good solid
foundation on transitioning our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: from veg to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, if you are growing from
seeds, you will need to keep a close eye
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plants and look out for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to look out for
hermaphrodites and you will need to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention for mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant in there doing some
weird shit, you need to decide if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it or let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those mutant plants put off
amazing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also a pain in the ass to grow
and they are problematic, so sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not even worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a mutant, it is up to you
to decide what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to stay on top of is
scouting for insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did just apply some pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have released some predator bugs,
but that does not mean that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be scouting for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, as you walk through the grow,
just to go from one end to the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: to go get the scissors you forgot down
there or to go find the broom,
[SPEAKER_00]: just glance at the plants as you walk by.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when I make the most random
discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even looking for something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just walking by and I said,
what the hell is that out of the corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: my eye?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be scouting for bugs and problems
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eyes open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for mutants and we need to
pay close attention for signs of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel the cold medicine that I took
starting to kick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face is going numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose is starting to run kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to wrap up this podcast before I
get too lit to be on a microphone.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 380 of The Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.

I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find them at www.dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog
Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says 64.7% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a total of 76.4 total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of my favorite strains to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite strains to take
photos of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always one of my favorite strains to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always love that nice head buzz from
the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm taking dabs of Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that will make for a great
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be another grow
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started by setting a goal for our
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a right place for our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We selected and purchased the appropriate
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the grow, we are past
week one of flower and we are entering
[SPEAKER_00]: week two of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will highlight weeks two and
three or days eight through 21 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you need a better
foundation and you haven't been listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to the show, I recommend you head back to
episode 351 and start on the grow lessons
[SPEAKER_00]: in episode 351.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along and you
feel like you're up to speed, let's jump
[SPEAKER_00]: right into a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to focus on
weeks two and three of the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, also known as days eight through
21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's recap a little
bit of the previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, we changed our timer
to 12 hours on and 12 hours off to
[SPEAKER_00]: initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now seven days into the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully at this point, you have not over
fertilized or ran into any pH issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully at this point, you have not
interrupted the dark cycle at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interrupting that dark cycle will disrupt
the flowering phase and throw your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: into shock and possibly cause
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the garden has remained pest and
pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if everything is on the right track,
let's move in to week two or day eight of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of the flowering process,
we're not going to notice much change from
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice a little bit of stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants may have taken off and they're
starting to get a little bit taller on
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your plants may be showing
preflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your plants may start indicating
sex around this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress if they are not showing you
sex yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing you're going to see at
this point is stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are starting to grow taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what we're expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first three weeks, we're going to
see a lot of stretching happening to these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we will probably start seeing
preflower and bud sets starting to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: around day 10 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will definitely have little dandelion
looking bud sets popping up around day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are about to start getting very
exciting in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the environment and
conditions in our grow room during weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: two and three of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of flowering, during the
day, I try to aim between 70 and 80
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit for my daytime
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also aim for 40 to 50 percent relative
humidity for my daytime temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about nighttime
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the nighttime, I like to have my
temperature between 60 and 70 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also aim for 40 to 50 percent humidity
during my nighttime cycle at this stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to remind you, try not to have
more than a 10 degree temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in your day and nighttime
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called your diurnal temperature
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep that less than 10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much of a drastic swing from day to
night temperature will start causing your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to grow slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get stagnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this will encourage powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's aim to keep that temperature
within 10 degrees from the day and night
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we should add into our flower
room that I've been overlooking on
[SPEAKER_00]: previous episodes is more fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we are entering the flowering stage,
we are going to develop big fat chunky
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have those buds in the room,
we're going to have a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have big fat chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds will act like a sponge if there
is too much moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to blow some air around the
room and keep that moisture moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a little bit of wind and
airflow is really good for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them active.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some wind and a little bit of
pressure makes the stalks more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them want to stand up on their
own a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I shoved you a little bit,
you would spread your feet for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a little bit of wind makes the
plants want to spread their feet for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So add a little bit of wind and airflow to
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a wind tunnel in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to dry out the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want the air moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some of your leaves start looking dry
and leathery and kind of potato chip like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably getting beat up by that
fan too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are ruining the VPD around those
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that condition, just reduce the wind
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's never a bad idea to have some
airflow in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice your grow room is
consistently too humid, it may be time to
[SPEAKER_00]: invest in a dehumidifier or maybe a larger
dehumidifier or possibly add some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction fan to remove that humid air
from the room and replace it with fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do add an extraction fan,
keep in mind that as the air gets sucked
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the room, it is also going to try
to draw air into the room through every
[SPEAKER_00]: open opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you're going to get air
pulled into the room underneath the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us don't seal the bottom of the
door well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is a great place for
fresh air to come in as long as the air
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that air is coming from within your
house, it is probably safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that crack leads to outside,
I would cover that up and find a safer
[SPEAKER_00]: source for the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to bring in bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to bring in whatever is by that
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's powdery mildew, if it's just dirt
and dust, it's going to suck all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: right under the door into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you cut a hole for an
extraction fan, start thinking about where
[SPEAKER_00]: the air is going to come in when you start
blowing that air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut a hole in a wall and add an
extraction fan and blow that air out,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the room, it may create a whistling
noise underneath the door from all the air
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing underneath that door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it creates a big whistling noise,
you may need to add a passive hole for air
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just depends on the size of the
extraction fan that you set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a little four inch extraction
fan, you'll definitely pull enough air
[SPEAKER_00]: under the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to make any passive holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go setting up an eight inch vortex
fan in there and you're just blowing air
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I recommend a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that extraction fan that's going out,
you need to filter that air, but also you
[SPEAKER_00]: may need to make about a four inch hole to
allow air to get into that room somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are sucking all of the air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to allow fresh air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting holes in walls and adding
extraction fans can lead to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this very carefully before you
go this route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're using CO2, you may want to
think about this option because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to fill the room with CO2 and
then you're just going to use that exhaust
[SPEAKER_00]: fan to suck the CO2 right out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of blowing your expensive gas
right out the window, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of opened up the conversation
for negative pressure versus positive
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure in a grow room environment,
but I feel like that is a lesson for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will write a note and we will talk about
that in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a little bit more on track with
this grow lesson and focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the
nutrients we may need at this phase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this part of flowering,
we are mainly focusing on a smooth
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from the vegetation stage to
the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in flowering, we are mainly
focusing on a smooth transition from the
[SPEAKER_00]: veg stage to the flowering stage of our
plant cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two is very similar to week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will mainly focus on our NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a low nitrogen, high phosphorus,
high potassium diet at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, abandon the veg bottle and
start using the bloom bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we need CalMag at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I also like to add a
mycoproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of root product is always good
at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, enzymes and carbs are great for week
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we work toward week three, I like to
increase my carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are getting bud set at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having some sugars in there to feed
the microbes and then I like having the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbs and the sugars in there to give the
plants energy that will encourage rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of week three,
I will start increasing my carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding just a little bit and I will
slowly increase that through the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we don't need to add a bloom booster
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just focus on getting these plants
through the stretch phase and get the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sites developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we work on the next lesson,
we will start adding bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we are rapidly running out of time
for pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do a very thorough pest
scouting and see what we've got in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a myriad of problems
popping up at this point in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do an inspection and find out what
we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find any pests, now is one of your
last times to apply a sprayed pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to spray anything after day
14.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an obvious problem,
we may extend that just a few days with
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific products, but I really don't
like to spray anything past day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a quick scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's identify any problems we may have
and let's spray before day 14 approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we're at day eight,
so we can get two or three solid pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: spray applications in if they are
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't identify any pests,
I may still suggest a preventative spray
[SPEAKER_00]: around day 14 just to make sure nothing
pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to get in there and
identify pests and work really hard at
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of them before we move deeper
into the flowering phase and we really
[SPEAKER_00]: limit ourselves on pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a good time to start ordering
your predator bugs if you're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals as your pesticide treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on using biologicals,
think about your spray applications and
[SPEAKER_00]: use a strategy that will not cause harm to
your beneficials when they do arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pesticides that you can apply to
your plants today and you can release
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects tomorrow and they will
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you apply the proper pesticide,
you will not kill your beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to do some research on the
pesticide and the beneficials and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: they get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the pesticides are based on
pyrethrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are based on neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are beneficial fungus and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those beneficial fungus and bacteria may
not kill or disrupt your predator bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it will make the environment
uncomfortable for the spider mites because
[SPEAKER_00]: they intend to eat those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predators are going to eat the spider
mites, not the leaves, so they may be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to survive with certain pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your responsibility as the grower to
do the research on the pesticide you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to apply and also do research on the
predator bugs which you plan to use in
[SPEAKER_00]: your integrated pest management strategy
and find out if they can work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the newer pesticide and fungicide
products actually advertise safe for
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials or will not harm beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is saying that they recommend that
product in a garden that is also using
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects as a form of pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on top of pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some scouting and if you see
anything, now is the time to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of that before we get deeper
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while you're scouting for pests,
that is a great time to keep an eye out
[SPEAKER_00]: for male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from seed, you've got
the opportunity to find males in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have also got the opportunity to find
hermaphrodites in the garden and you may
[SPEAKER_00]: also find some mutants in your flowering
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plants are going to start popping
up around day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually open up and start dropping
pollen right around day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a very small window of time
to discover these males and get them out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the room before they cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be lazy when it comes to pulling
males out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small garden, if you've
got a large garden, you need to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: every single plant and pull every single
male out of that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to pay very close attention
for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're checking for males and
hermaphrodites on new plants, check in
[SPEAKER_00]: several spots on each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top may not reveal hermaphrodite
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down lower where you're not getting a lot
of light penetration, those plants may
[SPEAKER_00]: show intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get male flowers popping up in
your female buds lower on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention to the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I gave a pretty good
description of what a male plant looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like and what a female plant looks like on
a previous podcast, but I do encourage you
[SPEAKER_00]: to Google male and female cannabis plants
and see what they look like before the
[SPEAKER_00]: time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when you've got a boy in the
garden, you are sure and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence and you can remove that male
plant from your garden confidently and
[SPEAKER_00]: know you are not going to cause any
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to find the boys before the
pollen sacks start opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what happens if you find
a boy and one of those sacks is starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would do is spray it
with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will deactivate the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also make the plants unable to
receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you can either cut down
that male plant or you can slide a trash
[SPEAKER_00]: bag right over it like a condom,
then cut it, then get it out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try not to spread that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've sprayed it with water,
but as you bump it around, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: More pollen is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best not to spread that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the trash bag over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either take the whole plant, including the
dirt, out of the grow or cut it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: base and just get that plant out of there
as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving a male plant in the grow room for
too long will result in a seeded crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are aiming for a seedless crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing a crop for a commercial
reason and you're trying to put it out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market, a couple of seeds will
ruin the value of your entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eye out for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what males look like and get them out
of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, keep an eye out for hermaphrodites
and get them out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we are past weeks two and three,
you cannot get lazy if you're growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they look like females,
you've still got the opportunity for a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite to pop up all the way
through the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not show itself until week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not show itself until week 10,
but you need to see it if it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said earlier, if it pops up late in
flower, it may not be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is too late for the plants to receive
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't make any seeds that late into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, if they throw a male
flower past week seven or eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're usually sterile male flowers that
will not contain any pollen, so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not much to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're getting hermaphrodites early
in flower, they must be removed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our environment dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to feed our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are scouting for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have applied our final pesticide
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have considered releasing predator
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to look for males and
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on the look for trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about a few things we can
do to improve the quality of our garden
[SPEAKER_00]: this early in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a trellis or a scrog
net, now is a good time to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: working those buds into the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still work those branches into the
net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stop doing it probably toward the
end of week three, but you've still got
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a branch that's popping up
too high, feel free to give it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: crack, bend it down under the net and work
it into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can keep working on a nice,
even canopy all the way through the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep popping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep twisting them and working them
into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked a lot about popping and
twisting in the beginning of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I continue to do this all the way
through weeks four and five, I will pop
[SPEAKER_00]: every stem right at the beginning of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it about two weeks to heal up and go
back and do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it about two weeks to heal up and go
back and do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab the base of the stalk,
grab it with your other hand and twist
[SPEAKER_00]: your top hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you twist, you'll hear a little
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that heals, it will create a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That knuckle will make a strong spot in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do that toward the entire plant
is covered in knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really knurled and I feel like
that that plant is very productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice thick stalk that can hold
a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hold fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got nice thick stalks that can
move a lot of water, which can carry a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it is a very beneficial
thing to crack all of the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continue working your plants into the
trellis if you're using a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue cracking and popping the sticks
to make robust plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to do a bit of lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some crappy branches on the
bottom of the plant, feel free to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got branches that come off the
very bottom of the plant and reach up
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the top and those top branches,
the tops have potential to create good
[SPEAKER_00]: usable buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean up the bottom suckers off of
that long branch and keep that arm and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a bud at the end of the arm and take
off all that little crap at the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: it that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very common to see plants that are
three and four feet tall that are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely naked for the first 18 inches
of the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a bunch of sticks coming out of
the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any little branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any tiny bud sites for 18
inches to maybe even two feet off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, depending on the growers
environment and the growers style and what
[SPEAKER_00]: type of lights they are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to get in there and cut out
any shitty branches that aren't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be productive and feel free to clean up
all that stuff real down low on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not going to get any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When harvest time comes, we're going to
have to trim everything we cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut all that little fluffy crap off
the plant, you don't have to trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're saying, yeah, I could have used
that for concentrates or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it all off the bottom,
we can move that energy right up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of growing that crappy little
fluff at the bottom, we just basically
[SPEAKER_00]: moved that up to that top cola to make all
those top buds just that much heavier,
[SPEAKER_00]: that much fatter, that much more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean up any crap on the bottom that
may be slowing your plants down and move
[SPEAKER_00]: that energy right up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I find advantageous is
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of debate in the cannabis
industry about how to defoliate,
[SPEAKER_00]: what level to defoliate and when to
defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do kind of a hard defoliation
right at the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a large leaf shadowing another
branch or shadowing another bud site,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will remove that leaf without question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll go through the grow and anything
with a purple petiole gets removed at the
[SPEAKER_00]: very start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this in a commercial environment for
several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing all of those extra leaves removes
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are less places for pests to hide
and there are less places for pathogens to
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remove the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it reduces humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without as many leaves doing as much
transpiration and respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit less moisture in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it easier to balance the
humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think a well timed, well executed
defoliation will increase the vigor of our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people will say you don't
want to pull off the leaves because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where the sugars are stored and they're
going to use that for nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are feeding the shit out of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to use anything that is
stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are pouring expensive nutrients into
these plants on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about the stuff stored in
those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to replace that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another argument to the defoliation is
that those leaves are used as solar panels
[SPEAKER_00]: and they need to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where sometimes a leaf is blocking a bud
site or if you remove that leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be more beneficial to put the
light closer to the bud than on that big
[SPEAKER_00]: old solar leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So selectively remove your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new at defoliating, go in and
just tear off a few leaves and see how the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next time, take off a few more
and see how the plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa leaning strains won't react as well
as indica leaning strains will react too
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I'll recommend is leave
those two leaves at the top of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have one bud, your main top
sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the top of that, there are two
leaves sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look in the grow room,
you'll see the two leaves I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave those on every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two mains that are sticking out of
the top of the main bud, I like to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: those until late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quite often, those will be the only
large leaves I leave on every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend a semi heavy defoliation
here at the beginning of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll do it again around week four
and we'll do it again around week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliating and cracking and twisting and
working into trellis work is kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to get good at this over
time, which will require confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made countless mistakes in my own
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made mistakes in commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made tiny mistakes and I have made
huge mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I became a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience includes mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the last crop you are going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a practice crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one will be your pro crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't act like these plants are the last
plants you're ever going to get to touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build some confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get in there and break some
shit and ruin some shit so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see what can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next grow will be really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to wreck some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to cause some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you learn things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If every grow goes smoothly for you,
you're going to think growing is easy and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to learn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your ego is going to get in the way
and that's when you're really going to run
[SPEAKER_00]: into problems and then you will have no
idea how to solve them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and play with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may kill one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may kill two, but you will learn what
they contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are way more resilient than
you would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first grow, if this is
your second grow, you're probably touching
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants like they're delicate little
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see me in a commercial
environment, you're going to think I am an
[SPEAKER_00]: abusive ogre to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then at the end, you will see the
highest quality, most beautiful buds come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of these plants that I kind of beat up
through their whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really care for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have a passion for the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm going really fast and I
don't have time for boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get a lot of stuff done in a
small amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get a little rough and
sometimes it looks like I'm being
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive and I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, the plants show
me that they were satisfied with what I
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are used to being outside
growing on a hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are used to being stuck in
one place and can't walk away when shit
[SPEAKER_00]: gets weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been beat up by nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them probably got peed on by a
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are amazingly resilient
plants and they can take some abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's abuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's beat them up a little bit and see
what they can take because I think when we
[SPEAKER_00]: push them to their limits, that's when we
see their full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to get in there and
break some shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be your last crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that seeds and clones are
very expensive and that this crop means a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can take one plant and dedicate
it to experiments, you can learn a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot from that one plant and still produce
a very viable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're new at defoliating,
if you're new at popping and twisting,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're new at cracking the stems,
maybe just pick one plant, defoliate the
[SPEAKER_00]: crap out of one plant and then don't do
the others and pay attention to what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something very important to note here,
take a lot of notes when you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down what you did to plant A,
write down what you did to plant B,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take great notes of the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to have documentation
to find out if the techniques and methods
[SPEAKER_00]: you were using work for your garden and
work for you and work for the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: strength chain which you are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before, but most of us
growers are also consumers, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes we may forget some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write some shit down and you will not
forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when the end comes and plant B is
way better than plant A, you know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what you did to make plant B stand out
from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can improve upon that and have a
better garden each and every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to experiment with one or two
plants in the garden until you develop
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence and while you're experimenting,
make sure to take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing I want to talk about
before we start wrapping up the show is
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs and lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we approach the third week of flower,
it is time to remove our metal halide bulb
[SPEAKER_00]: and start using the high pressure sodium
bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an LED, it's time to
switch from the blue to the more red
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum if that is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave my veg bulbs in for the
first couple of weeks of flower because I
[SPEAKER_00]: find it helps reduce the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first 21 days of flower,
our plants are going to take off and
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch extremely fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper nutrients will help reduce the
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right amount of phosphorus and
potassium will reduce the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I feel like keeping in the blue
light, the metal halide light for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two weeks of flower will really help
keep the plants short and squat and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are approaching the end of the
stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to swap out that blue bulb for
the yellow orange reddish bulb,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be the high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have not already changed out
your bulb or hit the switch on your LED to
[SPEAKER_00]: change into the flowering mode,
now is the time to swap out those bulbs or
[SPEAKER_00]: hit that switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't wait any later than day 21 to
change my flowering spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any later than that, we start hitting a
point of diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do reduce the stretch, but we also
reduce the bulking when it comes time to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we are caught up on weeks two
and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our nutrients covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our environment dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have applied our final pesticide
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have released our predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to do so, we're going to
continue popping the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue working the tall
plants into the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep defoliating as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have selected a plant to do
some experiments on and you are taking
[SPEAKER_00]: good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are well into the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need to continue keeping our eyes
open for males and hermaphrodites and
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants as well as pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we haven't made any nutrient
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we haven't had any pH issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we haven't had any light leaks,
we're developing bud set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like dandelions forming on the
tips of all of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we have removed all of the males
from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still keeping an eye out for males
and hermaphrodites and mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as long as we don't run into any
equipment failures or human errors,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are well on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on our way to a great harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.

[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with a fresh new

[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to joining you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend mangled remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 383 of the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find them at www.dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of goat power
from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at their Pueblo medical
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label on this concentrate says
it is 74.8% THC and 86.4% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have ever smelled or smoked golden
goat, this is exactly what golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a fresh smell so I can give
you a fair description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not overpowering citrus, but it does have
a citrus base to it with a tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: pineapple and a juicy fruit gum sort of
aroma on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus that stickiness that a juicy fruit
piece of gum would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's weird to say something smells
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that stickiness is part of the
flavor and aroma of the gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that tropical sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of pineapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly a citrus and tropical fruit sort of
a thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really describe it as a orange
pineapple tropical fruit jolly rancher
[SPEAKER_00]: would probably be the most accurate
description that I could nail it down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a beautiful golden color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just the right amount of
diamonds, just the right amount of sauce
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful goat power from our
friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously it has got me amped up and
ready to talk my face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: in-depth grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In episode 351, we talk about setting a
goal for the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talk about picking a space for the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talk about the appropriate
equipment and setting up the gross safely
[SPEAKER_00]: and effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we work our way through getting
clones and starting a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we are all the way to week
four of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
weeks four, five and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower or if you're new to
the podcast, I suggest you head back to
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 351 and start with the grow
lessons there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an experienced grower or if you
feel like you were up to speed or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been following along, let's jump
right into a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we are going to focus on
episodes four five and six of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point of flowering, it should be
obvious where the bud sites are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have little buds popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should look like little dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to actually form into
buds by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be clearly obvious where the
buds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should also be more than obvious which
plants are males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the males better be gone by now or
you have pollinated everything and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a seeded crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the males are gone at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point your buds are starting to
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing little pistol, hairy covered
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to get minimal bud mass at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also coming out of that rapid
stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first three weeks of flowering,
our plants really like to stretch and take
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty much over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are still going to get taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that top bud grows gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that rapid stretch phase is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to worry so much about the
plants just taking off on us anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to stop stretching and
they're going to start focusing their
[SPEAKER_00]: energy more on developing the fat chunky
buds we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point, if you don't have a
carbon filter, it is really time to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any air exiting the grow
going outside that the neighbors may
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, you need a carbon filter by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to start getting really
aromatic from here on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your odor under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before, a very common way for
your garden to be discovered is for the
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma to be noticed by a neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neighbors call the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police drive around the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: They narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knock on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they hit the front porch,
they can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come knock on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a legal state, they want to
count your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got law enforcement in the house,
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a non-legal area,
if whoever shows up at your front door
[SPEAKER_00]: feels that they have got probable cause to
come into your house, they can come.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can discover your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be handy with the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may speak well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may know how to keep them out of the
house for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the aroma was strong enough,
if their suspicion was strong enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to contact the judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have a warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in several days, they will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pull off the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will come in armed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be scary as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will destroy your entire garden and ask
questions later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is the time to have a carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be thinking about safety and
security if you are growing in a legal or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't even notice how pungent
your garden is because you're there every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first time the mailman walks in
front of the house and catches a little
[SPEAKER_00]: whiff, he's going to know exactly what
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time a little bit of aroma wafts
out of your grow and hits your neighbor
[SPEAKER_00]: right in her nose, she's going to know
exactly what that aroma is immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this scenario, we are only four weeks
into flower and our plants are beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: By weeks seven, eight, and nine,
it is going to be pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we start harvesting these
plants and trimming the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that aroma is going to increase
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add that extra stress to yourself by
stinking up the entire neighborhood with
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that buying a carbon filter
and an extraction fan sound like just
[SPEAKER_00]: another expense to a new grower,
but I would much rather invest that money
[SPEAKER_00]: in a filter and a blower than my lawyer
and bail.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I've made my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have one now, it is time to
start taking the steps to get a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like that's a good
overview of what's going on in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds are showing, the stretch phase is
over, and it is starting to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the environment in
our grow for weeks four, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a daytime temperature for weeks four,
five, and six, I would suggest a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you can dial it in a little
tighter, I would like to be between 74 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now during the night, I would suggest a
temperature in the range of 60 to 70
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can dial it in nice and tight,
I would recommend 65 to 68 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to suggest no more than a
10 degree difference in your day and night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is if your day temperature
is 77 degrees, you don't want your night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature any lower than 67 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to see any more than a 10
degree diurnal temperature variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we allow drastic temperature drops in
the night cycle, we will slow down the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth, and we will also encourage
powdery mildew development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, during the day, we want to be
between 70 and 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, we want to be between 60 and 70
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as time goes on, we're going to want
to reduce the temperature of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in flower, we want to make the room
a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are struggling to get the room
to 74 at this point, maybe just keep it up
[SPEAKER_00]: there at 78, 79 degrees, so that when
weeks eight and nine come around,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can reduce that temperature down to as
low as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lowest you can get it is 74,
let's wait until weeks eight and nine to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it there and leave it around 77 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know a lot of people are going to
say, why do we want to make it cooler?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about a plant outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the seasons change, it gets colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows, oh shit, the end of the season
is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will encourage the plant to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also encourage beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also encourage more terpene
production, heat and light breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not make it a little bit cooler
where we can preserve a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel that that little bit of cold
toward the end will increase in density.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get tighter, more dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also will help reduce humidity and late
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a little bit less humidity because
we've got those big chunky buds and we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to develop bud rot in the
middle of our flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing the temperature later in
flower has many advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that not all rooms are set up
to be able to reduce the temperature late
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be running a perpetual cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just simply may not have the equipment
to get it that cool in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a little bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little tip and trick that may help
increase aroma and color and density and
[SPEAKER_00]: also help you avoid powdery mildew and boy
tritus toward the end of your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why I suggest reducing the
temperature late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk more about that as we move
through these grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: For weeks four, five, and six,
I suggest 40% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reduced the humidity by 10% from
last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need as much moisture in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to develop buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds act like sponges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will gather all of that moisture in
the air, which will lead to boy tritus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is our worst nightmare when we get
giant buds in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's reduce the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it down to about 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about
nutrients for weeks four, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't give detailed information
when I talk about nutrients in these grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because I don't know what brand of
nutrients you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using powder
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're running organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what you have chosen to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be too specific with the nutrient
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can do is make sure we cover the
bases and I give you a solid foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the things I would make sure
to have in my nutrient mix for weeks four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running bottles, you need a
basic bloom nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a bottle that says bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a bottle that says bloom A
and a bottle that says bloom B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bottles are what we need for this
stage of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that those bottles have
three numbers printed on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an NPK value.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of flowering, we do not need
a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need a lot of nitrogen to provide
energy to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of flowering, we need more
phosphorus and potassium than we have
[SPEAKER_00]: previously needed in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will see a low N number and higher
P and K value numbers on your bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing with bottles,
hopefully your bloom base has covered your
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also need CalMag at this phase of
the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend enzymes and microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also introduce a kelp product to
my feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think kelp has a lot of great benefits
that we will talk about in a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a great time to start
introducing a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know what products you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what brand you have chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most bottle nutrients offer a very obvious
bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to start implementing that
into your feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to provide energy to
your plants, you can feed them a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate product at this stage of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbohydrates will give the plants
energy and the carbohydrates will also
[SPEAKER_00]: feed your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing with veg bloom powdered
nutrients, I would have added Shine by
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely would put Shine in there by
week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is basically the time I start tapering
off the microbe products and start adding
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bloom booster products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots should be big and fat and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time the plant is done,
I want that plant to be nearly root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are well on our way to filling that
pot with roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to start focusing on moving
that energy up top and making big giant
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through weeks four, five and six,
I start tapering off the microbes and I
[SPEAKER_00]: start increasing the bloom booster
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now be careful with your bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to overfeed the bloom
booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most bottle nutrient companies have a very
clear suggested dose printed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time that is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to feed your plants too much
so that you have to buy more of their
[SPEAKER_00]: product more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that a new grower starts
off with 50% of the recommended bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: booster dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you add that bloom booster
to your plant feed, only put 50% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended dosage and see how the plants
respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants don't show any sign of burn
or stunted growth, maybe increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding just a little bit next time and
increase it until you see the leaf tips
[SPEAKER_00]: just barely burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call it getting their nails done
because it starts to look like the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fingers are just getting their
fingernails on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them starting to get their
nails done, that's when you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing them to their limit and they're
just starting to get burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either give them that much again
and just keep burning them just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit or you can reduce it a little bit but
do not go any harder with the bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: booster once you see the fingernails start
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it sounds natural and feels natural to
want to add more bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give you bigger fatter
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a point of diminishing
returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add too much, it will burn the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants begin to burn,
it will start to lock out nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they lock out nutrients, it will not
take any of your bloom booster and it all
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes a waste of money and you have a
shitty harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't over bloom boost your plants five or
six weeks into flower and completely burn
[SPEAKER_00]: them and make them look like shit and ruin
your crop when you've only got three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those are just the basic nutrients I
would recommend if you are growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every company is going to have other
products to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies may offer a silicate
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies may offer a terpene
enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies may recommend a blood
hardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what company you have chosen
but be careful when adding your additives
[SPEAKER_00]: and just pay attention when mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that your pH is correct and try
to make note of your EC or your PPMs if
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're growing with organics,
if you're growing with super soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have probably mixed up your soil at
the beginning and there's not a lot you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do to it at this point other than
adding teas or maybe adding a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: or possibly a top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be quite honest with you, that is not
my area of expertise if you are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing organically and you
want to boost up your plants a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably suggest a compost tea
that included worm castings and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably include some sort of guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I am not the organic expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the no-till guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a super soil guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly grow in a commercial
environment and I grow from bottled and
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the advice and guidance that I
give you on this show will be based on
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled or powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that covers the basics of
nutrients for weeks four, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we want to give them a solid
NPK, a little bit of CalMag, some enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: some microbes, some carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would introduce kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would introduce a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically at this point, I would start
reducing the microbe products and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: start replacing the microbes with a bloom
booster product over the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I feel like we know what type of
environment to keep these plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we know how to feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what's going on in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what can we do to these plants to
increase production?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to make sure they stay
healthy and pest free all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the flowering cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we need to keep in mind is that
we need to be very selective on sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: this late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer not to spray anything at
all on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do run into issues, there are
very limited options of products we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use to spray on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do our best at this point to keep
bugs out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should already be implementing an
integrated pest management system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes a spray rotation and
possible release of predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also avoid going to other gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have friends that grow,
I would stay away from their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also never take anybody else into
my grow, especially other friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're inviting their spider mites right
into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, change clothes if you go to another
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in a commercial grow and have
a private grow at home, change clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: between those grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend changing clothes
between stops at the grow store and going
[SPEAKER_00]: to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go straight from the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are picking shit up at the grow store
all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the dirty growers are going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the soil is being shipped there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a hot bed for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take your pests from the grow store
right to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend a dedicated pair of
shoes for the garden or for the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in multiple facilities,
I would have a pair of shoes for the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have a pair of shoes that I wore
after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would have a different pair of
shoes that I put on to go in my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you have an outdoor grow and an
indoor grow, change clothes and shoes
[SPEAKER_00]: between those gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really tedious and it sounds
like overkill, but we do not want to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread spider mites from one garden to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most obvious and easy way for mites to
spread is for them to travel on a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do our best as responsible
growers, as responsible farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: to not spread spider mites to our other
grows and to our friends' grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy to get rid of spider
mites early in flower and veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a pain in the ass to get rid of
spider mites late in bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not drag them into the bloom
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have multiple rooms or multiple
facilities and you do find a pest issue in
[SPEAKER_00]: one area, treat that area as a
contaminated space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notify everybody that works there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there are spider mites in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in here unless it is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you do have to go in that area,
make sure you change clothes before
[SPEAKER_00]: entering another grow area and carrying
those spider mites throughout the facility
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one room that is not infested
with mites and you have another room that
[SPEAKER_00]: is infested with mites, work on the clean
room first when you get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all the work that needs to be done in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close that room up and be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go to that spider mite room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your work in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're done, leave the grow
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove your clothes, clean them,
put them in the laundry and don't take
[SPEAKER_00]: those dirty clothes back into that clean
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on the clean room first, then work on
the dirty rooms last.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we don't drag those spider mites
into the room that is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know that one room is
contaminated and you have to go in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost suggest a lab coat or a
Tyvek suit that you can swap between
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to go into the mited room,
throw on the lab coat, throw on the Tyvek
[SPEAKER_00]: suit, go into the spider mited room,
do what you need to do, come out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: room, remove the lab coat or Tyvek suit,
replace it with a fresh lab coat or Tyvek
[SPEAKER_00]: suit, and then go into the room that you
need to work in next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I know this sounds tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this sounds like overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine if you've got 500 plants in
one room and you're expecting to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: over 100 pounds and we just dragged spider
mites into there from the other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got one room that is almost
ready to harvest and we've been fighting
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost through that battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just walked into the other room and
were five weeks into flower and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped a spider mite bomb in there
because you were lazy and didn't bother to
[SPEAKER_00]: change your lab coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small problems are small problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are small problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we go to a large scale
cultivation facility, a very small problem
[SPEAKER_00]: will multiply overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those spider mites are going to have a
party when we turn off the lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody goes home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will come in the next morning and now
it is spider mite world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do our best to not introduce
spider mites to the grow because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: very limited on plans of attack to get rid
of those mites in this point of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very limited sprays we can
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we can do, we can release
predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you were planning ahead,
part of your integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: system did include ordering predator bugs
to be released early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully around week three, you released
an army of predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if any spider mites do show up,
those predators are already colonized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already there claiming their turf
and no spider mites will start infesting
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you didn't get those predator bugs
in there early, it is not too late to
[SPEAKER_00]: order predators to come attack your spider
mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to act quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say I'll order them Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see spider mites in the grow,
order those predator mites today.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that box of predator mites comes,
you need to stop what you were doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: release those bugs into the garden
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to win the war.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to release our troops to get in
there and destroy those spider mites that
[SPEAKER_00]: are sucking the juices out of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are destroying our potency and they
are diminishing our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get rid of them immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's too late to order them,
to spray, I highly suggest you order
[SPEAKER_00]: predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Order more than you think you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a large army to get in there and
wipe out the infestation as quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier I did say we are very limited
on the products we can spray to our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: this late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few beneficial fungus based
products that can be applied to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: this late in flower that will not affect
the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you understand the products you are
using, you can apply a sprayed pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can release predators and they
will work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper pesticide at this stage of the
game will not harm your flowers and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will not kill your predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I do not suggest spraying plants
with bulky flowers, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: something has to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a few spray application
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not spray anything oil based this late
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ruin the flavor and aroma of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only things I would recommend to spray
this late in flower would be beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus type products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never apply an oil this late in
flower and I don't even want to spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: unless it is absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather release the predators and
let them do their thing, but I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you're going to go into panic
mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's more than what the
predators can handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may have already purchased a
pesticide and you don't have funding to
[SPEAKER_00]: order insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand that things come up in a
garden and life does happen and we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: always control things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we can do from this situation is
take note.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try to understand how did we get
spider mites and how can we prevent this
[SPEAKER_00]: from happening next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to stop spraying the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also time to stop running the sulfur
burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a sulfur burner in your
grow, turn that shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is making your plants taste terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is making your concentrates taste
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop using sulfur burners in the
grow and let's start correcting the true
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is causing the powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: People use sulfur to prevent and cure
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we find the cause instead of
burning sulfur in the room and making the
[SPEAKER_00]: room smell like shit, making your buds
smell like shit, making your concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like shit, making the final product
completely taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out what's causing that powdery
mildew and cure that instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: burning sulfur in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know a lot of people have a sulfur
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is their method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to stop doing it because
I said so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's compromise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insist on using a sulfur burner in
your garden, perhaps you can stop using it
[SPEAKER_00]: around week three or around week four when
those buds start popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier in the episode, I suggested
reducing humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps reducing that humidity a little
bit will help prevent that powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're getting the fat buds,
we need to reduce humidity anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it a little cooler, reduce
humidity, and stop burning that sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure the product will taste
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever smoked a concentrate that
tasted like fish or fish oil, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: times that is because there was a sulfur
burner being used in the room during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more sprays and no more sulfur
burners after week three, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we are approaching week four,
it is time to reduce some of the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: stress we have been performing to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want to do some popping and
twisting and I still want to work them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the nets, but I don't want to go as
hard and as extreme as I was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to allow these plants to use their
energy on producing buds now and not
[SPEAKER_00]: recovering from all the popping and
breaking and not being stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to just focus on making fat,
chunky buds and sweet trichomes for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to reduce the stress a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean I'm going to stop
beating them up, but I am going to mellow
[SPEAKER_00]: out just a little bit on these girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to reduce the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a little less popping
and twisting, but we are still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop and twist the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to continue working these
plants into the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a trellis net and you've got
a plant that's taken off getting too tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be afraid to grab that one,
crack the stem and work it right back
[SPEAKER_00]: under the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: The start of week four is also a good time
to do our final bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got those little bud sets showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where the buds are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a stick with a bunch of
little tiny shitty buds on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just clean those little popcorn balls
right on off and leave that stuff at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the branch to develop into a nice
chunky bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I talked about
taking off all those little tiny sucker
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave the thick branches,
but those little buds that grow off the
[SPEAKER_00]: base of that branch toward the bottom,
those can get cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're just a waste of space and
energy and they're not going to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: anything except a pain in the ass,
you can cut those right off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers like to say that's what I was
going to make concentrate out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to make my edibles
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine if you want to leave that
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you cut that stuff off that
doesn't get a lot of light, you take that
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and you move it right up to the top
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of the plant feeding those 12
little tiny shit buds at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can just put that energy right up at
the top where it's getting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can use that energy to make that top
cola that much beefier, that much fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also sucks to trim that bottom stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to trim those little popcorn
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to waste time cutting that
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can cut something off to make
something better, why wouldn't you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to go do a final
bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean up that messy crap on the
bottom that's not going to turn into any
[SPEAKER_00]: usable bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also like to do a light defoliation
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf with a purple petiole will get
taken off at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big leaf, it's got a
purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that long purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead and break that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break that stem off as close to the
branch, as close to the bud as you can so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't leave that little stem there
with moisture hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just break that stem right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those leaves out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need all the excessive leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with a purple stem, I'll go
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do one layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say, yeah, I could do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll go back and take off more
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll stand back and look into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just try to make sure that I've
gotten all the giant leaves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: blocking the light from hitting the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can see light coming down and it's
hitting a leaf and I can clearly see that
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaf is hanging over a bud site,
I will remove that leaf so that bud site
[SPEAKER_00]: can get the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of old school growers are going
to tell you don't remove the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's where the nutrients and
sugars are stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm pretty sure earlier in this
episode, we talked about feeding these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants a whole bunch of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really a reason for these
plants to store nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are feeding the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are high performance plants that are
going to get a high performance meal every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need that stored stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pull those leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves will give us opportunity for
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are places for pests to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves have to come off when we trim
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not take those leaves off now and save
us the trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't go extreme and make the plants
naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off the leaves with the giant pedials
and the leaves that are in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of intimidating for new
growers and honestly this is an art and a
[SPEAKER_00]: skill that you will have to develop over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good way to practice defoliating and
seeing what happens to the plants is to
[SPEAKER_00]: get four plants of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got four clones of let's say
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got four Golden Goat plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not defoliate one really hard,
defoliate one kind of hard, defoliate one
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit and then don't defoliate the
other one at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take pictures if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take as many notes as you can and
then keep an eye on those notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and see which plant came out the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the plant that you left alone come out
the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the plant that we beat to shit and
almost made it naked come out the best or
[SPEAKER_00]: was it the one that's right in the middle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be strain specific on how
hard you want to go with defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most strains will benefit from a
medium defoliation and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely benefit from removing all those
super large leaves that are blocking your
[SPEAKER_00]: bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you go too hard, your plants will
look naked and the growth will stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't go extremely hard on your first
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and pull off some leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say this in the podcast all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take more off but you can never
glue those leaves back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull a few off, take a step back,
look at it, see what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take off more, get in there
and take them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're intimidated by it, leave the
leaves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will suggest is that if a leaf
is yellow or funky, you remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hesitate and don't be shy to take
down the ugly leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those yellow leaves are invitations for
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spider mite will see a yellow leaf and
they will head right to that leaf because
[SPEAKER_00]: it is weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outer layer isn't as thick and crunchy
so that spider mite can get its shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: little fangs right through that skin and
it can get right in there and start
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to deal with that thick
healthy plant flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of those yellow leaves and
remove them from the garden as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I would suggest at this
point in flowering is to increase airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a good time to add some fans to
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have an oscillating fan in
the room, now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those leaves rustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want those buds sitting still and
letting stagnant air build up in those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't want the plants being bent
over and getting shit whipped by the fan
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want every leaf to rustle
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want that fan to pass by and just
give those leaves just a little rustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stir the air just so that nothing can
get still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just move that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep doing this motion with my hand
like you guys can see me just moving that
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said earlier, our buds are
going to start developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start getting fat and
chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds work like sponges.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's too much moisture in the air,
that moisture will get trapped inside
[SPEAKER_00]: those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll start getting bud mold inside
the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a fan moving that air and
moisture around, that will reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for bud mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you're adding fans, you may need
to add some sticks or some sort of cages
[SPEAKER_00]: for supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using a trellis net,
your buds are going to start toppling
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not wait till weeks five and six
when those buds are big and chunky and
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky and they're falling over trying to
break the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start supporting these plants early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big long branch and you
can tell that it's going to turn into a
[SPEAKER_00]: giant bud, go ahead and stick a long stake
into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to cut up too many of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shove that stake straight into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that stick straight up sticking where
you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then use a twisty tie or a zip tie or
something gentle to just gently attach
[SPEAKER_00]: that topply stick to that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to squeeze that branch at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be loose so that you don't
pinch that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some freedom in there,
but you don't want it flopping around too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pinch or crush or squeeze the
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use a few stakes and stick them in the
dirt and have them sticking straight up
[SPEAKER_00]: and attach those floppy branches to those
stakes as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use a shit ton of stakes
in each pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you've got to do,
that's what you've got to do to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get some sticks or get some tomato
cages and be prepared to start supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your buds get so chunky that those
plants just want to fall right over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I hope for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also hope you've got some sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a tomato cage on hand so that those
plants don't die when that shit starts
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some sticks in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to focus on is to
continue scouting for pests and PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we're this late in flower
doesn't mean that problems can't arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eyes open for pests and powdery
mildew and boy tritus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while we're scouting for pests and
boy tritus, we also need to pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any nutrient burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any pH issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few crunchy leaves here and there,
that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few shitty leaves low in the canopy,
that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start getting large clusters of
shitty looking leaves, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that needs to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you are taking notes of what
you've been feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got some kind of record
of what the pH was that was going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you've even been taking notes of
what is coming out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been measuring the EC and pH of
your runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, that will help you diagnose
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a problem should arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you're scouting for pests and
while you're looking for nutrient issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: also don't forget about all of the
equipment in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do some visual inspections while
you're walking through the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, look, you may notice things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be paying attention to the plants
and the equipment while you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you're looking around for
equipment problems, you're looking around
[SPEAKER_00]: for pests, and we're also looking around
for yellow leaves, we still need to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: our eyes out for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing from seed, it is still
an opportunity to reveal hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_00]: traits this far into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your eyes out for herm flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've talked a little bit in a
previous episode about what to do if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do discover a hermaphroditic plant this
late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got several options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull out the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut off the main bud that's got
the male flowers on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut down the whole plant or you
can choose to ignore the immediate threat
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can keep an eye on that male
flower and see if it opens and drops
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind that if you do see male
flowers, you do run the risk of having
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen in that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point of flowering,
those female plants are really eager to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive that pollen and create seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep your eye open because it is not
too late to find hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that is always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eyes open through the entire
grow on your first or second run with the
[SPEAKER_00]: new cultivar or if you're growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, this episode is
starting to get long, so let's start
[SPEAKER_00]: recapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start wrapping up the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's recap week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week four, we are going to continue
working the plants into the nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to bottom the plants a little
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is the time to put on sticks or
tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to reduce the stress of the plants
and start letting the buds develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still need to work the plants and
pop the stems and defoliate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll work into week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when we're going to do our final
bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to finish bottoming the plants by
the end of week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do our final popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to let the plants just
settle in and develop buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do our final major defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to lightly defoliate
through harvest, but this is the last big
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation we will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also pull all of the shitty
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take off all the small popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any branches that don't look like they're
worth the shit will get taken out at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the last chance to get supports on
these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have some sticks or some
tomato cages in there now by week five,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to see problems in week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to start toppling
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is the time to get in there and
make sure you've got sticks and some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of twisty tie or something like that
holding your buds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also time to increase airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to start getting chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have the airflow moving,
now is the time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need a carbon filter in week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to recap that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered that very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in week six, we are going to need that
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better have those sticks and supports
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are done bottoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are done working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are done cracking, popping,
and twisting these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to let them grow and let the
buds get fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay on top of scouting for problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to pay attention to
environmental, nutrient, or pH stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we see anything caused by those
things, we need to adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my favorite part about weeks five and
six, this is when the good folks photos
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds are starting to get chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are nice and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the pistols are still nice and
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the leaves are still lush and
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a great time to start taking
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my favorite part of week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in week four, you got little nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got those little popcorn balls
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in week five, you're starting to get
actual buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the buds growing up the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to get chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in week six, you actually start
developing photogenic colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get in there and start taking
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing some beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to get some good colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week six is when it really starts getting
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the thing to think about is keeping
these plants healthy, pest free,
[SPEAKER_00]: problem free, all the way till the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep yourself out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start posting photos just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do take a sweet ass photo in week
six, I suggest you save it until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start flooding the pictures out after
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, nobody knows when you're cutting
down your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of a weed grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trick from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to start thinking about is,
is the next run ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to harvest these plants in
two to four weeks, depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have plants lined up for the next
run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have clones that are getting
rooted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ordered seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared for the next run?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to miss any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on top of the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels like a great opportunity to
pitch my seed vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some seeds, I highly recommend
the Hela Dank Seed Company and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find them at www.
[SPEAKER_00]: dankseed.store.

[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 385 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find them at www.dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Goat Power
Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This smells just like Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes just like Golden Goat and it has
got that sativa punch that Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a big fan of Golden Goat,
so this is a delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is 74.8% THC with a
total of 86.4% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like smoking the Goat Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets my brain fired up and it tastes
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a quality concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we are going to do weeks
seven through nine, we are wrapping up the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost time to harvest, so we're
going to talk about the final weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work our way into flushing and a
little bit of defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been following along,
I recommend you go back to episode 351 and
[SPEAKER_00]: start listening to the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an experienced grower or if
you've been following along or if you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like you were up to speed, let's jump
right into this grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of the flowering cycle,
we are entering what I call the third
[SPEAKER_00]: trimester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our plants are going to take
between eight and 10 weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think nine weeks is a good template to
set up these grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are going to take more than
nine weeks, I suggest you extend my advice
[SPEAKER_00]: for week seven one more week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just repeat the week seven feeding,
the temperature, the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just repeat week seven one more time if
you've got a longer flowering cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand if you're growing from
seed, you may not know how long your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to pay attention to
the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to be prepared to
flush about 10 or 14 days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to take a close eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay attention to your
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes when I'm running seeds that are
brand new and I don't know what to expect,
[SPEAKER_00]: I already decided they're going 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let them flower 70 days and see
what they give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I decide 70 days was too long,
I can run them less time next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to give them the opportunity to
show me what could happen if I go a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants really like to bulk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last week, some plants really put on
some extra trichomes that final week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants really don't do shit for that
last week, except over ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn your
specific cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, you will discover that nine
weeks is just about right for most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will take 10 weeks if you want to get
them perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are ready in eight weeks,
which is really advantageous because that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts us a week ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can produce another crop in a
commercial environment that really helps
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for these lessons, we're going to
focus on a nine week cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now at the start of week seven
in our flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, the buds are starting to
get really fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be getting really sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be putting off some very nice
aromas by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be starting to make some very
nice colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing from seed, different
phenotypes will start becoming very
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious at this point in the flowering
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one phenotype that has gotten
way taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a phenotype that has stayed
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one that is way branchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will really start seeing the different
traits now that we are later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week seven is what I call the fill
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds will really start filling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes will really start getting
dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the photos really start
getting hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think weeks six through nine are great
for photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only gets better as we go on until it
is time for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out your camera and take some great
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get good beefy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get good trichome
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soon, you're going to start getting
those sweet fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus in on the environmental
conditions for our grow room in week seven
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buds are getting big and beefy,
so we need to reduce the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have too much humidity in the room,
we do run the risk of bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run the risk of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's reduce the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring it down to around 30 or 40
percent relative humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help us reduce the risk of bud
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first change is that we should
reduce the humidity by five to 10 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I would recommend is to
reduce the temperature by just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been running our flowering room
somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees during
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to knock that down just three
to five degrees if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to get it 77 to 75 degrees in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the weeks go on, I would like to
reduce it about three to five degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: every week until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this week, let's drop it down by three
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already at 80 degrees,
let's get it down to 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're down at 77, let's crank it down
about 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make these plants think that winter
is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That colder environment will bring out
more colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That colder environment will bring out
more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That colder environment will make your
buds more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it also speeds up the
finishing time of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make it just a little bit colder
during week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about our nutrients for
week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be our last opportunity
for feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start reducing our base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need as much nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we have in the past, you can almost
eliminate the nitrogen at this phase of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to overfeed them,
but we do want to make sure that they get
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice boost for their last feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you include some phosphorus
and potassium to make those buds swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also include some Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too hard on the Kalmag at this
point because it is really hard to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: it out and you may taste it if you go too
hard with Kalmag at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always encourage a kelp product
this late in flower that will add to your
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like an enzymatic product this late
in flower because it keeps my root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use a microbe product this late in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mentioned that we should taper off
the microbes and start increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your budget will allow,
I would include microbe products this late
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the thing to focus on on this feeding
is one final bloom booster feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what product you're using as
a bloom booster, but this is probably your
[SPEAKER_00]: last opportunity to add that bloom booster
to your nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you get that in there at this
feeding time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last week to fertilize our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week we are going to begin the
flushing phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to boost those plants up
one last time, if you've been saving one
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of something or one little scoop of
something, this is the last time to
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize those plants because at the
start of week eight we are going to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point in the game we've got
big fat chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have to say this, but I want
to remind everybody it is too late to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray any pesticides on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are coming down in 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the plants to taste like
anything we applied as a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do not spray your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also do not use a sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned that in previous episodes
using a sulfur burner at this point in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower will make your plants taste like
total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will taste like smoking a pack of
matches or it will taste like smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: can of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please turn off the sulfur burner in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish everybody would just get rid of the
sulfur burner and find out what is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually causing the problem and cure the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no pesticides, no sulfur burners this
late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is acceptable is predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a pest issue, release an
excessive amount of predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've been on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you don't have a problem,
but I understand shit happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predator bugs are the way to go at this
stage of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little sachets that you hang,
the little tea bag looking things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too late for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the live predators that are ready
to release, that are hungry, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to get in there and destroy your
spider mites or whatever pest you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the live active bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more expensive,
but they're the only thing that are
[SPEAKER_00]: effective at this stage of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, do not spray anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use a sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do see any insects,
any pests, get in there with some predator
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, and hopefully those predators will
eradicate your infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do is defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do see any signs of pests,
remove any infested leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark the plant so that you know where that
infestation was and come check frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you can to minimize the problem in
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the game, I also suggest
you defoliate any yellow or funky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaves that look unhealthy are pest
attractants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get those dead funky leaves out of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate anything that is obvious that
needs to come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some nice fall looking
colors and you want to leave those pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on there for photos, you can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the minute it starts getting crunchy
and it is dead, decaying matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to come off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to have a few dead leaves at
this point in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a full grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a full canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some dead funky leaves in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a leaf just doesn't get enough
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a branch gets bumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have some funky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is excessive, you may have a problem
that needs to be diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a few funky leaves at this stage are
not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing we should keep our eyes
open for at this stage of the game are
[SPEAKER_00]: late flowering or hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be scouting daily for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be scouting daily for powdery
mildew and boy tritus.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that visual inspection,
you should also be looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top buds of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the middle buds of the plants and
definitely look at the lower part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant where you are not getting a lot of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any male flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what a male flower looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you identify a hermaphrodite flower
if it walked up and bit you on the nose?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I recommend you do a little bit of
Google research and know what a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite flower looks like so you do
not allow them to happen in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point of the game, we still
need to keep our eyes open for pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: mold problems and we also need to keep an
eye out for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've spoken in a previous episode
about how to handle the herms if you
[SPEAKER_00]: should get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray it with some water and think of your
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to remove the male flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to remove the bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to remove the branch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to get rid of that whole
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to make decisions
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is just one little hermaphrodite
flower, I would spray it with water,
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it out with tweezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two or three that are on one
bud, maybe cut that bud or that branch
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got several hermaphrodite
flowers popping up in different spots on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, it may be time to get rid of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of things to think about
because this late in flower, will those
[SPEAKER_00]: male flowers do anything to the rest of
your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just running one flowering
cycle, you're probably too late into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow to seed anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a perpetual cycle going on,
those plants that are earlier in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: may be ready to receive that pollen should
that hermaphrodite release pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you do have a hermaphroditic plant
in your grow room, don't give clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: that to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't pass out hermaphrodite clones
to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to continue to grow it,
that is fine, but don't give a herm out to
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're setting them up for failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do that to our friends
and fellow growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the last things I have written down
for week seven is plenty of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot of airflow in the grow room
as these buds start getting chunkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need more fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see every leaf move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need every plant and every leaf
getting beat down by the wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want every leaf just to get a little
rustle occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the fans oscillate, I want every fan to
just feel that fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just change that air around my leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know the environment is getting
shuffled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a bunch of CO2 in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a bunch of humidity packed
up over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mix that air all day long and
keep that air fresh for my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have plenty of airflow in your grow as
we get late into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing I want to talk about is
kind of preparing us for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plan to cut this crop down in
approximately 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have seeds or clones prepared for
your next run?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have another grow space,
now is the time to get your seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: clones prepared for your next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we don't have a bunch of
downtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way as soon as these plants are
harvested, you can move fresh plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: into that grow room and never miss a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I do plan on updating my
perpetual grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did write a very long perpetual grow
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is episode 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in scheduling a
perpetual grow, go check out episode 73,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will update that because in
Colorado, we have made quite a few changes
[SPEAKER_00]: to our laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to write a perpetual grow episode
based around our Colorado plant count
[SPEAKER_00]: limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is coming in the future,
but let's focus on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get plants prepared for your
next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got an available veg space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is the time to buy clones or
acquire clones from either your fellow
[SPEAKER_00]: growers or a dispensary or however you get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or now is the time to start germinating
seeds and getting them started so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when that grow room is empty, we can clean
it up and we can refill it and you never
[SPEAKER_00]: miss a day in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the basics of week seven of the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move right into week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week eight, we want to continue to
reduce the temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that humidity down between 25
and 35% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will make it a little bit dry in the
room for the last two weeks, but it will
[SPEAKER_00]: also help us prevent powdery mildew and
boy tritus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get mold right up the
center of our big giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by reducing the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we can do is we can reduce
the temperature by three to five degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point of the phase, I would like
to be somewhere between 70 and 74 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit during the lights on cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now week eight is what I call the final
swell week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see your buds take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start becoming covered in
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to really start paying
attention to your trichomes with a 60 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 X powered microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get in there and look at those
trichome heads, see what color they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting that milky whitish blue
color?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they started becoming amber?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how you determine the ripeness of
your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's time to get in there and start
paying close attention to the trichomes on
[SPEAKER_00]: our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these plants are also going to be
super sticky and super stinky,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they should also be putting off some
amazing colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is another great opportunity to
take more photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we enter the flush phase, we will start
seeing more colors come from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start removing nutrients
from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to push some of the color out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the green is going to disappear,
which will allow room for reds and golds
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of great colors that you didn't
know were coming from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be an exciting two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've reduced the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reduced the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's start flushing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done an entire episode on flushing
our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is episode 320.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into great detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly here, I will explain how and why
we flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past at least nine weeks,
we have been shoving nutrients into these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are filled with a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want to smoke all of those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are stored in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are stored within that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: By flushing the plant, we are starving it
of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make that plant use up all of the
nutrients stored within its systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also remove all of the nutrients
from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically want to wash out the
medium to make no nutrients available,
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow that plant to starve itself so
that it will use up all of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that is stored over its flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: By removing the nutrients from all of the
buds, it will make the buds burn and smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and taste much better if they are properly
dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need to get all the way through a
harvest and drying cure phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at this point, flushing is the first
step to getting a tasty final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water the plants, don't add any
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust the pH somewhere between
6.2 and 6.5 and just water the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: until you get 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pour in a gallon of water in a pot,
you want 20% of that gallon to run right
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bottom of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them a few heavy waterings and you
will wash out all of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just continue to water until harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is simple and it is free and it will
make your plants taste so much better if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever smoked flowers that taste
like you just stuck your tongue in a light
[SPEAKER_00]: socket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are those buds were not flushed
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person did not allow a 10 to 14 day
flush phase before he harvested his plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and now they taste like complete shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it a couple times already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you want to do free shit to your
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to use nutrients and it
saves time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is fill the container
with water, adjust the pH, pour it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: damn plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flush the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we are going to focus on in
weeks 8 through 9 is flushing the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for harvest so that they taste good once
we dry and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before I harvest, I like to do a
pre-harvest defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally like to do this 7 to 10 days
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may happen in the middle of week 8
or at the beginning of week 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaf that has a petiole that I can
grab, I just go in there and peel it right
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a bunch of leaves at this
point of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves have done their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost time to cut down these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make the harvest crews job just
a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to go through and pull off all
of the big leaves 7 to 10 days before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a good way to segue us right
into week number 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of week 9, if you haven't
done it already, feel free to go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and pull off all of the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves have done their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take them off of there and get them
out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the environmental
conditions in our grow room for week 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the final week of our flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to reduce the humidity to
approximately 25 to 30 percent humidity at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buds are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buds are chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to risk bud rot in the
middle of those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reduce that humidity down to about 25
percent relative humidity in my flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to get it nice and reach the
end of their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I try to make it a little
colder in the grow room at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that a lot of growers like
to do at the end of a flowering cycle is
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, you're probably running 12 on
and 12 off toward the end of the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always reduce it to 10 on and 14
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing your light cycle will also make
the plants think that the end is near.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will speed up a little bit and they
will finish more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that having it a little bit cooler
and having a little less light in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the plants finish a little sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes them pack on a little more
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the buds a little more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I think it gives us a little
more terpene presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are destroyed by light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are destroyed by warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not give them a little cool and a
little dark and we can have a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also saving a little bit of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using nutrients because we're
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're running the lights for two
hours less per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're saving electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saving the electricity on running
the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, we're probably saving a little bit
of electricity on cooling since we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to cool to fight those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're saving electricity and we're also
saving time on our gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not reduce the lights just a couple
of hours at the last week of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's a little secret that I haven't
shared with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that takes way too
long to flower and you need to speed it up
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit, you can reduce those
lights by four hours at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and those plants will finish
approximately a week earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a 10 week strain or an 11
week strain and at the end of week nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you crank those lights down to eight hours
on and 16 hours off, that plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: finish one solid week early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may not get the harvest weight you
would get if you let it go for that full
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 or 12 week period, but sometimes we
just need the plants to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is always a trick you can use to
speed up some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have reduced humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reduced our temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have reduced our light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on the final home stretch here in
week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, please do not apply any
pesticides or any foliar feeds to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants this late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ruin the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week is our final bulking and
ripening week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see that final bulk come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting fat and chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your leaves are going to start
getting yellow and starting to droop down
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a little crinkly because we've
been flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you're paying attention to
those trichomes because this is when the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes are really going to start
turning amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And showing their progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week nine is the bulk and ripen week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost time to chop down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep a close eye on the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide the plants are not done and
you want to let them go a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer, you can let them flower for an
extra week and you don't have to give them
[SPEAKER_00]: any more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess your whole cycle up by adding
nutrients in and then trying to cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: down seven days later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already been flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already doing it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess it up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it needs to go longer, let it go
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are early in flower and you
anticipate you may need an extra week or
[SPEAKER_00]: two, again, repeat my advice from week
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week seven is where you extend your
schedule if you're going to go longer than
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's act like we are right on
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ending up week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have defoliated the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't ran into any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing to think about is do you
have your harvest and drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: area prepared?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready for a sticky, stinky,
time consuming and space consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cut down the plants, where are
you going to hang them?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be there for at least a
week, maybe seven to 14 days, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have space for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will people be showing up?
[SPEAKER_00]: When people show up, are they going to
smell your hanging plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to plan ahead to keep that
aroma away from visitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to do something to keep
intruders and thieves away from that
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to start thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to say, hey, it's the time
to cut down these plants and walk in there
[SPEAKER_00]: with scissors and cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, the next step in my
grow lessons is harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next step is to harvest these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is only followed by drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next step after that is to clean
and reset our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've made it this far,
you are one episode from cutting down your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, all we've got to do is
dry it and cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the step after that is finally
sampling our finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've made it all the way through
nine weeks of flowering without any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did run into issues, I hope you
were able to solve those problems without
[SPEAKER_00]: messing up your crop.

I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a tradition that I start the
podcast off by letting you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous dab of Stardog
Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows I love the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a great podcast intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along with the
podcast, you know that I've been doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: long series of Grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be a repost of an
episode about determining ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was originally posted as episode
number 319.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode does feature White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original episode was about 45 minutes
long, but I cut out the part about
[SPEAKER_00]: determining ripeness, and that was
approximately 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to be out of town for a couple of
days this week, so I won't be able to put
[SPEAKER_00]: together a quality podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this episode about determining
ripeness, and I feel like it falls
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly in line with the Grow series
that we have been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado,
let's jump right into this old school
[SPEAKER_00]: episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast featuring White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is episode 319,
determining ripeness, reposted as episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 387.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to

[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 319 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table is White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking time out of the busy
schedule of two kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup, dos ninos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dos ninos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can tell where we're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a show from Pueblo,
Colorado, where the white guys speak real
[SPEAKER_00]: good Spanish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just in an Instagram live feed and
somebody's trying to throw out some German
[SPEAKER_00]: and I responded in German and the whole
room just went silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire chat stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Mike's on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a show about ... What
are we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Determining ripeness and when to harvest
your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I like to start the
episodes by stocking about ... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about what I've been dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of some Viola Labs
Clementine Cookies live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm opening it up to smell it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like spicy orange candy and I really
love the smell and flavor of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up three grams today when I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just get one gram of each
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, do they have more of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take three and I will be on my
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, is it time to change that microphone
cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're subliminally telling
me right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a furry spot, but I've got my own
mute, so I'm used to furry spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to blame that on your
Malamutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Malamute hair, but it's not
hippie hair either, so I'm cool just
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling it off and rolling with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we might want to look for a new
cover after this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the furry spot podcast,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be that kind of show people
tune in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put this show back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of spots we should
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at the Hela Dank
Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're drinking water now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Mike is drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rare occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't pack properly for this mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some water's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some water anyway, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel bad for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you went and spilled half of it right
down your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's drinking water, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a rare occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, the Hela Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support our friends at the Hela Dank Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, support more of my friends,
PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I know you want to know what's going
on in your grow room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're away and you're like,
I wonder if that air conditioner clicked
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty hot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that air conditioner is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even think about what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, ah, is that air conditioner
working?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to drive home and look,
but you can't drive home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bust out your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your PLMinder unit and you can
see what's going on in your grow room at
[SPEAKER_00]: all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get a PLMinder unit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to plgrow.systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out, plgrow.systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, PL Grow Systems Minder Unit will
let you know what's going on in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can enjoy what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, all of the YouTube videos are
caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a long time, but they are finally
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a multi-year project.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube got evil right before confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the scariest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about caught up and then all of
the YouTube channels started disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put videos of myself consuming on
this channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be your saving grace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk heavily about it, but they don't
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they're looking for it and someone
reports it, we should be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how long it lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, if it does disappear,
I'll find a new place to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is ... That's just another place
for more people to listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll probably get more listens,
more views, more interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you got anything to say before we
start talking about determining ripeness
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got any topics you want to bring
before we get on a ramble here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just see where it takes us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike says, we'll see where this takes us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were talking on Instagram
Live and on chat rooms right now about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to decide when to harvest their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When is my cannabis ripe?
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed packs are going to tell you a
certain timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say 56 to 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say 63 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say nine to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you run that pack of seeds,
I would say go the longest timeframe that
[SPEAKER_00]: they give you as an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least plan for it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says nine to 10 weeks, go the 10
weeks because maybe in that last week,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you're going to see extra
trichomes pack on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see the extra weight come
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see maybe some cool
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some shit you don't see if you
cut it down at week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go 10 weeks if it says 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says 56 to 63 days, let it go 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go 65 if it looks okay and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, the way to determine
ripeness of your cannabis plants is not by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not by looking at the shape of the
butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did air quotes when I said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing different people throughout my
cannabis career speaking at length about
[SPEAKER_01]: how all of those are telltale signs of
either perfect or good or completed or not
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to harvest or it's all nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're growing cannabis for,
the viable part that we want are the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we look at anything but the
trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to harvest those when they're at
their ripest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be paying attention to the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you can do that, you can,
if somebody tells you they can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes with their naked eye,
either steal their eyes or kick them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dick because they're a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot see amber trichomes without
some sort of magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need at least 60X, maybe 100X
magnification to see if a trichome is
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, cloudy, silver, milky, amber,
busted, ruptured.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the head's broken off of it,
you need magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot see that with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, you're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start looking at scopes, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself like a jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a scope from DinoLite that hooks up
to my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plug it right into the USB slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me just a few minutes to mess with
the drivers to make it link up to my
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it linked up, it was no problem ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open up the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to run the scope over the plants
and I can focus it in and I can see those
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes very large on my computer screen
and I can take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can't tell exactly what I'm looking
at, I can reach over and I think I press
[SPEAKER_00]: F11 and I take a photo right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can go look later and I can see if
that plant's ripe or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The computerized scope makes life a lot
easier, but you can pick up something kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a jeweler's loop that's a lot less
expensive and just as functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 420 scope will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a basic jeweler's loop will work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that Hydrofarm sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got batteries in it and then it
splits in half and the batteries are in
[SPEAKER_00]: one side and the optics are actually in
the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a 60 and a 100X.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend the 100X if you go for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the best one on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to get something like that
that I'm aware of, there's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: something better by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnification will help you out in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell if your trichomes
are clear, if they're silver, if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudy, if they're milky, if they're
amber, if they're ruptured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you'll be able to identify the pests
and the funguses and the problems on the
[SPEAKER_00]: underside of your leaves more accurately
if you've got a scope to look at those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really useful tool throughout the
growth cycle for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, once you've got all of your tools
dialed in and you've got some money to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend on a couple of extra toys for the
grow room, get yourself a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will really help.
[SPEAKER_00]: A scope or a loop or something that hooks
up to your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the hairs are not going to
tell you how ready your plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike just tapped his headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you too hot there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just kind of itch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, scratch it up, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His leg's starting to go because he's
scratching behind his ear, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little twitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that's going to tell you if
you're going to grow a tricombs,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to grow a tricombs,
if you're going to grow a tricombs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll watch it fill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll watch it fill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll start to change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go from clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll slowly turn to like a silverish
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll get cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see it, you'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now you're going, what does he mean
by cloudy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you got a fish bowl and then
you put some dish soap in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: stirred it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your cloudy tricombs are going
to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your next step after cloudy is milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they turn kind of bluish,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a hint of blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have that, if you stare at like
certain white paints and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll start to see a blue kind of
undertone a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, yeah, a nice patch of milky
tricombs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always see just a little hint of light
blue in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fish bowl I talked about a minute
ago, imagine if I took your fish bowl that
[SPEAKER_00]: had, we dumped out the dish soap because
this is just going to get gross if we keep
[SPEAKER_00]: adding stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you took a fish bowl that's got
water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you poured just enough milk in there
to make it turn light white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, it's not going to be fucking boom
like ice cream, but it's going to be light
[SPEAKER_00]: white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you poured some creamer in your
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just lighten it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that tricombs is what I would call
milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a milky tricombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're almost ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step that's going to happen is
going to look like you had a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I took like the little spray
bottle that you're spraying your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with or whatever that little Mr. bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I poured some Dr. Pepper in there
and I walked right up to your tricombs and
[SPEAKER_00]: just just give it a little spritz of Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tricombs are going to have a little
amber spritz on them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what I think it looks
like is like you sprayed some soda right
[SPEAKER_00]: onto your tricombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go from milky and then
you're going to see just a couple of them
[SPEAKER_00]: get this amber color, this Dr. Pepper
color right across them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see it happen toward
the top and kind of right in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: and then keep pay attention to the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you see that first bit of amber
really start paying attention because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a very short time now they're
going to start that amber is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start progressing throughout the plant
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the scope and you can
see you're going to have to look around
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant when 30 percent of those
tricombs start becoming amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you want to cut down 30
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say look in several places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be like 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know when I can see a hundred
tricombs in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look around and use your best
judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys about 25 to 35 percent is where
you want to aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to notice a difference if
you're a few days off on your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you are not going to notice a
huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a drying cure period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you cut down these plants,
those tricombs are going to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: change all the way until the moment you
combust them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got this dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get beat up and harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be so many different
changes in those tricombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a couple of days in your harvest
window will not make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to hurt your feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to those tricombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to turn silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to get cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it starts getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're filling up with tricombs or with
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they've got different things in there,
different psychoactive ingredients inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of there that are changing every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to get milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to turn a little bit blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to look like I sprayed
them with Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: When three out of 10, when 30% of them
have that Dr. Pepper stain on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when it's time to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to say, but it's my first
grow with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I plan that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I properly be able to flush and
look out for tricombs to be amber?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought of a great way that we can all
be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, this isn't going to be the
last time you're growing the strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time you grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you don't know when the
tricombs are going to change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you don't know how long it's
going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time you're developing a
relationship with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you got to learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second, third time you dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth and fifth time you perfect this
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just learning this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a 60 day plant,
if the package says grow it for 55 to 60
[SPEAKER_00]: days, go that 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go for 60 days,
flush it day 50 and really start paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to those tricombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to cut it down at a specific
day, just make sure you flushed seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to go 14, but seven to 10 days
should be plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to let your plant go 70 days,
if you've got something I bred,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably want to let it go 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I bred it 70 days, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start flushing at day 60 and pay attention
to your tricombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut down at day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 70, if you don't feel like it's ready,
let it go a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need nutrients to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to start getting tired,
but then you can give it time to ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the way to judge when to
harvest your cannabis is by paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the tricombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a way to look at the
tricombs, you don't have a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately judge the ripeness of your
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you run the risk of cutting them way
too early is what most people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they're done,
wait three to five more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can wait seven more days,
wait, because they're only going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't cut too early because you're
anxious and eager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut clones or you grew from seeds and
those took time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you vegged it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spent a lot of money on nutrients
you've already spent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to put 115 days into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not put 122?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you start getting itchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting that crack head lips and
you start scratching your neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah, I want to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of a friend of mine who was
always in that clip-in lower nut.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd start at the bottom of the plant and
start taking nugs and drying them out as
[SPEAKER_01]: fast as he could to keep himself covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time he got to harvest,
it was just like the top coal is left on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's nothing to enjoy because
you fast ride everything and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: have just had one huge harvest and
actually saw harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what it looks like,
what your work actually did instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just destroying your work slowly and not
getting any reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the main things that it's
hard to learn when you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just need to hide your
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send Mike home with the scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, bro, take these so that I can't
cut my plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on suicide watch or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take these, bro, so I can't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that was a pretty quick way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's right to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other way to explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some sort of magnification and look at
your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing for trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't care about all that leaky green
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the secret, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to get in there with some
magnification and spend some time reading
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not worried about all the green
leafy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that part tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the trichomes are the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure they're ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I should add, if you are
growing for concentrates, maybe cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start flushing early and harvest a little
bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you want nice and clear
concentrates, maybe this is some industry
[SPEAKER_00]: secrets I shouldn't be sharing with the
general public, but here you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you and this is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want nice and clear concentrates,
cut your plants down before the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start getting dark, what you're
extracting is trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your concentrates will come out a little
bit darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut them down when they're nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and clear concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of concentrate makers can make super
clear concentrates out of everything now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less work if you're pulling it down
when you have got nice and clear
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut early and process quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to tell you what week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes like, week seven-ish I've seen
it go for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little bit ridiculous,
but then you can pull a whole one more
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut everything down at the end of
week six, then you could feel one more
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest a year in your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's business, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Axel Rose said, all we need is just a
little patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I want to thank

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, weed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 388 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find them at www.dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that I start the
show off by just feeling like that is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has given me some ridiculous cotton
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you can almost hear it on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I have been having a
really busy couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out of town twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going back out of town Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a comedy show in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will be attending the Endo Expo in
Denver on Saturday and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am doing another repost for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode was determining ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we know when the plants are ripe,
it is time to begin flushing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that many new growers and many
experienced growers overlook the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of flushing our plants and it
is not happening properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this in the episode over
and over again, but flushing is free and
[SPEAKER_00]: it can improve the overall quality of your
finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why wouldn't we focus heavily on
flushing at the end of the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'm going to say that plenty of
times through this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's jump right
into an episode about flushing our ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 320 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed

[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you check out our friends
at PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at PLGrow.Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, first off,
let me apologize for my terrible sounding
[SPEAKER_00]: voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Brett, also known as Mary's
Motivation, had a going away party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to that going away party and I
smoked way too much flour and way too much
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my voice sounds like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of a chest cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a throat thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a sinus thing happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we get too far, I just want to
apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank you for listening to
this episode while I sound like poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start the episode off by
letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm taking little baby dabs of
Gorilla Glue 4 Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I've got some of the New York
City Diesel Ambrosia Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going light today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to stay lightly medicated and
not mess up my lungs and throat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the path to recovery and I want to
keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a minute ago, I mentioned that I went
to my friend Brett, also known as Mary's
[SPEAKER_00]: Motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Brett's going away party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett is leaving the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett's a little scared and nervous about
his trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I don't think anybody
deserves this more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett needs to make this adventure happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a great
experience for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am super proud and super excited for
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His party was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the party, we were joined by,
of course, the always awesome Brett was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab and Granny and and Kevin showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mama Bear Dabs was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to see Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to bump into my friend Twisty Seeds,
who I don't see very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to have a conversation, a long
conversation with Chandler Dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earl Tycoon was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude from Hits on Hand was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: LJ Fresh was there and several other new
and old friends were there hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of folks there who
brought Canna Gars, which are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: blunt, rolled with cannabis leaves as the
wrapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really fucked up my lungs,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs did not like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were delicious to smoke and we got
really lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is why I think I sound like crap
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Brett for the great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: The party was a private party,
so not a lot of people were invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event was at Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge shout out to everyone at
Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we do an event there,
every time we do a large or small party
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it goes very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place is very inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The staff is very accommodating and I
always have a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody who came to
the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra huge shout out to Brett for inviting
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was only able to invite 30 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to be amongst those 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great party, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked that place out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For how few people there were in there,
it was a pretty big building and we smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: that bitch out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear to my voice still All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I've still got some good voice left,
let's do a quick podcast about flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we talk about flushing,
I should do a quick recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I talked about
determining ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I went fairly fast and we got
kind of rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I made it clear that determining
ripeness is usually done by using some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a loop so that you can see the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned using a 60 or 100 X loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our friends from Instagram,
what's up, Dank Sinatra, our friend Dank
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinatra, sheer photo and seeds,
sent me a message and he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: now I can't see trichomes with my naked
eye, but I can tell ripeness of a trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: with a 16 X jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, of course, in my mind,
I'm in my mid twenties, so my eyes may
[SPEAKER_00]: work a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, dude, you are a little bit younger
than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got those fresh new eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he corrected me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he can see the trichomes with the
16 X jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not need that bigger loop,
that 60, that 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the 60 is working or the 16 is
working for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stand corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need that big loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 may get you through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's recap a little bit about what
I said about harvest times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that if you have a plant that is
said to go 60 days, let it go the full 60
[SPEAKER_00]: days and start flushing at day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that's supposed to
go 70 days, let it go the full 70 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: start flushing around day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may say, Rasta Jeff, I want to
dial it in and cut these plants down at
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfect ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're going to have to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I wanted to stress is this is
not your last grow with this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is your first run with
this cultivar, with this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a new girlfriend that
you've got to learn a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to take her out a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to see if she wants to come
down at day 60, day 63, maybe day 67,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe day 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to dial it in exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly to the right day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use different nutrients,
you may get different ripening days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a little bit of temperature
difference, you may get a different
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to find the window
and dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is not your last grow with
this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is the first of many grows
with a good cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's your first run with the 60 day
cut, start flushing around day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time with a cut that
you think may go 70 days, start flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: it around day 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you get to day 60 or day 70 on
whichever plant you're running,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to cut it down just because
you've been flushing for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start paying more attention to the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not amber, don't cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep flushing for a few more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to over flush than under
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you're doing is not giving
it nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have gotten a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have gotten a little beefier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're just trying to figure out the
plant for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how to determine when to begin
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know the cultivar that you're
using, maybe it's a brand new seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a new clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're just new at growing and you
don't know when to cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allowing the plant 60 to 70 days to grow
and then giving yourself extra time at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end is always your best bet with a new
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I have established how to
tell if the plant is ripe and ready to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we have a good idea of
when to start flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually talk about flushing our
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think flushing is super simple and it's
something people could easily improve and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really skipping that step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure why, because it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy step to improve your
cannabis and it is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people simply don't understand the
importance of flushing and why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you quickly why flushing
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine you've been pouring salty
nutrients into this plant for nine weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: of flour plus another three or four weeks
of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just been filling it up with
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring whatever nutrient
brand you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been pouring potassium and you've
been pouring carbohydrates into these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for the past 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of that stuff is built up inside
of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is not using all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's letting some of it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turning some of it into a gas and
transpiring some of it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of it is still in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those nutrients are left in the plant
when we harvest, dry and cure that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to taste like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed too much cow mag too late in
flour, you're going to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed your plants too much potassium
silicate late in flour, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plants are not going to burn
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dry and cure these buds,
they're not going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grind it up in a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to roll a joint and it's just
going to burn black and make a funky,
[SPEAKER_00]: weird charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because there are leftover
nutrients that you did not flush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get that stuff out of there by
properly flushing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were mostly flushing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to clean out the soil so there's
nothing left in your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's soil, soil-less mix,
if you got peat, whatever you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you're going to want to flush that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's rock wool, if it's cocoa,
you need to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each thing is going to take a different
amount of time to clean out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to clean that out so the
roots don't have anything to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plant will start starving itself
and it will start showing its harvest fall
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and it will taste proper when you
dry it, cure it, and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why flushing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get all those excess nutrients
out of there, all those excess salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you roll a joint and smoke it,
you don't want it to turn into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: briquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to turn into a nice,
white, fluffy ash and just flake away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from a properly flushed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that also comes from a properly
dried, cured, and trimmed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that comes in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're focusing on flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why flushing is important,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your herb to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to burn well, and you want it
to leave a nice, white, clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: soft ash with no weird chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually talk about flushing the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing the plants is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 to 14 days before you plan on
harvesting the plants, prepare the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of water that you would normally water the
garden with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 1,000 watt light,
maybe you've got a five gallon bucket full
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that amount of water ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you would normally put nutrients into
the water, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't put nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, if you're going to add anything,
put some enzymes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an enzyme, that will help
break down all the decaying roots and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the matter inside of the root zone,
and it will speed up the process of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help speed everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But enzymes are pretty much the only thing
I would put in there other than maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one to two grams of shine from veg
bloom, but you really don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly all you would need is some enzymes
for the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to flush for 14 days,
maybe go for four to seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: add two grams of shine and add some
enzymes, but then cut out the shine and
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep the enzymes going until the end
of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you would put in there are
enzymes and possibly some shine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you would be probably just fine with
nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean water, add the enzymes if you're
going to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: For four to seven days, add the shine if
you'd like to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, adjust the pH to somewhere between
6.3 and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be just fine, 6.3 and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good window to adjust it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, simply water the plants with that
minimal solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is pour that right
into the plants just like you normally do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak the plants and let it run through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what you're doing, pouring the
enzymes in there is going to help the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural decaying process happen inside
that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dead things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots that are dying are dying in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes are going to eat that,
and they're going to speed up that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that shine is going to keep adding
density and tricone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave the enzymes in there if
you'd like to at the end, but cut out that
[SPEAKER_00]: shine for the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're probably at day 50,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to cut down at day 60,
we're at day 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just mixed up a bunch of water,
and we just soaked that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got pHed water with enzymes
and possibly some shine running through
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are going to start looking
for phosphorus and potassium and
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum and all the other things that
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 16 minerals that the plants
really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys start thinking about that and
learn all 16 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will really help you think about what
you're feeding your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll talk about that in the future,
but the plant's going to start looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff, and all it's going to find are
enzymes and shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like, well, I've got
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go beef up my trichomes,
and it's got stuff to build trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't have the building blocks to
grow more plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have all the nutrition that it
needs to keep building bigger buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: fatter stems and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's going to start showing you its
fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start turning into these
yellow golden colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get some unique oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like taking pictures of my plants
right at the flush phase because they
[SPEAKER_00]: really start showing great colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are nice and fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are all greasy and shiny,
and then the leaves start getting these
[SPEAKER_00]: cool golden tones to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when you know that the flush is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no nutrients left in that soil
for the plant to eat, and it is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry, which is a good thing because now
you know that bud is going to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, molybdenum,
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, calcium, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have all this other
funky shit in it that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll burn nice and smoothly, and it will
taste really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're going to start seeing these
fall colors come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timing is going to depend on your
medium, how much nutrients you have been
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very strain-specific,
and also temperatures are going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge effect on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a little cooler in the room,
your plants are going to turn a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lower nighttime temperature,
you'll see a little more purple from the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a little more fall activity
from the plants, like would happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're going to mix up the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to water in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to run out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, depending on your container size and
the vapor pressure deficit in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to have to water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the enzymes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the shine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH adjust it to 6.3 to 6.5, and water it
right through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat this process right up to a week
before harvest, and then do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but simply take out the shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add the enzymes, adjust the pH,
and then feed it right through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the enzymes are totally not
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shine is totally not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do all of this with plain water if
you're adding the enzymes and shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have connoisseur quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do the shine up to the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, after that, I would just do the
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, I'd probably do just two or three
days of plain water just to give them time
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going that 60 days, I would end
up going 63, and that last three days
[SPEAKER_00]: would just be plain water and micro is
what would happen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just keep repeating the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse these plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse the soil out as many
times as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse the soil out as many
times as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse the soil out as many
times as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rinse the soil out as many
times as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't suffocate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be cutting down early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, don't ruin it right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay on your normal watering
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you soak the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that as many times as you can in the
last 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to add the enzymes,
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use shine, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the only things I would really
add at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have determined how to tell if the
plants are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have determined a good time to start
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to put in the water to flush
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know why we're flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically don't mix anything up and
you run that through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will clean out the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that's happening, we're going to see
colors changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see trichomes ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see plants finishing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're going to get a bunch of funky,
you may.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your genetics, your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get funky yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get dead foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem with just yanking that
dead stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of the grow room, but just pull
all that dead stuff off and throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, about a week, maybe five or three
days before you harvest, go in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room and just start stripping off all the
big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to save you a lot of time
when it does come time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be all these big giant leaves
in your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut them off while the plant is
standing up, while they're still stiff,
[SPEAKER_00]: while they're still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just snap them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need scissors for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the thumb technique of just
popping a leaf off, you can just go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and defoliate a whole section really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days before harvest, go in there and
pull off all those big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will save you a big headache and a
bunch of time when it comes time to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hang them upside down, dry them,
and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes time to trim, half the
leaves are already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will save you a lot of bullshit and a
lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them starting to get funky,
take off the dead ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, just a few days before harvest,
probably when you cut out the shine maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go in there and start pulling off the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing you might want to do is
you might want to reduce the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not create a large swing in temps
between your day and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not go too cold at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not try to create something drastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can bring it down two or three
degrees during the day and two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees during the night, do that,
but don't go crazy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't shock the plants right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give yourself powdery mildew right
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to mimic nature and get a little
bit colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what happens right at the end of
the season, it gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how things know, oh shit,
it's winter time and those plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: hurry up and finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you'll see more color, you may get a
little more density, and cool temps are
[SPEAKER_00]: good for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, lower the temperatures a little bit
right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I'm sure people are going
to send me messages about and ask is,
[SPEAKER_00]: do I use any flushing agents?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do not use a flushing agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of the flushing agents are
kind of a sales tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they make your herb taste like
whatever they taste like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I want to put in a new
ingredient?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I do not use a flushing agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to use anything, I would just
use the solution I told you, the enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: and the shine, and then I would add
powdered coconut water, would be the only
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing solution that I would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people are saying,
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, coconut water would be ideal,
but that would get very expensive to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: it, have that much coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine trying to get a five gallon bucket
of coconut water shipped to your house
[SPEAKER_00]: every three days for 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get real expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can buy powdered coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is readily available from a lot of grow
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build-A-Soil can take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not sponsor the show or anything,
but I know that that's a reliable source
[SPEAKER_00]: for powdered coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something I should mention,
a lot of people are growing no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are growing in living soil
or super soil or some sort of live soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if that is what you're working
with, you probably do not need to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have created the perfect
environment inside your plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere to where it's taking up what
it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not feeding it bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not being force-fed shit,
so it doesn't need to be flushed anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Subcool, when he would mix up a
batch of super soil and put a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, he would just beat it water for the
whole flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would say, I've been flushing the
entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, before people start sending me emails,
yes, there are some situations where you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not need to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going no-till, if you're going
all organic, flushing is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're running that, you're
already up to speed and you know that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to teach you about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in the advanced black belt class
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've got one more thing I should
mention before I wrap up this so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: quickie episode that's going on for 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good thing to do is to measure the EC or
the PPMs of your runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were pouring a bunch of water into
your plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect the water that comes out of the
bottom of your plant into some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your pH pen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your EC or PPM pen in there and see
what the EC is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in a soil or a soil-less
mix, you're only going to get down so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in cocoa, you can get those PPMs
down really, really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe before you start flushing,
that day, the first day you flush,
[SPEAKER_00]: measure what comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then measure each time and see how low you
can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just keep experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low it goes every day and see how
low you can get the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give any recommendations
on how low to try and get it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to vary based on your medium and I
don't want to fuck up your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn this based
on your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa, you'll get it really low because
cocoa is inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa is not going to hold shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with rock wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to get the PPMs of your
rock wool and your cocoa down to amazingly
[SPEAKER_00]: low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil, soil-less mixes, those are still
going to have some high PPMs because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are soil and soil-less.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But play with your runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how low you can get it and it'll be a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a fun experiment and then you'll
actually see what's going in and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should just talk about measuring
runoff anyway in a full episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about checking the EC or the
PPMs of a solution before you pour it into
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants and then we'll re-measure that
same solution, the EC or the PPMs when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of the bottom of your plants and
we'll compare that to the pH going in and
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see what's happening in your
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, measure the electrical
conductivity or the particles per million
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's coming out of your plant and you
will know if you need to flush more or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you cut it down,
write down the PPMs and then pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you are satisfied,
hit that number next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not satisfied, maybe flush a
little longer and try to go lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't be discouraged because it's not
all about the flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have dry and cure to fuck this
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could ruin your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank
you for listening to my flushing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we have done determining ripeness,
determining when to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next episode in line is
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, we're going to do the
dry and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some interruptions to that
schedule because I've got an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled with some friends and things
always pop up, but those are on the chart
[SPEAKER_00]: to come up in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for
listening to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me ramble for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you felt like this podcast was
educational and you learned something and
[SPEAKER_00]: you would like to contribute to the
podcast financially, I would truly
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the support and you can do so
by going to patreon.com slash grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart and all of the information that
you need to sign up will be right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really simple and I would appreciate
the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging for payments or
contributions or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do this podcast forever for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not trying to get rich off of
podcasting, but there are a few people who
[SPEAKER_00]: said they would like to contribute to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make sure there is an
opportunity for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will do with those funds is I will
pay for my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I host this podcast on my
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs a little bit of money to do that
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I purchased a better MacBook so that
I could record more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: My old computer was not efficient as the
polite way to say it, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: contributions will help to go pay for the
MacBook that I bought and also cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may have heard Mike mention that
the little microphone cover needed
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the funding for things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to contribute, I would
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will quit begging because that got
uncomfortable quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it if
you would stalk me on all of the social
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is click around.

[SPEAKER_00]: Simply search for the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find my personal account if you're
interested in trolling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Rasta Jeff 420 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you should check me out on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Iri underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do live feeds where I go on
Instagram live and I hang out and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take questions from the
Instagram live feed and I will rant about
[SPEAKER_00]: your question and teach you how to grow
cannabis right there on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fun because there's no notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today somebody asked me a fairly in-depth
question and I had to stare into the sky
[SPEAKER_00]: and roll my eyes for about two minutes and
try to word out the reply I was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them because I wasn't prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a lot of fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like it's like a game of
stump the grower or stump the breeder or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my brain going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my growth knowledge on the tip of
my tongue and it keeps my brain active.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that I had a brain injury a
few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to do things to keep my brain
going the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway I'm fucking ranting today you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who needs a quick episode right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would enjoy my Instagram live
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also why wouldn't you want to check out
some dope ass cannabis photography.

[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I think that's all I've got for
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a super rambly episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for hanging out
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for tolerating
my raspy crappy voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I talked it right out by the
end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally sound pretty decent now that the
show is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for tolerating that at the start
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I'll be back Monday with a fresh
new episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Texan Toker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That quality base here, the eagle has
landed.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys next time.
