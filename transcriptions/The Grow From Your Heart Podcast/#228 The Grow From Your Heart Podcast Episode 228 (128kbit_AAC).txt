professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you

[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am coming to you all by myself today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do an episode about ways to
improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to improve your garden is to use
organic soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get organic soil amendments?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your organic soil amendments
from the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic portion of this episode were
brought to you by my friends at the Rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in
Colorado Springs to get your fresh worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings, African nightcrawlers,
red wigglers, and all of your organic soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company has
Dragonfly Earth medicine products in stock
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company will ship
to your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the same worm castings and
many of the same amendments that I use in
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden through www
.rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you visit the store, it's at 411-TOI

podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends at the
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get much further, if you guys
are interested in sponsoring the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com and
I'll get you all that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to take a second now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn on that music and we're
going to read an iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take me a second to get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a couple of clicks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to search for it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't play the opening music and have
this up at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not a multitasker.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both coming from iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to leave the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise I'm just talking while I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ratings and reviews, we're going to scroll
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to turn on the music as soon
as I get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest review says from iTunes by Mr.
Minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was left on April 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left me a five-star rating and it says,
I found this podcast recently and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff is articulate, thoughtful,
considerate, and he has a deep knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: base that he shares selflessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a true gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love plugging in and kicking back while
listening to all the information and fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely appreciate you leaving a
comment and saying that you love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great that you noticed I am
sharing this selflessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of credit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a long time to learn this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm bettering the plant and
medical marijuana and recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana by teaching everybody to grow
better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing is what I'm trying to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, leave a comment on iTunes and I will
read that on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to leave a comment on
iTunes, you can go to Twitter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go to Facebook, you can email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of ways to get in touch
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast or search for Grow
From Your Heart on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to follow me on Instagram,
it's at iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a lot of social media stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about our main subject for
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about ways to
improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I opened my phone, I just saw the most
terrible tweet, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to be the bearer of bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the legend, I'm going to kill the
music here and say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making sure this is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's true, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell you this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already heard this because this
episode is going to come out in a week
[SPEAKER_00]: from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But BB King has passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blues legend, BB King is no longer with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take a really brief moment
of silence for BB King.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll tell you about my favorite
BB King performance I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take just a brief,
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do long moment of silence,
but this is for BB King.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was out of respect because BB King,
I'm a huge musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played music for my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a drummer longer than I have not
been a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got drums for my 15th birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all I cared about for probably
10, maybe 15, 20 years was the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all that mattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a daughter and that changed
some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to play in a band called the
Chromebenders with a guy named Brian
[SPEAKER_00]: Ritchie and Donovan McNeely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kenny Nicholson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were other guys that rotated in
and out of that band, but those were,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our bass player was Dennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't forget the bass guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several guys, Dennis Morgan,
by the way, there are several guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: rotated in and out of that band,
but Brian Ritchie and I were always in
[SPEAKER_00]: that band together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used to do the thrill is gone,
which is a BB King tune.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh man, we would play the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something, BB wrote amazing
songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about my favorite BB King
musical moment that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get to see BB King.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many shows that I chose to
go to that I had to skip some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of fish and Mo and
widespread panic and stuff along that
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, but I skipped all the BB King
chances and now I kind of regret it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him on the HBO 25th anniversary of
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the exact title,
but those words are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 25th anniversary, the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stevie Wonder's band performed and several
musicians came out and performed with
[SPEAKER_00]: Stevie Wonder's band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do like a montage and then they
bring out BB King and they did the thrill
[SPEAKER_00]: is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some moments in that song
when the hair on the back of my neck
[SPEAKER_00]: stands up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately guys, BB King is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to BB King.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody liked him on that guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to some BB feel some blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want to see that on the phone
there right during a show, but they gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me some content, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thrown off now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Death is never a comforting feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ways to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change the vibe of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ways to improve our crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one major way to improve your
crop and you guys are going to say you're
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you say that, but this is why
I'm a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reason, a way to improve your crop is to
use high quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a clone from somebody you trust that
has ran that clone and it's a clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know is going to do well so that
you're not wasting your time, wasting your
[SPEAKER_00]: space, wasting electricity, money,
nutrients, on a plant that isn't worth a
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good quality stream, good quality
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm going to recommend some IRE
genetics, some rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Gage Green genetics,
La Plata Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just a few of the brands that I
really trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just a few off the top of my
head that if I were going to grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, those are the guys I would grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage Green, La Plata Labs, they're friends
of mine and I trust their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: IRE genetics of course is my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some good trustworthy genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can go to Kindlove in Denver,
they quite often have great genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the Lemon Jeffrey available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll grow some amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ways to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, use quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part B to that is learn those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect to pull off an amazing
cannabis cup winning crop the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants want different shit at
different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to figure out what
the temperature and humidity is for that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to figure out how
long it takes to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop a relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got a relationship with that
plant, you can really start dialing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, the nutrients, the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use quality genetics and learn the
genetics you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, ways to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds like a no brainer guys,
but label everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe how many times I
thought I'll remember what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on in the future,
I don't know what the hell that clone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I'm trying to grow some random
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to wait and see what it looks like
when it flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smell it, figure out what the
hell it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label everything you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, this is number three,
but it's also kind of a part B of number
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're labeling shit, take a lot of
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes of when that clone was cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes of when that clone went into a
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes of when that clone went into a
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes of when that pot is up potted
into a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes of the day it went into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down every feeding that I mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write that shit down so that if I see
something amazing, I know what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't forget what I did last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make a lot of notes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you do any super cropping,
any tweaking of the plants, any topping,
[SPEAKER_00]: any pinching, if you use any bug sprays,
any shit like that, just write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when you have amazing results or
shitty results, you have a record to look
[SPEAKER_00]: back on, and you can look through the
notes and go, oh, look, dude, here is
[SPEAKER_00]: right where we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find it, you can identify it,
and you can correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So label everything thoroughly and take
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that sounds obvious to
me, but I've noticed a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: ignoring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work as a consultant, and people in my
neighborhood can call me and invite me to
[SPEAKER_00]: their house, and I do charge a small fee,
but I will come look at your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever it is, and I will give you a
little bit of advice or correct your
[SPEAKER_00]: issues or your problems and help you get
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I often see is people do not pay
any attention to the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are mixing up your nutrients or
your reservoir of clean water,
[SPEAKER_00]: before that goes into the water or into
your pots of plants, the pH needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using organics, ignore this
because you'll kill the organics by using
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organics will buffer themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll work themselves out, excuse me,
because I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm better now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using synthetic nutrients or
bottled nutrients, make sure you pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is super critical in hydro and really
important in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, pay attention to your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mix up your water, when you mix
up your nutrients, you want to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: final mix come out about 6.5 before you
pour it into your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your thing with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the desired nutrients in there at the
desired amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it with your PPM meter if you're
even using one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing to pay attention to,
your parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it with your PPM meter, then put
your pH meter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be a little bit
high still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get it down to about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need to add something,
probably a pH down product to that just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up again, put your pH meter in
there and do it until you're about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to hydro, you might want
to go 5.8, 5.5 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the hydro expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, so don't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am definitely learning hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely learning quickly on the hydro
because it's all we're doing at the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to your pH, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the problems in your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your leaves start doing stupid shit,
it's usually because of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's going to mimic other
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to try, you're going to
think, oh, I've got a CalMag deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: or, oh, I've got a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: When really the only problem is that your
pH of your feeding is off and your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants will react by showing you
problems and you'll try to create correct
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that don't even exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll probably create more
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys make sure the pH is correct of
your feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, something I should add to that,
I'm going to skip ahead a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is this note?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a lot of stuff, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I can really stress
right now since we're talking about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most grows will recommend RO water if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's reverse osmosis water, but that
does require kind of an expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're just doing a small home
grow, it's a little ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the big growers will definitely
recommend reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, at the spot dispensary where
I'm the grower there, we've got several
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand gallons of reverse osmosis water
being cleaned all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe the water tanks we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, I think there are four 1,000
tanks in the RO room and they stay full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pump that into separate rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each room's got four 250 gallon tanks in
it, which is where those dump into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using a lot of RO water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're unable to get RO water,
a good idea is to fill your reservoir and
[SPEAKER_00]: then put an air stone and air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't put the air pump in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys put the air stone in the water,
put a little tubing to the air pump,
[SPEAKER_00]: plug the air pump in, and that will
oxygenate your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that will do is it'll bring the
water that's at the bottom to the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll push the chlorine and whatever else
they're putting in our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it'll clean that out for you a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring it to the surface and the
chlorine has to make it to the surface to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting some oxygen in there will
definitely help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to do that for at least 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to get the chlorine out
before you mix any nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or especially if you're making an organic
tea, it's definitely a good idea to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble out that chlorine as long as you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've almost always got a big, it's the
brute trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a trash can on wheels and then
I've got a little area with a little setup
[SPEAKER_00]: of water net or a little bubbler set up
next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just fill that trash can up and then
I roll that over to this area and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: drop the air stones in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost always filled with bubbling
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can mix into that if I need to,
or I can make smaller portions in five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon buckets out of that if I need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to keep that clean water on
hand all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of skipped around on my notes,
but this is going to help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets me back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, have that water prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next note is plan ahead and have your
rooms ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And allow time for your plants to recover
from topping and training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's two things in one there,
but plan ahead to have your rooms ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have plants that are
vegging and they're going to start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: too tall and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be like, I really need
to flower these.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're going to wish that
you'd planned ahead and thought about this
[SPEAKER_00]: room is going to be done at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area will be done at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will need to go here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really try to plan ahead and think about
what you're going to do with each plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good time for me to tease and
let you know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to plan ahead and plan ahead
and plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go down a few nodes and cut out the
main center stock, you have just now
[SPEAKER_00]: basically topped your plant and you've
created multiple tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis wants one main top naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the small tops that were subtops
will now start creeping up and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: become new dominant tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's topping a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really explain it much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just grab the top, go from the top
cola and then just go down and then keep
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of look, like kind of if I cut it
here, how many branches are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: left?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it going to be kind of even?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can, don't be afraid to fuck
up a couple, but don't go fucking up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of top one and see what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut off a little bit at a time because you
can cut more, but you can't put shit back
[SPEAKER_00]: on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supercropping is kind of, I learned
supercropping from a guy named Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supercropping is when you kind of take the
stem of the plant and I rub it between my
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers to soften it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I pinch it a little to crack the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I honestly just push the branch
right over at a 90 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had one branch that was growing
taller than the rest of my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find a spot just a little bit
lower than the rest of the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just break that branch right
there and bend it over at a 90 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for about a day, it's going to look
like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to look like it might die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next morning when the lights come
on, you'll go in there and look and that
[SPEAKER_00]: branch will be perfectly horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be broken, bent at a 90 degree
angle, perfectly horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the end of it will start growing right
back up again toward the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've kind of straightened that
out so that you'll have a more level even
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also, where that branch was broken,
I think it'll be a little bit stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: than it ever was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit of what supercropping
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supercropping is also, I will grab the
main stock of the plant where it comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil and I'll put two fingers on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll put two fingers above there
and I will twist it and pop that branch
[SPEAKER_00]: until I hear a crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will move my hand, the hand
that was on the bottom, I'll put it right
[SPEAKER_00]: above the other hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm just grabbing up a little
higher and just crack again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll take my left hand and put it
right above my right hand and crack again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put the right hand above the left
and crack again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where I've cracked up this plant like
10 or 12 times right up the main stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this does, it'll make little
knuckles in there and those are,
[SPEAKER_00]: they toughen up that stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That main stock will get a little bit
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a thicker stock that's a
little bit stronger also can move more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and it can also support bigger
branches, which also can support bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can also do this to branches as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will grab the branch and just turn it
just a little bit and you'll hear crunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: crunch, crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just breaking that cellulose
wall in there so that it has to rebuild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're popping your
knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll freak you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to do it too frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to let the plant heal from it
once you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got time and space to veg
and you're trying to keep your plants fat
[SPEAKER_00]: and healthy, supercropping is a really
cool way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also talk a little bit about
scrogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about scrogging when we had
Spence on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all mostly canopy management
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this with Spencer,
but I'm going to go over it again with you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrogging is when you use the screen or
the net and you let your plants grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you kind of put the screen on them
and push them down and then they just
[SPEAKER_00]: flatten out and then they start growing
through the screen a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you try to get one cola through each
part of the screen and then you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, even canopy because our goal is to
have an even canopy instead of one big
[SPEAKER_00]: cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a bunch of small colas that get
even light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just helps out for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those big buds aren't extra valuable
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually kind of a pain in the ass
for the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about supercropping,
topping, scrogging, tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to use a tomato cage,
you guys, because in a seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those, I think it's an 18 inch
around tomato cage, it's a nice top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get, if you top the plant
twice, you get about eight good heads off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant and you got just enough space
around that tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the cage to support the buds
and you can also use the cage to pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds apart to get more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spread those branches apart,
you get more light to each bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to use that square footage of your
light space a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put the tomato cage on early and then
I let it veg with the cage on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I start pulling it out and
strapping it up to the edge of the cage
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make room in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can use the cage to keep it
supported, or you can tie it into the cage
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it up, or you can tie it outside
of the cage to keep it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cage just really gives you a lot of
opportunity and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very versatile too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've talked about using bamboo
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I'll just get some bamboo
sticks in there, shove those right into
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt, tie the branches up to there,
pull them apart a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are good ways to get more light to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So topping, supercropping, scrogging,
tomato cages, and just using regular
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks are good ways to pull the branches
apart, get a little more canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: management, get more light down to the
middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I think pulling the big buds
apart gives you a little more airspace and
[SPEAKER_00]: they really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: LST is low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the Scrog method also with
a little bit of supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to just kind of bend and twist
the plants a little bit to keep them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shape you want and keep them low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trick here is to make the plants low
and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can fill space and not use a
lot of plants because in the medical game,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Colorado in the rec game,
you're allowed to have six plants and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care how big they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow six fucking house size
plants if you know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of cropping,
supercropping, LST kind of stuff will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely do it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of gone over the canopy
management stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really quick on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another part that I can talk about and
we're going to wrap this episode up pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed you guys like the 30 minute
episodes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should really talk about is
pay attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many problems are from the room or the
environment that you've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of the day and nighttime
temperatures and the humidity through veg
[SPEAKER_00]: and bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too low of humidity and veg will stunt the
growth of your plants and it'll lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of mimics a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's not enough humidity,
the plants will mimic problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you'll be trying to correct
something and really all you need to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So too low humidity will stunt the plants,
lead to deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much humidity will lead to mildew
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also slow the growth of your
plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for veg, try to stay around 50% or
above and max out around 75% humidity in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go a little higher, but that's
when you start running the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep it consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the veg stage, try to keep temps
around 74 to 77 degrees during the day
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere from 77 or 72 to 82 is okay for
most strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've noticed is 74 to 77 degrees
during the day is prime in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my plants in veg, 74 to 77 degrees,
they go nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, this is just the room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not leaf surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf surface temperature is a whole other
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the night cycle, try to get around
68 to 75 degrees, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll sum that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your veg, you want your temps 70 to 80
degrees for the day, 68 to 75 at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 50 to 75% humidity during the veg
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to interrupt myself and talk
about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk in your grow room,
if you can smell dirt and soil and pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: moist air and funk, you need more
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more air coming in and more air
going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't smell like a pot garden in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little bit humid and a
little bit sticky, but if you can smell
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot garden in your pot garden,
that means your neighbors can smell the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot garden down the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can walk in there and it smells
like pot and it smells like soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to get more carbon filters and
pull more air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need to get more HIPAA
filters and pull more air in, because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting stagnant, stale air in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not smell like an old funky
basement in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should smell clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: random way to improve your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the bloom phase, it is ideal to
have temps hovering between 74 to 77
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees during the day and 66 to 75
degrees at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting temps too high will slow the
plants down again, and too low will
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage mold and rot, like I've said.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a strain that has purple
characteristics, what you can do is you
[SPEAKER_00]: can lower the temps a little bit around
week six or seven flower, and that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely start bringing out the purple
color in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough about humidity and
temperatures in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys understand that,
but those basic things will definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more quick tips before I wrap it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray some shit on your plants in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are in flower, please do
not spray them with any type of bug spray
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to hit them with a foliar
spray, be really careful and really
[SPEAKER_00]: selective what you spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime after week three, really,
that stuff is going to end up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, from the beginning of flower,
there's not time for systemic chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of your buds or off of your buds,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're spraying something like
fulvic acid and some sea kelp or something
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to increase things, that's not a
bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful when you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray bug sprays at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray pesticides at all during
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only spray healthy, helpful foliar sprays
and stop those around week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please, please, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something that I stress a lot to
improve your cannabis, flush your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is involved in planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about planning your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan 14 days to flush your crop before you
cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, I'm going to tell you
another way to improve your crop is to
[SPEAKER_00]: cure your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to the episode about drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll really, really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry and cure your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush it, dry it, and cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that may help you out,
guys, don't bring more people to your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people you bring in is where your
bugs come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also here's another quick hint that's
just coming out randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get a clone from somebody,
quarantine that bitch, hit it with some
[SPEAKER_00]: bug spray, check it for a couple of days
and make sure there are no bugs on it
[SPEAKER_00]: before you introduce it to the general
population of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: One bug, one russet mite coming into your
garden, one russet mite into a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower's garden could devastate
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your crop that is four weeks into flower
could be decimated before you could save
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mother plants will be eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your veg plants will be eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have taken russet mites to all your
buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get a clone, quarantine that
bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring friends over to your grow to
show them because they're bringing powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, spider mites, root aphids,
fucking white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all traveling on your buddy's
clothes with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, be careful in each other's
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another tip about your garden to make it
better, just don't tell people about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you want to show off your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to show off those big old buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make an anonymous Instagram account,
post the pictures to Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: tag your friends or something in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't make it all braggy to where
everybody knows who you are and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing because word travels really,
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I post pictures of my shit and I
talk all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow for a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different story, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of the blue now, or I'm out of the
woodwork now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of the shadows.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've done about 30 minutes
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look and see how far we're into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, 29 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting good at podcasting you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time to wrap up this show
before my throat goes bananas,
[SPEAKER_00]: before my ADD kicks in, before your ADD
kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we didn't do a dab on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move the iPhone out of the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grab a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a dab together, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to dab some Black Cherry Kim
that was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I bred this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was I involved in this extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this one was not extracted by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done by my good friends at the
Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the hash I've had my hands in
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make myself some pretty decent BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you guys to take a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're dabbing, get a big fat
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do like a 0.3 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't kill yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go a little bigger,
a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, now it's troublesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that limit with the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, go a little bigger,
go a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit, that's too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to grab the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Giddy up in Emotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Hitman Dougie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a dab off the Hitman
E-Series Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the highly educated titanium nail
hooked up to the Emotech G-nail from Giddy
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all of those people for
making my dabs amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, four, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Card capping and freestyle rapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3 and no cough because I'm a boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some Platinum OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like dabs a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next episode, you guys, is going to
be... The next episode will probably just
[SPEAKER_00]: be rambles and news because I'm still
writing that perpetual grow episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's boggling my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stuck, but I'm going to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a couple of people throw
some ideas at me and I figured out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back in a few days.

[SPEAKER_06]: The thrill is gone, babe.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thrill is gone away from me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'll still live on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so lonely.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 72 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver, if you're a new smoker or a
veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: activist, or even someone who's just
curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table from me is my
good buddy, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn this music down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that real loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to yell over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a dab and my lungs are doing
that fluttery thing they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the intro too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got definitely warmed up before we
started recording today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just took some monster dabs of some,
that was Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracted by my good friends, my great
friends, my champion friends over at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some dedicated dabbers at the
Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stayed up and stayed in line outside
of Illusions Glass Galleries in Boulder
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight to scoop a new mothership rig
and they got one and it is sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at photos today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some dedication right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may say that that mothership rig is
a bit excessive, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys deserve that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck anybody that hates on you for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They worked for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They earned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invite me over for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow, we'll go take some dabs over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming, Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matty, make some cheesecake, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to send a big shout out to Kat and
Coot from the Mystic Roots band before we
[SPEAKER_00]: go too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots crew
let me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should cost me a lot of money to play
music on a podcast if you do things
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, but they let me have access to
their full library.
[SPEAKER_00]: They emailed me everything, all the
instrumental tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of cool of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to burp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to get that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to force it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic portions of this podcast are
brought to you by my great friends at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company.

[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they still have the
Dragonfly Earth medicine products in stock
[SPEAKER_00]: by the time you listen to this,
but they have for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been selling them like a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them before they run out.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take you with me next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take Mike with next time and he can
stick his hands in the worm farm and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what goes on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the sponsor.

[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to leave some comments on
Facebook, Twitter, Stitcher, iTunes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff, I'd really appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to the heart of the matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I got to say a couple more
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, I forgot that I've got a whole
nother pile of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get to the beef of the show
because we've got some shit that pissed me
[SPEAKER_00]: off when I read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to have Mike come over and kind of
interpret.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a week full of some horse shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the good part of the week on Monday,
my good buddy Clint, shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: My car has been broke down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint called me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, hey, dude, I know you're stuck
in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the 420 Speakeasy in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do some comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he picked me up and he took me up
to Springs and the 420 Speakeasy is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: damn cool, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost me 10 bucks to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They checked my ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I walked in, there's a dab bar
that you don't buy dabs, you buy credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can trade your credits for
dabs or flowers that you consume on site,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can trade your credits for Mountain
Dew or orange juice, or they had ice
[SPEAKER_00]: creams.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a credit system, which we know
what's going on there, but good way around
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was welcome to pull out my own rig and
my own dabs because I'm kind of a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: snob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really want to- Most of those
places are BYO everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I- Or red glass, but bring your own
everything to put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did have sweet rigs for rent,
but of course I show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the Eric Ross 4.0 custom rig,
so I had no need for any other rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought my own Earl with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sat at a booth and just dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dustin, Drew, Clint, and myself sat there
and dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint didn't take any dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of a puss, but he smoked weed
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had something to do that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he did a set of comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint had a life-changing event that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the comedy really let that event
come out on stage and that was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Ben Verbeck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hosts, it's called Comedy Anarchy at
the 420 Speakeasy on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it starts at eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys want some comedy,
you want to go smoke some weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to take some dabs, check that
place out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't up your Monday people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out on a Monday, go see some funny,
go support my friend Clint, go support
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy and Ben Verbeck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun because you could dab and see
comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me or anything to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a good time, wanted to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool having a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went home and I was with a few of my
bros and I was meeting new bros,
[SPEAKER_00]: just taking dabs and kicking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was open mic comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was moments of free
entertainment, moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to the 420 Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, somebody sent me an email asking me,
they want to add another light to their
[SPEAKER_00]: room and they wanted to know what the best
type of light would be in their situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the light I would recommend
would be a Gavita for almost any situation
[SPEAKER_00]: other than like a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a room and you're trying to
put new lights in there, go Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The double-ended bulb technology will push
your plants to another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that answers your question
there, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: I emailed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you respond to the email also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to brag about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast on Stitcher, we have reached a
peak rank of 748th out of 40,000 shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way to go, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of listens, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectacular, especially through Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Stitcher alone on Mondays,
you guys are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You download the show, 5,000 downloads on
Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody that downloads
it on Stitcher, iTunes and the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved up in the ranks on Stitcher quite
dramatically in the health and lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were ranked number 59 this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is because of me being a
guest speaker on the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: radio show about a week ago with LS Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely plugged my show heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to send a huge, huge shout out
to LS Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't already listen to it,
make sure you go listen to Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Radio with LS Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not found it on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to help him get his show
on iTunes because that's what he really
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just teach them about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to LS Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 people just on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for the love everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means another 5,000 on iTunes and
probably another half of that on my
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting- Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded straight off the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just got it on my phone to play
whatever when I'm rolling, but straight
[SPEAKER_01]: up- Stitcher shows me on Mondays that
5,000 people listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All 5,000 of you that listen on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that listens through the week,
thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're driving to work and I hope I'm
making your garden time, your work time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're stuck in a cubicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're stuck in that cubicle,
you know who I'm talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm making your day better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a supporter of a company called
Grassroots California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make these stylish hats that I wear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make some pretty cool clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make- I'm a fan as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company Grassroots has a store in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get you a Grassroots hat,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this beauty off my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been wearing a beanie since I met him
through the summer, through the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: for like seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Ashley, hell of a beanie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been promised she's going to visit
here sometime in the next year and make me
[SPEAKER_01]: a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're never going to get you a hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me pick another color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be a beanie forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks good on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to change you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the guys at Grassroots, shout out to
Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the owner and founder of Grassroots
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a hat company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They support the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They host the 710 Cup, which is a dab
festival where it's a dab competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they opened a business called The
Break Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What The Break Room was, was a smoking
lounge that you could bring your own- they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't sell anything there, but you had to
bring your own hat, your own flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could hang out in this building
and socialize and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had games and activities to do to
keep you entertained and snacks,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on 420, the Denver police raided The
Break Room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't the only ones raided,
but they were among those raided on 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a huge sweep on 420,
which come on, cops, it's a dick move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our break solve rate is still at like 40%
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're raiding speakeasies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go in and they raid The Break Room
and they shut the place down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in turn, they shut down the Grassroots
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Grassroots store is a separate
business and a separate- the store is
[SPEAKER_00]: divided.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a separate staff, a separate cash
register, a separate entrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, since it's Ryan's store
and everything, they shut down both
[SPEAKER_00]: buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they are forcing- the city of
Denver is kind of strong arm forcing the
[SPEAKER_00]: owner of the building to evict Ryan from
their prime location on Larimer,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they've never had a problem.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got such good sales there because
of their location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never done anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this dude that has put his life
into this company to make these sweet hats
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wear, and that you guys probably
wear if you're part of the movement and
[SPEAKER_00]: you listen to the show, I'm sure one out
of 10 of you guys has got a Grassroots hat
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be forced to move out of
that building and find another building,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to be hard because
everybody already knows- This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they know who he's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want him there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say, no, because you're
going to open another pot business and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to break the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, he's got a GoFundMe and all
kinds of crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to beg for Ryan,
but support Ryan any way that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to your council people in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to the Denver city attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you think it's
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your opinion does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they hear it enough, it might make
a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time we're asking you to
get involved tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be the last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike definitely needs you to get off the
couch and help us do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not just me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every cannabis consumer needs every other
cannabis consumer to stand the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We slept a little bit on some voting and
it looks like we got fucked by sleeping
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm going to read you some shit in
just a minute that you're going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait, that happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of fugly headed up later in
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into those news articles that
we've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick small drink of
this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a drink and then we'll get into
some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chug it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nice and hydrated now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for this news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so many things on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a big week in Colorado news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's from the Westward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is medical marijuana
crackdown bill now law.
[SPEAKER_00]: More about money than safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the article is by Michael Roberts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, governor John Hickenlooper signed
Senate bill 15-014, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized as a medical pot crackdown
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among other things, the legislation will
empower a board in consultation with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado department of public health and
environment to establish guidelines for
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians making medical marijuana
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The provision is backed by those like
Aguilar who doubt that most medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card holders receiving
recommendations for treatment of severe
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, a group that makes up approximately
93% of the total actually suffer from this
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll take a minute to pitch about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the 93% of Colorado medical
marijuana card holders list chronic and
[SPEAKER_01]: severe pain as one of their qualifying
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add all of the qualifying
conditions up, you get way more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because a lot of people list that
along with cancer, AIDS, MS.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's countless other ailments on the
list of qualifying conditions that cause
[SPEAKER_01]: severe pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so pretty much everyone with a medical
marijuana card in Colorado also includes
[SPEAKER_01]: severe pain when they're signing up with
their doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the legislature has done and the
theory, I guess, for several years has
[SPEAKER_01]: been that that 97% number is the fakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when, I don't know, when people,
I suppose, park in outside dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: across the street and watch people come
and go every day, there were all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: people claiming they did this regularly
right after we legalized and right after
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell what's wrong with me by the
way I walk from my car to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see my nerve damage from 20
yards away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even need to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have plenty of medical conditions we
could talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pain is one of them, but I shouldn't
even have to say what's wrong with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a medical marijuana card and it's
really not that detective or that nosy
[SPEAKER_00]: person's business what my problem is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these people have decided that that 97%
number is probably all of the fakers in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, which is like 97,000 people,
because there's roughly a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: people on the register.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're assuming roughly 97,000 people
are basically faking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this bill is a big attempt to push as
many of them as they can back into the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rec market where we're paying 20% more
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get into the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're going to blow this guy's
whole paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy wrote an article and you just
shot it all down for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, you just buried the lead for
this guy that took time onto this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says, but is this new rule more
about safety or money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though a 15-01-4 is now law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The debate continues to rage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest profile backer of the bill was
Senator Irene Aguilar, whose website lists
[SPEAKER_00]: her as Senator Irene Aguilar MD and
stresses her own medical background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Mike was getting at is they're
trying to make it harder for you to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana card for your pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we suspect that it's to drive you to
the recreational dispensaries where taxes
[SPEAKER_00]: are higher and you've got to spend more
money and pay more taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state makes more money because a
lot of the things that we see going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: this bill are all about the taxes and the
money and fuck the patients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a long bill and it does
several things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you take a look at it as a
whole, all of the things it does are
[SPEAKER_01]: designed to push people off of the medical
registry and into the rec market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next paragraph in this article just is
an excerpt from this lady's website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it brags and says,
I'm too cool for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talks about all the places she went to
school and her qualifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's an excerpt from another
article he wrote in March that says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies show that as many as 100 million
Americans suffer from chronic pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it affects more people than diabetes,
coronary heart disease and cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the American Academy of Pain
Medicine, 20% of all American adults
[SPEAKER_00]: experience chronic pain severe enough to
disrupt their sleep at least two times per
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of patients on the Colorado
Medical Marijuana Registry who claim
[SPEAKER_00]: severe pain is around 105,500 people,
just below 2% of the total population of
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that 1.9% of the state's
residents experience chronic pain and have
[SPEAKER_00]: turned to cannabis to help is hardly
surprising or shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Breeds also notes, excuse me,
Breeds also notes that the assorted
[SPEAKER_00]: lawmakers in favor of the proposal have
made it clear that the measure is a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve some medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, I read that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to move some medical marijuana
patients into recreational pot sales,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are taxed at higher rates than
medical pot sales in order to generate
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable tax revenue for state and local
governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between the amount of tax
revenue generated by the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana versus medical cannabis are
stark, as we pointed out last week in a
[SPEAKER_00]: post about rec pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we talked about how much the
taxes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they show a graph here that shows
state of Colorado medical marijuana sales
[SPEAKER_00]: tax for the month of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it shows, this is medical in
Adams County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, let's find Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did 14,000 $904 in the month of
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go down to look at the same
thing, Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The additional 10% sales tax brought in
$135,215.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they just want to move you right
over to that rec market so that you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend that extra $135,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dick move.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were working on this three years ago
and then they sort of dropped it last
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hype was that a whole bunch of
people were going to join the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana registry to avoid the taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that didn't happen, they brought
up the severe pain number again and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, let's push more of those people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the data collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they saw that the medical marijuana
market consumed like 65 or 70% of the $700
[SPEAKER_01]: million worth of marijuana sold in
Colorado last year, they kind of freaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they don't get is that rec consumers
consume occasionally, recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical consumers consume daily for
medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we're consuming the majority of
the meds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this was designed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep going back to this part,
but we'd put cannabis on the legal market
[SPEAKER_00]: here for medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the model started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's who we have screwed over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who's getting pushed right out of
all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting attacked from every angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state's taking money out of the
registry that they're not supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: access and spending it on stuff they're
not supposed to spend it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking to make it harder to get a
extended plant count, to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation for severe pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking to limit that with
caregivers in a half dozen different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to talk about in a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting tough to be a medical patient
in Colorado if you don't really keep up on
[SPEAKER_01]: your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be especially harder to
be a caregiver here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another article on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to the one that we just
read, but it goes on a different direction
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the same law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just such a big law.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several different news articles on
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to read part of the
new bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have the PDF on my screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll read part of that bill in just a
minute too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the headline alone will be enough to
make you understand why we're so
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll read some parts from that bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, this article is actually
written by Kristen Wyatt and I found it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mike sent me a link to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I called you to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is Colorado medical pot,
new caregiver limits, MMJ in schools,
[SPEAKER_00]: okayed by government.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Colorado's governor signed into
law, a crackdown on medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tongue twister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole new, we should just make
that something right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start over though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's governor signed into law,
a crackdown on medical marijuana Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of two measures designed to ferret out
people and properly using and selling
[SPEAKER_00]: untaxed marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we need an Oxford comma in
this sentence right here after the word
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would fix this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the wrong guy to ask that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it says, the law limits
caregivers, those who grow pot on behalf
[SPEAKER_00]: of patients to 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The change means that some high volume
caregivers will face the same oversight as
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial growers, paying licensing fees
and undergoing background checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new rule in Senate bill 14 have
support from the recreational pot
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, which has complained that the
light regulation on Colorado's caregivers
[SPEAKER_00]: has invited black market growers who don't
face residency requirements, background
[SPEAKER_00]: checks or commercial seed to sale tracking
used to ensure pot plants are grown and
[SPEAKER_00]: sold legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those people just have to grow
cannabis either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're going to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black market production people just do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're moving here to Colorado,
it's to hide amongst the many,
[SPEAKER_01]: like those idiots doing those warehouses
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they stood out like a sore thumb
because they weren't operating legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was clear to everyone around them
that they were about to get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were quickly busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things I want to rant
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the one thing that they did that
was cool was they left it at 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more than that, you're doing
something weird anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fees and background checks,
we would open our own dispensary if we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted background checks and fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're just a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just low key growing a little bit of
cannabis for somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, dispensaries make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caregivers can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the beauty of the caregiver
system is there's a huge number of people
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado that can't afford to be
spending four or $500 a week on medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without caregivers, I don't know a lot
of people that could manage their pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost savings when you go through a
caregiver is significant over trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: shop and even the medical dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting rid of the caregivers pushes
more people into the medical legal system
[SPEAKER_01]: of the shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, I hate this bill so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say, we're really
trying to make sure that caregivers are
[SPEAKER_00]: part of our regulatory system,
said representative Jonathan Singer from
[SPEAKER_00]: Longmont, who sponsored the bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caregivers have successfully resisted such
limits for years, but the law includes
[SPEAKER_00]: some concessions that won their
acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the law eliminates an
unenforced requirement that parents of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patients under 18 grow the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that now back in the day,
if you were under 18 and you were a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, your parents had to grow for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't assign a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't shop at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that kind of changes the rules there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rule had... There's two not horrible
parts of this bill, or you could even call
[SPEAKER_01]: them decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule puts some parents who moved to
Colorado seeking cannabis treatments for
[SPEAKER_00]: their children outside the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now those folks will be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also sets up a task force to start work
on public access to the state's few
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the marijuana industry has generally
opposed public access to the labs fearing
[SPEAKER_00]: backlogs, but... That's some horse shit,
ain't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let that sentence sink in for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is fighting letting
caregivers access testing labs because it
[SPEAKER_01]: might take them an extra day to get their
test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't the labs standing up asking for
more business?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my medicine needs to be tested just as
badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the dispensaries does, or whoever else
is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dumb rule came down what?
[SPEAKER_01]: After one batch of tests you got in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one or two good batches of testing
in before they shut that down so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't do it anymore.
Yep.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much stuff in this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I might skip a couple of
paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, this one is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law allows school districts to
consider allowing medical marijuana use on
[SPEAKER_00]: campus as long as the pot is administered
by a parent or designated medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana professional, not a school
nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pot and school's allowance would be
the nation's first, though it's not clear
[SPEAKER_00]: how many school districts would
participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nor would it allow any sort of smoked
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's capsules, oils, tinctures,
lotions only.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, it's a huge step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because a kid that's got ADD or
whatever else that requires a medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: that day- There are hundreds of kids that
have moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the nurse and get their pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying if you take a pill,
if you take a prescription, you go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: school nurse after lunch and she gives you
your pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't you just go in there and get
your ganja cookie, your sweet stone candy
[SPEAKER_00]: bear or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just skirting federal law again
and being silly, but it's a step in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right direction, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very tiny possible step in the
right direction, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small steps, baby steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, Governor Hickenlooper
said the law was a compromise worked out
[SPEAKER_00]: by both political parties and the pot
industry and caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The news went apeshit with this particular
amendment the last couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: pot and schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anti-pot people had a big hit with it
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was the budtender and I was the
manager at the very first dispensary in
[SPEAKER_00]: this little town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still surprised they're going to let
the kids use their edibles or whatever in
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've literally had hundreds of kids move
to Colorado to access this as a medication
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of them have to go to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of the things that we need
to find a good way to work around for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty good reflection of what the
community wants, Hickenlooper said.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the law doesn't require caregivers to
register their growing operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead it encourages them to register by
assuring them that authorities could
[SPEAKER_00]: verify their number of plants without
starting a criminal investigation instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of forcing caregivers to prove in court
that their operation is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of makes sense, but it also
seems... Haven't we seen this move before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all of you folk of a certain type
need to register so that we know where all
[SPEAKER_00]: of you are that when we want to round all
of those certain folk up, we know where
[SPEAKER_00]: they are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really backwards provision where
they're saying to keep from looking
[SPEAKER_01]: guilty, stand up and prove you're innocent
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any caregiver who's operating legally
answers the cop at the door with a binder
[SPEAKER_01]: full of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the cop can add, there's no
difficult questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're lucky because of where we live.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops will come and they'll say,
you grow wheat here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go, yeah, I got a couple of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll go, you got a medical card?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, okay, I've got so much other
shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stab anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for people in other towns,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you've got, if you're in like a
nice residential area and you stank it
[SPEAKER_00]: out, maybe it'd be a good idea just to go
register, just to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that this bill has been passed,
it would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they require it if you're doing more
than six plant minimums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to have to read this
bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a caregiver, you need to hop
online and download the PDF of this bill
[SPEAKER_01]: and read every word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be intimidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a little pen and paper,
make some bullet points of what you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: to do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Hickenlooper signed the measure at a
Denver police station to show goodwill
[SPEAKER_00]: between law enforcement and caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The language in the law came after years
of testing negotiations between medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana groups and police.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are good reasons for all sides to
not trust each other, said Terry Robnett,
[SPEAKER_00]: head of the Cannabis Patients Alliance who
helped negotiate the language.
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor has yet to sign the other
medical marijuana law that measures,
[SPEAKER_00]: that measure updates marijuana regulations
that were written before Colorado made pot
[SPEAKER_00]: legal for adults in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of stuff going on in this
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were saying, you guys,
I'm going to find the bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it on my, I've got the PDF here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things that really
got Mike's attention and my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off and it says, a bill for an
act.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is concerning marijuana
issues that are not regulated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: department of revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're basically, they're starting off
by saying, money, this is shit that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting money from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's money swimming by that we're not
catching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it sounds like they're saying
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the people we can monitor and
overtax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are the ways we found it to
rectify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part is marijuana revenue.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bill requires the Colorado medical
board to adopt rules regarding guidelines
[SPEAKER_00]: for physicians who make medical marijuana
recommendations for patients suffering
[SPEAKER_00]: from severe pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to find a new way to figure out
if you really hurt or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they've decided that your doctor isn't
qualified to believe you and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: qualified to tell your doctor what hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're going to come up with a
little sheet or some paperwork so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor can verify that you really do hurt
and you can verify that your doctor is
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's asinine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it hurts if it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the bill requires Colorado medical
board to adopt rules regarding guidelines
[SPEAKER_00]: for...
[SPEAKER_00]: No, wait, I already read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires the state agency to adopt
rules regarding guidelines for primary
[SPEAKER_00]: caregivers to give informed consent to
patients that the product they cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: or produce may contain contaminants and
that the levels of THC are not verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey Mike, as your caregiver,
did you hear all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tested any of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the warning label on my last
pickup says.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am giving you informed consent to my
patient that the product I have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: or produced may contain contaminants and
that the THC levels are not verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put any contaminants on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that because I watched the state
take away your right to verify your THC
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got it back now with this bill at
least.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to put together a group of
people to decide how and if you get
[SPEAKER_01]: access.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we let him play?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big if.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bill requires all primary
caregivers to register with the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the state health agency and the state
medical marijuana licensing authority,
[SPEAKER_00]: any primary caregiver who is not
registered shall register within 10 days
[SPEAKER_00]: of being informed of the duty to register.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a person fails to register after such
10 days, the state health agency and
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing authority shall prohibit the
person from ever registering and acting as
[SPEAKER_00]: a primary caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have a stick to whack at you
with some of their other rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now if they catch you as an
unregistered caregiver, they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: give you 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't register in 10 days,
you can't ever carry it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even tell me how or where to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill you have to require with the
state health agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the MED website, you can
download the voluntary registry form that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've had up there for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that they've put a new form
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this is signed into action,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This got signed Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all caregivers, you guys have 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
we'll all be fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll know the 10 day time limit is like
if a cop comes to your door and goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you a caregiver?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, are you registered?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got 10 days.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if the MED decides to mail all you guys
letters saying, you know, this is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be received on the 1st or whatever,
then you've got 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could fully pull that too and call
that notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill requires the licensing authority
and the state health agency to share a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum amount of information necessary to
ensure that a medical marijuana patient
[SPEAKER_00]: has only one caregiver and is not using a
primary caregiver and a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I'm a caregiver and I take good
care of my patients, you guys get love and
[SPEAKER_00]: any caregiver should be hooking up their
patients a little bit, giving them some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, take care of them, make sure
they're not hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they come over and like my back hurts,
you get out a fat dab of CBD and you fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that caregiver or that patient
should not be going to another caregiver
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting love from two people and
spoiling the whole game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or signed up with multiple people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of shop hoppers when
shops were still able to do sign with us
[SPEAKER_01]: and get blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just go from shop to shop and sign
up with Aidan a day.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get all kinds of free shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each shop would be under the
assumption that they were growing your
[SPEAKER_01]: six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it led to some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then here's another fund bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this bill permits monies in the
marijuana tax fund to be used to fund the
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation of any bills approved by
the marijuana revenues interim committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the marijuana tax money,
they want to, now they will be able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: that to implement all of the bills
approved by the committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later in the bill, they dole out a couple
of hundred grand random stuff that was
[SPEAKER_01]: never approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fugly from here on out folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for the downer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want to read?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of things in this,
which one do you want to hit on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple of bullet points on
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're limited to 36 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's five plants or five patients,
six plants per patient plus your own six,
[SPEAKER_01]: 36.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you special register all of your
extended plant count cards, which in which
[SPEAKER_01]: case you can grow up to 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 99 plants, you have to become a
licensed marijuana business, which
[SPEAKER_01]: requires buying a building and business
permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep it under 99 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a Colorado medical marijuana
patient, a Colorado recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, if you're listening to the show,
this bill applies to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever thought of growing plants,
this is something you need to read right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're far away and wondering what any
of this has to do with you, this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens when the community doesn't stand
up and speak for itself is he gets
[SPEAKER_01]: railroaded and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I said at the beginning of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know that this shit was
coming up to vote on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I watched it come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched it work its way through the
Colorado process and I watched people
[SPEAKER_01]: argue and fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read the articles and sent the emails
and it just, there was some progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original bill was a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we go on like 42 minutes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got anything you want to say to start
wrapping up the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Register to vote and start paying
attention to politics and hopefully we can
[SPEAKER_01]: stop getting just fucked as a community
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an election this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's talking about 2016 and who's
going to be the next president.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an election between now and then
that no one's really talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Pueblo, it's real important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be voting on rec shops in
the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me that I kind of messed up the
last report I said on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me because I don't want to be
wrong on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was episode 69 or 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember which.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you covered recently the Pueblo city
council voted not to license rec shops in
[SPEAKER_01]: the city and they punted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the voters are going to decide on
some marijuana question or another in
[SPEAKER_01]: November.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city council has no idea what they're
going to ask the voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be the 11 page nonsense
ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't vote on last Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully it'll be a short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want rec stores in the city?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes or no, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I asked city council directly,
I got a snarky response from one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, show up to those meetings and find
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I've said I'm impartial to rec
stores in the city, but bring it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a rec store on our city.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need those jobs and taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo is a poor city full of poor people
who need jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can give us 12 jobs by opening
a dispensary, that's 12 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people our age, the 24 to 35 range
that's been kind of fucked for the past 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, it finally got something to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that got out of college and
realized that there's nothing to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: do with that college degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to look you straight in the face
when I say that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my sociology degree makes shit less
confusing to me personally, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: do fuck off for my bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to work in a dispensary
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finally got something for you to do
because of this industry and it's helping
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do support a dispensary in the city
of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my opinion matters to you at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote yes, when it comes time to ask about
opening dispensaries in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: town, because we need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure your friends are registered to
vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure your lady or your man are
registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're out here and you've got a crew
and all of you are in those nice ass hats
[SPEAKER_01]: with those pins, make sure you're
registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gateway to politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have cared about politics at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my talking points for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not have cared about politics and
voting and gone to city council and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: at all had I not gotten involved in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a gateway drug, man,
to politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've survived for so long by being
invisible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was how we thrived and survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were invisible.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one noticed us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we stayed out of everybody's line of
sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now if we don't all stand up real
soon, we're not going to have legal
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in any state anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that have cannabis legalized in
your states, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington just fucked up royal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you read about that today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so much news that I don't know
what happened in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain is overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was focused on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back maybe six, eight months ago,
Colorado's, they did the first underage
[SPEAKER_01]: bi-sting and they hit 20 dispensaries in
Colorado and up and tall and proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not one of them failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to go boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just stung Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four of 22 failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you fuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope somebody fire bombs your fucking
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they take your license and shit in
your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Mike's opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of agree, but not as fiercely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does suck, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give you the opportunity to make a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent them a letter a week in advance
saying, we're going to sting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four of them did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give one of those credit to a
stupid ass employee.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people should be crucified at
Hempfest next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we're going to fucking have this
business that you're allowed to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: billion dollars with and sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're letting us play.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like mom's away and your
dad's like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could watch playboy while she's gone
and fucking now you're fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're jerking off in front of the
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's zip it up and do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire bomb them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I defended that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, don't really, don't really fire
bomb them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you shot, pull them up,
the store names are in the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you live in Seattle and you
used to shop there, don't anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to pee when you're walking
past, hit up their window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we, I can support that
statement on the show because when their
[SPEAKER_01]: window gets pissed on, this statement is
brought to you by white Mike, not the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that Mike's got us pissing on
windows, I think it's almost time to wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: up the damn show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not prompt him for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She don't listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to remind all my friends to say hi
to their wives when they're on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for dinner, sweetie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Hey girl, my wife, my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my wife this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it the whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Doug Benson and I was in the front
row and he said, my wife on stage or
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else said my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went, my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the people on stage heard me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of awkward for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow Mike on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00]: It might be Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I'll be back in a couple of
days with another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not forget about that perpetual grow
episode I told you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've been writing that and
more shit keeps popping up to do shows
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big news week guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike was around and I was like,
let's do this.

the grow from your heart podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: your source for cannabis news education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots band for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge thanks to Kat Kuh and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn that music down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is going to turn down a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get the party started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of getting the party started,
big shout out to my friends Deez,
[SPEAKER_00]: Roxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, who else is on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to check on something real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk more about this later,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kenny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Cody and shout out to Cody,
another Cody, two Cody's and Roxy also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of friends of mine that are
watching me record this show live right
[SPEAKER_00]: now on Bong TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't hear the show, but they are
watching me record it on my webcam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the chat room getting pumped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting a little energy before the
show, taking a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, why turn off the cam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just let those guys watch?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys hear this, this is the
episode that you're watching that you
[SPEAKER_00]: watched past tense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, shout out to the Bong TV crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no ads for this episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even going to do any
commercials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get right down to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been promising you guys a lesson on
how to set up a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually took a lot of time and figured
out how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got it figured out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, my arms are a little bit rubbery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working through my paperwork here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played my drums for about a good solid
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I beat the shit out of those drums and I
needed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't played the drums in quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to make some space where the
drums were for some grow things,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, but then I had that space
available, set up a big ... I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the drum set on the podcast,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to tell you more about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an eight, a 10, a 12,
a 14, 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 inch tom, 22 inch kick drum,
14 inch snare drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just tore the shit out of that kit all
day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find the notes here that are
in my phone and we will talk about this
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lesson that I wrote for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to the point here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to talk through the
dabness here for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find my way through these clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Mystic Reads crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So episode 73, scheduling a perpetual
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're scheduling a perpetual grow,
a few things you need to keep in mind are
[SPEAKER_00]: things like your plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a medical state like
Colorado, where I am, you have a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count and you have to stay within that to
be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a good way to help you stay
within your plant count and produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of medicine or recreational
cannabis you need to supply yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you need to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much herb do you require to keep
yourself supplied without trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: stingy, without trying to make a bunch of
money?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you realistically want to grow
and how often do you need to grow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be something we're going
to talk about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we will talk about how much space
it's going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what will really dictate your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff is covered in previous
episodes, you guys, but we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back over a lot of it and we will,
by the end, you will have a perpetual grow
[SPEAKER_00]: going if you follow this, I guess it's a
recipe I wrote here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, holy shit, excuse my throat
clearing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This perpetual lesson is going to be based
on one 1000 watt flowering light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This covers about a four by four or a five
by five square foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to create a perpetual grow
that suits your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using more lights, simply
multiply this method by however many
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you're using or however you seem
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, email me,
growfromyourheart.hotmail.com and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: help adjust this recipe for your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you about my perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a four light set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up and I fill the whole light area with a
set of plants and harvest one light every
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where you need to make a
decision on your perpetual setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to decide if you want to start a
crop under a light and finish the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: crop and then have another set of plants
ready as soon as that's done for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that as soon as you chop down that
room, that light of plants, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that were in veg in another room as
soon as they're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to refill the entire room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to kind of stagger it a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a little, in my opinion,
I like having a perpetual instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: having a whole bunch of herb to harvest
all at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a really daunting task,
in my opinion, to try to harvest four
[SPEAKER_00]: lights worth of cannabis all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh guys, excuse my throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll go away here after a couple of
minutes, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're working with one strain,
where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you need to decide if you want to
start the whole crop and run the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to stagger your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a harvest every 30 days or two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with one strain,
that's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got multiple strains,
try to get strains that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to time it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to get strains that are all about
eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your ideal setup for a perpetual
cycle under one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our main goal here is to have the rooms
moving constantly with as little downtime
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible to keep your production at its
maximum without any interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have any interruptions
in your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you guys, let's see,
I'll talk a little bit about my four
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal grow is a perpetual setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvest one light every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying, I'd rather trim one
light worth of buds, which for me is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound than four lights, which would be
four pounds easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a pound and a half,
sometimes it's more, just depends on what
[SPEAKER_00]: strains I'm running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm harvesting every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that every two weeks I'm cutting
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking clones out of the cloner,
putting them into cups and I'm harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have four flowering lights in my
flowering area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two lights in my vegging area and I
have a separate light for my moms and
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about every 14 days, I cut 12
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 14 days, those clones go into cups
and go under a light in my mom and clone
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be like a T5 or a metal halide
light, or even an LED if you're into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants that I cut will stay in the
cups for about two weeks before they're
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted into seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I'm going to give you a lot
of detail about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going kind of fast right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you a setup on mine and then
I'll get into a lot of detail in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can fit 12 seven gallon pots under my
two veg lights comfortably.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives them enough space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, some of these are,
we got shit all the way from one week up
[SPEAKER_00]: to eight weeks old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones on the far end there,
they're real little, so we can squish
[SPEAKER_00]: those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other ones over there on that end
are a little larger, so they need more
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fit 12 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants are in the seven gallon
pots, they'll hang out in the bedroom for
[SPEAKER_00]: like 30 to 45 days, depending on the
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to set up this perpetual,
it'll probably work out to exactly eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks if you do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use large pots so I can keep big plants
and keep my plant count down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was talking about earlier,
Colorado is limited by plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting as much from each plant is
important, as much as you can from each
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have four sets of seven gallon pots
under my veg lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have plants in veg for two,
four, six, and eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants that had been in veg for
eight weeks will go into the flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: on week nine and more plants will be
dropped into seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be slid over four spaces
and the empty spaces I just made will be
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be Tetris doll right over the
left so that it's right by the door to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, every two weeks I'm
harvesting a light, I'm cutting more
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, I'm putting clones into cups,
putting cups into pots, and I'm keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycle moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while maintaining a pest management
regimen, I'm lollipopping these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work to do in there,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just slack off, but it's a lot
of work and it pays off every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pound of herb harvested for
myself every two weeks if I do this
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically my setup there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys might not have four lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about getting your perpetual
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to reach over and plug this phone
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have a perpetual grow, you'll need a
solid mother plant or a source of reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to rely on somebody else for
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely recommend keeping a
mother plant if you have a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if I haven't talked thoroughly
enough about mother plants, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: write a note right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write a note to talk about mother
plants in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can kind of talk about keeping
a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be a whole nother episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Writing it down, mother plant episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it takes me a long time to write,
but I'd rather be able to read it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a good mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about selecting a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go way into depth on that for you if
I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this mother plant, for the mother
plant, you need a light cycle that stays
[SPEAKER_00]: on in a vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend, of course, the 18 on and six
off, or you can try 19.5 if that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that because I see the plants growing
and it keeps any sativas from auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some sativas that like to auto
flower if the light cycle changes just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that 19.5, that extra hour will keep
them from doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep your mother plants and
your clones and these cups on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one light, you can fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have one good size fluorescent
light, you can fit your cloner and a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of cups with clones in there underneath
that T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can probably fit a good size
mother plant underneath there also if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know two of those T5 fixtures would
definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this example, Mike and I were
talking and of course I had to ask Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: for some help because I was getting stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mike for helping me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up with the idea to use a two five
by five grow tents because that's when he
[SPEAKER_00]: met me, I was grown in grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned a lot from those grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using two of those five by five
grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have grow tents, you can use
a bedroom or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can divide it into two spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your flowering space is totally
dark during the night cycle, you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress enough how important it is
to have a totally dark night cycle in your
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering room.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to use two five by five
tents, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can divide it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is a flowering hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a veg space, one's a flowering hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the one flowering space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five by five with a thousand watt
light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our other room is a five by five room or
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be our veg and mom space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually going to take a couple of
weeks to get your perpetual grow flowing
[SPEAKER_00]: and productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it starts, the flow should run
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan ahead and stay on top of your
chores, don't get lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get complacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to stay in there and be on top of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my example, we're going to set up a
perpetual grow to harvest one large plant
[SPEAKER_00]: every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your goal is four ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to put one seven gallon pot
under the light every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start with a mother plant or
some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we'll start with a
healthy mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have your mom's, your mom rooms
or huts built and running before we even
[SPEAKER_00]: take the first clone for the perpetual
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your rooms happy and your
mother plant is nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we cut clones to start our cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using like rapid
routers or if you're using Rockwell cubes
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're using an easy cloner,
but either way, two weeks is your due
[SPEAKER_00]: date.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these clones, they've got to be rooted
and ready to rock in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not proficient in cloning,
I would recommend cutting these clones
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take some practice, get some practice
and get some clones going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the five by five hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one 1000 watt flowering light in a
five by five area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what would happen on week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would cut clones and let them root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if for this one light situation,
we only need one clone out of this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut some clones and hopefully in 14
days, one of those clones is rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now week two, you don't have much to do
except make sure the clones are rooted and
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week three of the perpetual cycle,
you're going to take more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: First you have to, I guess, take the
clones out of the cloning area,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into cups, and then you're also
going to cut more clones for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're only going to need one keeper
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those clones that you just put into
cups, you're going to let them go for 14
[SPEAKER_00]: more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll just pick the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clones that you just put in the
cloner in 14 days, you're going to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the best one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only need one at a time to survive,
but cut extras you guys, cause it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: better to have some to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week four, week four is another chill
week, but make sure the cups and the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones are happy and as healthy as you can
make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mother plant you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Ooh, I didn't add that in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we're going to need to make love
to the mother plant every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get in there and trim that sexy
bitch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess taking clones every two weeks,
you'll be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I should have made a note of.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week five, week five is where we start to
get busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we need to put the clones into
cups of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to cut more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we need to, uh, we only need one
keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, every two weeks, but I would
take a few extras and choose from the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote that down a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the plants that we cut that we put
into cups two weeks ago will now go into
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon pots and go under the veg
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in that five by five hut,
you should have plenty of room for your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of clones, a couple of cups
and four, seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in week five, uh, we're going to put
one seven gallon pot under the veg lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's going to sit there for eight
weeks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you have your first veg plant in
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're showing some progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that one little itty bitty plant
in a seven gallon pot and it's only taken
[SPEAKER_00]: five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week six is kind of another chill week,
but you have to make sure all your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking good because now you're really
setting the pace for your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to watch for bugs,
uh, start doing any pruning and training
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're getting good on your
cloning game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a lot of practice by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just start perfecting shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start really paying attention to details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a rhythm going, start paying
attention to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at about 16, uh, yeah, after a couple
of edits here, we should be hit about 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week seven, um, for week seven,
we need to put the clones out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning area into cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need to cut more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember guys, we just need one,
but cut several.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then we need to put another clone into
a seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that goes under that veg light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have two of our first four
plants under the veg light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one has seven more weeks or
no, it's got, uh, yeah, we're going on odd
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would have six more weeks to cook
before it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one's got a few more weeks to
cook before it's going to go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's now got eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other one's got six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're going to be harvesting every
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week eight is another week to focus on
training and pruning and plant health and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping your mother plant happy,
checking for bugs, going in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up the bottoms of all the plants
that are in the, uh, vegging area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stuff to do every week,
even though we're not doing the big cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: on the even numbered weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week nine, I'm sure you're catching on
by now, take the clones out of the cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into cups, cut new clones,
put a clone from a cup into a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and into the veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got three seven gallon pots
under the veg light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of them is getting big and bushy
by now and it's almost time to flower that
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you want to do any topping or
anything or any pruning to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: now's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, week 10 is another off week,
but it's a good time to check for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've been going at it for 10 weeks
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check all of your equipment out,
uh, clean up all your fans, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the floor is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and clean everything up
on week 10 week 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put clones into cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put our favorite clone into
a seven gallon pot and put that into the
[SPEAKER_00]: veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have got four seven gallon pots
in your room is full and we will flower
[SPEAKER_00]: out our first plant in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds like a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take us 13 weeks to flower
our first plant before we even start
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering our first plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trust me, once you get this rhythm
going, it's totally going to be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week 12, this is the last week before
we start flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your bloom room is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that five by five flowering room
cleaned up sparkly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the floor is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the ceiling is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you did go in there and clean it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, clean it one more
time and then inspect it one more time and
[SPEAKER_00]: find what you missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's something that you missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a fire extinguisher near your
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a smoke detector near your
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably two things you forgot
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to say what could
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm getting at, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a smoke detector, put it near your
grow, get a fire extinguisher and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the room so that in the worst
case scenario, you don't have to run in
[SPEAKER_00]: there to get the fire extinguisher to put
the fucking fire out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it outside of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do that for me, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your room is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is when it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first day we start the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today you get to move that large as plant
into the flowering room and begin the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in eight to nine weeks,
hopefully 60 days, we'll have buds to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every two weeks after that,
you can harvest if you keep this rhythm
[SPEAKER_00]: going properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious about the scheduling of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fuck this up, you will be way
behind and everything will fall apart
[SPEAKER_00]: because you will miss a beat and you won't
know where to jump back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like playing a really fast song.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you jumped off that beat,
it's going to take a minute to recover and
[SPEAKER_00]: your lungs and your smoking habits are
definitely going to notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move that big plant that you've been
working on that's been in veg for eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant was in veg for eight weeks,
in a cup for two weeks and in a cloner for
[SPEAKER_00]: two other weeks, 12 weeks of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're just now moving that sucker
into the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you move that into the flowering
room, feed it as flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to feed it flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about what to feed and stuff
on week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed that plant, it's flowering newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to, you guessed it,
take a clone out of the cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into a cup, cut more clones,
put your favorite cup into a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and replace that seven gallon pot that
you just moved into the flowering room
[SPEAKER_00]: with a fresh pot and a little baby plant
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got one plant in flower and
you should have four plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our goal is to keep this moving and
add a plant into the room every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to cut clones, put clones into
cups, put a cup into a seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: drag a fresh plant into the flowering room
every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually you will also be harvesting
a plant every two weeks if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: a 56 to 60 day strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if that went right, that means that
every two weeks you'll be pulling off
[SPEAKER_00]: about a quarter pound of herb for yourself
if you do this properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will become a small part-time job for
yourself to maintain this, but the more
[SPEAKER_00]: work and love you put into it,
the better your product will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, how is your herb so
good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I go in the grow room for
hours every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touch every single plant with my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look on the bottoms of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk in there in the morning and I'm
like, which plant haven't I spent enough
[SPEAKER_00]: time with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pick one and I turn the leaves
upside down and I look at the bottoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves and make sure there are no
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look around the room and I just
stare into the room like an old guy
[SPEAKER_00]: staring off the porch into nothing,
but I'm looking around the room to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a problem that maybe I didn't miss
or maybe if there's something I could
[SPEAKER_00]: tweak to make the airflow a little bit
better to control the temperature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity just a little bit better when I'm
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be in there, do some work, keep on top
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what the fuck started
that round.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after eight weeks, it'll be time to
harvest that first plant that you put into
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need a few extra days for the plant
to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just squeeze that plant in there for the
last few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have this available,
put that plant in its own dark room for
[SPEAKER_00]: two days before you harvest it and it will
kind of dense up the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'll kind of make it a little
more resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it does make it kind of more dense
is the word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tightens up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 48 hours of dark kind of shocks the
plant and makes it kick out the last bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of resin that it can put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows it's going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you should have a full perpetual
setup that should yield three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces of herb every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do this right, you can keep
your plant count down to like 10 or 15 if
[SPEAKER_00]: you only have one mother plant and you get
good at cloning because you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have four in flower and then you're going
to have four in your veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's eight plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your mother plant and then
you've got that one that's in a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 10 plants right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a couple of extra clones and
have a couple of extra mother plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, that's going to put
you up near 15 or 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dude, you're pulling a quarter pound
of herb with 10 plants in your house and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using two, maybe three lights doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to work for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your other option here would be to veg
all four of your plants for 30 to 45 days
[SPEAKER_00]: and throw them all into the flowering
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I was saying, when it comes to
harvesting all that pot, you're hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pull off a pound of wheat here,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a pound and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just burped that root beer right into
the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rude, rude, rude rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hoping to pull a pound and a
quarter, pound and a half herb off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather trim, you know,
three to five ounces every two weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: give my wrist a break than be at it
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: For two weeks straight because it gets
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start cutting down plants and they're
all ripe at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you got shit drying all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go into panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to trim this whole pound of herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trim usually myself and one,
maybe two other people at the table
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just gets crowded and it gets
loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd rather keep it peaceful and have
less people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of quiet for my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I do the perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also makes you feel like
something's happening instead of waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 days for that damn crop to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, oh, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't feel like it's so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the next crop is 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I started one 40 days ago,
and then what's 40 minus 14, I fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: myself picking a weird number like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I picked one seven weeks ago and
started it, then I'm going to have one in
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to have one in two
weeks after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought ahead, I'm rambling
because I took a lot of fat dads and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you choose to run them all at one
time, you should have plants in that
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom ready to flower as soon as that
room is empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to keep a mother
plant and then four pots, four seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots for about eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll need clones for two weeks,
cups for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need four of them, four clones,
four cups, two weeks each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you throw those into the seven
gallon pots and let those go for eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you chop that other room,
you throw those plants in there that same
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do it all at once,
or you can do two plants every 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's easier for you, if you'd rather
have a half a pound of herb every 30 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do that as this is completely
adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just the best I could come up
with since I don't know your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find it useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you put it to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you start pulling off somewhere
between three and five ounces for yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: or your patients every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good supply of medicine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking more than that,
well, I can't judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to try to judge you for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have hardcore Dab syndrome like
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
close to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys listening to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taunting you and teasing you
about this perpetual grow episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see why it took me a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me 13 weeks to get to the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it went really quickly with
all of the stuff that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I skipped anything, please correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay so much more attention when I do
like a 30 minute episode, so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start wrapping up the show like a fat
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks a lot for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back next Monday with a fresh
episode for you.

view of more folks, which will make more
[SPEAKER_00]: people grow better cannabis, which means

[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it right now so that I can
not tell you the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so much shit going on on the
computer right now that I wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised if it didn't want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lagging a little, but we'll get
there, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get there together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The appropriate web address.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be tinychat.com slash btvlivemain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm in that chat room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I am in the other chat room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually late at night when I am bored
and can't sleep and I've got a lot on my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind and I'm trying to write a podcast and
I need a dab break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jump in here and chat with these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deez is shaking his head right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't know I'm still watching him.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Deez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends in the
chat room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys keep me sane late at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Us growers have weird hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need friends online like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all you guys who are listening
to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been rambling on for a long time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put better shows together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can tell that my head wound is
definitely clearing up and I also want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give a big shout out to AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a boost in your brain and you
don't want to do caffeine or yerba mate
[SPEAKER_00]: because it makes you too jittery or
something, I definitely recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: AlphaBrain from onit.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say that shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just sounded like I was doing a paid ad
and they did not pay me to say that is
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my head feel a lot better after my
head injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the clouds go away and it
obviously made me a little rambly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I did you a lot of good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're setting up a perpetual grow
right now as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my Ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, you guys, take a fat dab
and give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have anything to do on a
Saturday night because we're a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: bums and now we're like, why don't we do
something productive and record a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some time to good use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, put our time to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put our sugar to good use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be bouncing off the walls here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Amy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Amy's Donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Amy's Donuts in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whoever was the one sad lonely guy
working tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to make you laugh, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't going to stop and get donuts,
but as we drove by, we could see into the
[SPEAKER_00]: building that there was just one dude
standing there, staring out the window,
[SPEAKER_00]: watching traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I predicted that if we waited four
hours without going, he may kill him.
[SPEAKER_00]: himself, standing there staring out the
window.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked so sad and lonely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had to go cheer him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought some donuts and Mike gave the
dude a fat tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nice of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fat for Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was a donut tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I handed it to him,
it was kind of clear that he did not
[SPEAKER_01]: expect to get tipped on this shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then now he's got money for whatever
he does after work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's at least got a story to tell at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two super high guys came through and
bought a lot of donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the directions were to fill the
box with something, quote, colorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I want one of these specific
donuts because they're tasty as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, just put colorful
shit in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he met that goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking forward to eating the lime
green, possibly apple flavored one later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them got marshmallow on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try to stay away from the
marshmallow products, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I've had a lot of sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about donuts for almost
three minutes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are no ads on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I told Mike, he was talking
about news.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I tweeted you some good news
and no, not necessarily good news,
[SPEAKER_00]: good news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not all good news, but he tweeted
that shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you can go ahead and use
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, why don't you go
ahead and be like my news guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you send me all the news about
cannabis that you can find?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way I can work on the grow
lessons and we can get Mike doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: news for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have to read all the news and
review it, but Mike's searching out the
[SPEAKER_00]: news a little more for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to keep doing that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got to keep the people
informed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to do a, this shows
news, the grow, the spot, my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus on what you do best, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got their wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having you do some news is fully part
of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely going to make it a little
bit of an improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, if you get bored on the news shows,
I apologize, but I think it's just as
[SPEAKER_00]: important as the lessons and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet at both of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us who you want more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find a news article you want me
to read, you can tweet it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's find one of these news
articles we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ready for this dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with, uh, let's start with
Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you done now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's usually some fucked up shit we
hear about from Florida, but this one
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't involve a goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not involve a chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: No face eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bath salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually, this is a step in the
right direction for Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida is going the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I've got a giant slide on my
screen right in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did that article go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm going to have to refresh because
this website I am using is filled with ads
[SPEAKER_00]: that I cannot find the article under.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some good news coming out
of Florida this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scrolling to the article right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the headline is Florida low THC
medical marijuana law passes major hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys kind of know where this
is headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, this is actually from the
first coast news.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to give them credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, we've shared their emotional
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents from all over the state have been
waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting to get their hands on Charlotte's
web, a low THC form of medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat illnesses their children have
such as epilepsy, seizures, and cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says from Tallahassee, Florida,
we've shared their emotional stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents from all over the state have been
waiting, waiting to get their hands on
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's web, a low THC form of medical
marijuana to treat illnesses in their
[SPEAKER_00]: children, such as epilepsy, seizures,
and cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now finally on Wednesday, they got an
answer when a judge threw out a lawsuit
[SPEAKER_00]: holding up the implementation of the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Sharkey started the medical marijuana
business association.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's followed the entire process of
Charlotte's web from lawmakers legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: it last year to several lawsuits from
potential growers, halting the sale of the
[SPEAKER_00]: drug to today with a sale date in sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule that was finally approved was
fair and balanced Sharkey said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long discussion and dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long discussion and dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's been some frustration
with it, but here we are with a rule
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry guys, I'm trying to cough and read
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have people submitting applications
to become dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Florida is ready for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida's department of health has been
the agency in charge of implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's web.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expecting or they're expected to
take applications from eligible growers
[SPEAKER_00]: within three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the law, only five will be chosen to
sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty soon in Florida, there will be
five dispensaries selling Charlotte's web
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mixed emotions about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like you got shit to say already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, I feel a little bad because
I didn't follow the story as closely as I
[SPEAKER_01]: follow most cannabis news because it's
another Charlotte's web state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while any progress towards medical
marijuana access is huge and awesome,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's another big win for reality and
science, CBD only is silly and just a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a half step that no one needs to take
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: California has been medical since 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this CBD stuff and Charlotte's web
came out of our medical marijuana system
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is fantastic medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to the vote last year in
Florida, they've got CBD only now,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks to this law, but it's only
Charlotte's web specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only strain they can sell and
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realm of caring did an amazing job
trademarking and getting their name out
[SPEAKER_01]: and pitching it as safe and not
intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add that and Sanjay Gupta together and
we've got 13 CBD only states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said I had mixed emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my opinions is like you said,
it's great that we have medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: in Florida now so that these kids can get
their medicine and the parents don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to watch their children suffer and the
kids can live a happy normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that CBD only medicine
is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also like you're saying, this one
company that owns the Charlotte's web is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make money off of this like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not a cool way to go about
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, if you really think about
it, the article talks about the kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not just children in Florida that
would be accessing Charlotte's web
[SPEAKER_01]: medications through these five
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all the adult patients with all of
those conditions as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about a huge number of
people, five business or five store
[SPEAKER_01]: locations, one product brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to run out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be huge product
limitations and it's going to be like too
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous cost per gram like it is out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the price off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost threw out a random number,
but I don't want to do that because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculously high, but I don't want to be
wrong about how ridiculously high.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you live with that answer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something that Mike said that
the THC is good medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something I feel about,
we used to call it the entourage effect in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the industry term has moved to the
synergistic effect, and that's the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabinoids, the palliates,
the terpenoids, the flavonoids and the
[SPEAKER_00]: esters all working together to provide you
a medicinal benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just by isolating the CBD,
I don't think you're getting the full
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit of the medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to say it works with the
kids and the kids don't have seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, CBD medicine doesn't do
anything for my medical condition that I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great for me, but it doesn't do
everything I need it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the THC half of that puzzle as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this with the, there's been a
hundred percent THC pill called Marinal on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one likes it because it doesn't have
the rest of the cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need that balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried sativa X.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just called it sativa X.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one company in Europe that's doing
a whole plant extract where they're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole raw marijuana plant and making
some sort of, I think it's a sublingual
[SPEAKER_01]: spray is spread under your tongue like
Benaka.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were testing it for MS the last I
read.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are companies looking at whole
marijuana plant extract rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: isolating one or two components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your friend Dave listen to the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea he should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you do bro, shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought of you when he said that we've
got a friend that could benefit from this
[SPEAKER_00]: sublingual spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sublingual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spat that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to work for a lot of
people, but I'm a medical smoker and I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely need my THC heavy sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out for going the right
direction, Florida for trying to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this will open the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do they have to just go with CBD
medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the end of what they have going
for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's another group working
towards getting a legalization on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ballot in Florida, either medical or rec
again in the next presidential,
[SPEAKER_01]: but so far it's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, excuse me guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had sugary Dr. Pepper and donuts and my
voice is already all fucked up from the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, but we can look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sick kids who have seizures and
epilepsy and cancer and things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: that need help can now get the CBD
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people like you and I that are in
our thirties that know some people that
[SPEAKER_00]: know some people that aren't, we're able
bodied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go out and get some herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids, those kids needed it way more
than the folks that want the sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps a lot still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan, but at the same time,
I remember how many epilepsy patients used
[SPEAKER_01]: to come into the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember, I mean, I remember them enough
to have researched some of this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: after we left and THC is fairly effective
on treating seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having some THC in an anti-seizure
medication that's made from cannabis makes
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole lot of sense in Charlotte's web
specific laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't end up with Charlotte's web
because it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw it working great for seizures and
dove into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found it had no THC and that certain
medical patients were looking for a non
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxicating medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're afraid to give the THC to the
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big, scary part here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a much better pitch when there's
absolutely no THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there when you can just say straight
up, there's no high to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no intoxicating effect,
but an intoxicating effect doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: non-medical effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means also intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get out of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a couple of minutes on that
news topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to bore the folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD was big in the news this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is going to remain big in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the next little while,
what's the next, this is a random
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next anabinoid to pop up that's
going to be popular?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping it's CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the good fortune to get a small
sample of CBG capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was during a period of time where I
had some bad back pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh Lordy, they helped me get through
some long shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did those come from within our circle?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made me sleep like a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I need some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been having some sleep issues lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking too much sativa and
taking that alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more reason to get caregivers back
into the testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about this alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I take it too late in the day,
it gives me the most craziest dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just did an article from Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump to our hometown here in the
lovely steel city, Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_00]: 719.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the headline here is Pueblo County
wants to keep excess weed money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is by Jeff Tucker from the
Pueblo Chieftain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, Pueblo County will be asking
voters whether they want the equivalent of
[SPEAKER_00]: about three spins of the city park kiddies
ride, or if they would rather let the
[SPEAKER_00]: government use a little less than $150,000
in excess marijuana revenues for something
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys that aren't from Pueblo, that's a
local joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a park here with some kiddie
rides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs like 50 cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're saying that they're going to
write a check for about three spins on
[SPEAKER_00]: those shitty rides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they'd rather let the city just keep
the money in the excess marijuana revenues
[SPEAKER_00]: and use it for something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says the Pueblo Board of County
Commissioners instructed County Attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Steidar on Wednesday to start work on
a ballot language that will give voters an
[SPEAKER_00]: option on what to do with the marijuana
sales tax money they collected in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of the exemption, the 3.5% sales
tax from the State Taxpayers Bill of
[SPEAKER_00]: Rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure I read that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.5% sales tax from the State Taxpayers
Bill of Rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The county made an estimated income of
$400,000 from the marijuana sales tax
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first year of legal recreational
sales in Pueblo County, $548,479 was
[SPEAKER_00]: collected from sales tax, meaning that
$148,479 is due back to the public unless
[SPEAKER_00]: voters give the county approval to keep
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let them keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they can fill some of the damn
potholes that are all over this city
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny that you say that the county
raked in a huge amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like $1.7 million just in Pueblo
County last year from the marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of that was taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of that was like fees and application
fees and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Pueblo West Metropolitan District
whined that all the shops were there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they weren't getting a special cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the county commissioners broke them off
like two or three hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're throwing it all into their
streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need their streets repaired as
badly as we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a good argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shops are all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the county said, here's your cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, thanks for the road money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it an extra shitty winter or are the
roads just not getting paid attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've been terrible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the cited issues I caught down at
City Council is our roads right now to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them up to speed at the pace we're doing
just to get the Pueblo stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how bad our infrastructure stuff is
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not just Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all over the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why bridges are collapsing and
trains are crashing.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to invest in infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather have not heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the big reasons to vote this
year, make sure you're registered to vote
[SPEAKER_01]: for this November election is if you're in
Colorado, you're going to have half a
[SPEAKER_01]: dozen marijuana questions, almost all of
which are your state asking if they can
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the extra tax revenue they collected
last year, your county asking the same
[SPEAKER_01]: question, your city asking the same
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get registered to vote, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Register to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guys, in the future, Mike is going to
come do an episode for us all about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: get yourself into politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ready to lobby for cannabis or
anything else, Mike is going to come kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of teach us a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put him on the spot now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just looked at me like, shit,
now I really have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just be a quickie, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just teach my friends that are listening
how to get into politics, how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves started, get them going to
council meetings and shaking hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike will get you on the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our article from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long we've been recording
before we jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some time left.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could definitely go for a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want CBD or THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, well, your options are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tora borah that was grown by myself
and extracted by her good friends at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out family, much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from our good friends over at
TerpX, Terpy Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up fellas?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I picked this up over at the Green and
Healthy Wellness in lovely Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a week or two ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice guys, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to John John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great fellas.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Randalls Jr. What's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some Durbin poison on the Sativa
end of things, and we've got some 818
[SPEAKER_00]: headband, which in my opinion is more on
the indica side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm on getting dug with high
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's poison time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for the poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to get sued if I do that
too much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 seconds?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rules around that and I read
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as I'm not making money,
it's cool if nobody gets mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get offended, they can make me
take it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really it's like a fair use act law.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just talking out of my ass kind of
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember exactly what I read,
but you can and can't at the same time and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's up to whoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get permission, then I can use
whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the songs I use in the intros and
outros, Mystic Roots Band has given me
[SPEAKER_00]: full permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Nickatee has given me permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally just tried to stab the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike held up the rig and you're not,
I don't know if that was your second time
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it or if you're the second person,
but he put his mouth full on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone and tried to dab through the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to put the dab on the nail and for
some reason put my face on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was going to do anything for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the process happen in your brain and
it was fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start reading this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember what the hell I was
saying anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feds tell their employees to stay away
from marijuana, even in states that have
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a federal agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Terpy boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Terpy crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get them back on the
podcast again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have my car back here within the next
few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be able to go do a podcast with
the Terpy boy crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the cannabis grand crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happening as we record right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we were there, but I was not
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article, if you're a mailman,
what a mail person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't say mailman because they're a
female mail carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a mail carrier, if you,
is this a state park people?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work for the department of
wildlife, anybody that works for the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal government, it's a huge number of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: IRS, FBI, IRS can't smoke weed no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to crunch numbers like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's read the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government wants to clear with
its federal employees that it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that might live in states that have
reformed their marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana remains illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In guidance issued this week from
Catherine Archuleta, director of the U S
[SPEAKER_00]: office of personal management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's personnel management to the heads
of all federal departments and agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Archuleta says in no uncertain terms that
marijuana use for the more than 4.1
[SPEAKER_00]: million federal employees across the
nation is banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a shocker.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about, man, people need to smoke
their medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what makes you feel better,
you need to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Schedule one, high level of abuse,
no medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds have no heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law on marijuana remains
unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: She writes in a letter announcing the
guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got four legal states,
30 some medical states, 23 medical states,
[SPEAKER_01]: and 13 CBD only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not one of them came with worker
protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take any other intoxicating
medication you feel like or are prescribed
[SPEAKER_01]: or your doctor recommends, but not
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's, who, how do we go about writing
the worker protection rules?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who does that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably not going to happen in our
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your new job, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your new calling in life.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's got to pay me for that amount of
lobbying.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, click the donate button.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know where I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a donate button and you,
you write Mike on there and then Mike will
[SPEAKER_00]: use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that transmission is done getting
paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, don't remind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll transfer that over to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't remind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike just, he's not even reading the
article and he just said while forced
[SPEAKER_00]: states have legal, you just read part of
the article out of your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So federal employees are also part of the
drug free workplace act guidelines,
[SPEAKER_00]: which ban any use of illegal drugs on and
off duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, most of the routine drug
testing of federal employees primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs within federal agencies that have
personnel with safety sensitive jobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: like those working in law enforcement or
national security.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be a good time to mention to
those of you living in not Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about moving to heaven and for
our wonderful weed laws that have a job
[SPEAKER_01]: when you get here, because they're going
to drug test just like the one in
[SPEAKER_01]: Minneapolis, wherever you're flying from,
Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend that had to pass a drug
test yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, she's like, how do I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have to take a P test, I don't even
want to work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do that back before Dabsworth
thing and Dabsworth thing for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've probably forgotten exactly how to
do that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My way of doing it is the only way I can
do it is use fake piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only way I've ever been able to
pass a P test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go buy that fake pee and keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took breaks and just, I was just be
sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never that painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time, dude, I went 63 days without
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take me years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's like, you had to have smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, I went to Reggae on
the Rocks with my brother Bradley and
[SPEAKER_00]: rolled down the windows when he puffed and
I did not puff at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was laughing at me and I still failed
the P test.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a fed in any way,
who else is a fed?
[SPEAKER_00]: We always said mailman's, park rangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it applies to all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: C-dot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of different professions,
I suppose is the easiest way to say it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have rules that the feds get to lay
out, regulations that the feds get to lay
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it comes with tax breaks if,
and one of those ifs is almost always drug
[SPEAKER_01]: free workplace act, which is why shit like
McDonald's drug test, like mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to have to, they're all
going to be kiosks pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That article actually came from the
Huffington Post by a dude named Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me read your article
there, Matt Ferner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably get in one more article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make it a good one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got about five minutes before I want to
start wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's going to be long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap this up with a funny one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we talked a whole bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you made it to the 30 minute mark in
this show, here is something for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hanging in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is good, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and where is this from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Pendleton, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, man asks city to ban fart
smells for a good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this came from the Huffington Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written by Hillary Henson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to like this also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says a resident of Pendleton,
Oregon has written a letter requesting the
[SPEAKER_00]: city council ban the smell of farts in the
community, but he has good reason to be
[SPEAKER_00]: raising a stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, the city of Pendleton uploaded
its nuisance ordinance to cover the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana, NBC reported at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that even though recreational
marijuana will be legal in Oregon starting
[SPEAKER_00]: in July, a person can be fined up to $500
if someone complains they smell marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from that person's property.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a letter published in the East
Oregonian on Thursday, someone who signed
[SPEAKER_00]: his name as Peter Walters merely asked
that council members take the next logical
[SPEAKER_00]: step and start regulating a far more
noxious sin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was with great relief Thursday when I
read the East Oregonian that Pendleton
[SPEAKER_00]: city council took the time to pass an
amendment to the city's nuisance order
[SPEAKER_00]: banning marijuana order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly there has been no issue of greater
importance facing the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that this important work has been
completed, I hope the council will move on
[SPEAKER_00]: to restricting the other offensive smell
that plagues our community, farts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walters who is pretty clearly mocking the
marijuana ordinances notes, some habitual
[SPEAKER_00]: farters argue that they need to fart for
medical reasons, but that doesn't mean my
[SPEAKER_00]: kids should have to smell their farts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an elected official and you
behave absurdly, people have the right to
[SPEAKER_01]: mock the living shit out of you by sending
you public letters asking you to ban the
[SPEAKER_01]: smell of farts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo last summer, we passed a smell
ordinance down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's considered automatically a yes,
that's definitely offensive thing if your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor whines about the smell of your
pot garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be smoking marijuana on your porch
and that smell cannot be considered
[SPEAKER_01]: automatically offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But growing marijuana is automatically
offensive by city ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only odor that you can get in
trouble for in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if this passes, I pretty much can't
go to Pendleton, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be fined 500 bucks every couple of
minutes out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a farting fool on some days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's this vegetarian diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what do it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty soon you guys in Pendleton,
Oregon, they're going to ban farts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, but I think that's a great way
to respond to some dipshit ordinances made
[SPEAKER_00]: by some dipshit people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the guy who signed his
name as Peter Walters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way to go, Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're one of my heroes today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some more news, but we're going
to save that for another episode because
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys really like these 30 minute
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Mike, thanks for hanging out with me
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for recording the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for kind of being my chauffeur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little Ford Focus is killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to get you a better stereo in
there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the whole car is from 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not the car, it's what the
radio plays around here makes me want to
[SPEAKER_00]: stab my ears with fucking butter knives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear channels taking over the world and
I've been pushed back to FM recently and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been a tough transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I heard Taylor Swift,
Poison, Metallica, and I think it was some
[SPEAKER_00]: Bon Jovi on the way over here just as you
channel surfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were in the car for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got fucking bad people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God the digital age came along when
it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be so glad to get my car back and
then we'll get everything back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the people that have
helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of people that have
really given me some rides and shit for
[SPEAKER_00]: the past few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done me some favors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the people that have showed
up at my house with food because I hate
[SPEAKER_00]: eating food that I have at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cook the same shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of people that have
showed up with some fatty meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to be a home-bound vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because all my shit's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't stock the fridge for more than
three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can get a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a shit ton of bananas and apples
and I've been eating all kinds of goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so thanks to the people that
have helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap up the show.

[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a

[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a hardcore dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rost and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me use your music on
the show, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge thanks to Kat, Coop and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for joining me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do another news episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table from me is our
good news buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to share way too much right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got way too much information in this
opening story that I want to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overshare time, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: To you and to whoever else may be
listening, I'm going to drop down the
[SPEAKER_00]: music for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question to you guys, and I'm going
to... I shared a lot of my personal life
[SPEAKER_00]: on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about my use of medicated
personal lubricants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about what CBD does to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys ever noticed that you can
take a dab or even flowers do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but dabs have definitely made it happen
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever smoked a certain strain and
it made you have to poop right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: You went silent on me.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just... All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to give the question the thought
that I would a rational question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that occasionally there
will be a certain strain that'll come
[SPEAKER_00]: around and I'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost every time I dab it,
I will get the urge to poop right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a phenotype of deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was deadhead OG number two was the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I smoked it, bro, I would get
like, oh, I'm needing to fart right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know those specific cannabinoids that
have been found to really help with
[SPEAKER_01]: digestive issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could fully be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know which one it is, but you may
have stumbled into a strain that's high in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, something we dabbed tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to blame it on
because I was cool and then we took a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which dabs are you blaming this on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the change in the menu, the new
addition that we've been trying a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight is this headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I been dabbing the headband as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been dabbing the headband as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the weed then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit eating fucking black bean burgers,
you dirty hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to blame the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So listeners, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me, find me on Facebook,
do something, interact with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a certain strain that when you
smoke, it makes you have to poop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if this is just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go tweet that at Russ Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it to the at GFYH podcast on Twitter or
find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any ads for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: No sponsors this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: What month is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is June.
[SPEAKER_00]: No sponsors for the month of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to sponsor the show
starting in the month of July,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you all the information that you
need to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have your product featured on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of news.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a news filled episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ready for some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my first news article is going to
be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a good way to kick down the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about taking a poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can just get right to the news
after that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dive right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a small sip of some
beverage here and get my throat nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: clear before we get into this news here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, say something useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't quite a fair back and forth
with me and Jeff right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a laptop and a pile of notes and a
smartphone that's linked to the wifi and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have my memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to pass you this pile of hash
and a dabber and an email and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep the news and the show going and
you can just keep us nice and dabbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that beverage dislodged something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't even have done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that it's in my control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw down this Durban poison or the
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could dab you the more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So freaking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some Tora Bora, that's super high
CBD sap stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm going to go with the Tora.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can reach this bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until after we get done with the main news
article for today's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little sappier than what you're
used to, but you'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got some AJ's sour diesel and I
have got some- It's like honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, just more sour diesel and more
Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can tell what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Durban was quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the boys at Turpax.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Turpax boys and shout out to my
friends at Green and Healthy Wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Damsel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, John Randall Jr. Hope you're
doing well, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're playing some video games and
having a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey fellas, I saw the shop and I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Pueblo, Colorado,
I recommend the spot dispensary in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: West.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in Colorado Springs and
you're looking for good flowers and or
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, I definitely recommend that
you hit Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on 212 South Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty sure that's the address.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go there, buy stuff, support the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medical only shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot get in there without a medical
marijuana recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green and Healthy is medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spot is rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spot is recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can go to the spot if you're 21
and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can go to the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's paying me to say this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a great headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best headlines I've gotten to
read on the show in a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: finally admits cannabis kills cancer
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great news because now that
they're admitting it, maybe we can start
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalizing it and using it as
medicine all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't jump to conclusions, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A man can dream, can't he?
[SPEAKER_01]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent you this and this was one of the
highlights in my week was reading this
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I caught the journal article
that it talks about a few months back,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm glad to see it start to make the
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, that sound is parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: How large a dab would you like,
sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you eyeball out a 0.3 if I told you a
0.3?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I just saw why they call it
Shetta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tip of the dabber will chip the
shatter in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably say that's like 0.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice try.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the piece that came off nice and
smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should probably read the news article
I've teased you guys about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says a group of federal researchers
commissioned by the government to prove
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis has no accepted medical use
may have unwittingly let information slip
[SPEAKER_00]: through the cracks, revealing how cannabis
actually kills cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the beautiful thing about kind
of how we got here, just to step back for
[SPEAKER_01]: a second and do my obnoxious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great because I want to dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw you want it, so I grabbed the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis fanatics and supporters and
advocates don't get to do federal research
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researchers do and the feds have blocked
most research not looking for harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the studies we have showing how
safe cannabis is and what an effective
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine it is, most of those studies are
studies that were like, find out that it
[SPEAKER_01]: proves or that it causes lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that link.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the top researchers spends
a couple of years looking at cannabis use
[SPEAKER_01]: and lung function and finds out that it
doesn't cause cancer, that it increases
[SPEAKER_01]: lung function.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of those fun things about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recovered from my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, Phil, and thank you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it says, the research which was
conducted by a team of scientists at St.
[SPEAKER_00]: George's University of London found that
the two most common cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol,
which is THC, and cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is our favorite CBD, weakened the
ferocity of cancer cells and made them
[SPEAKER_00]: more susceptible to radiation treatment,
said Mike Adams of Herbal Dispatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main two cannabinoids in marijuana
they say marijuana a lot in this article,
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis weaken the ferocity of cancer
cells and make them more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is kicking cancer's ass is
what it's saying right there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Making it more- That's exactly what it's
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making it its bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not the first research study
to find exactly that, that something in
[SPEAKER_01]: the marijuana plant likely THC or CBD is
triggering what they call apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when a cell in your body is
supposed to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apoptosis happens and the cell dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's replaced by a new cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cancer, the cell doesn't die and grows out
of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis triggers the cell, tells it it's
time to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second federal medical marijuana
patient ever has been shouting this from
[SPEAKER_01]: the rooftops for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a URV?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's URV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to URV.
[SPEAKER_01]: URV and Rosenfeld, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't heard that name before,
Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read his book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: His story will blow your fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read more books, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets to smoke joints at a special room
in Disneyland, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took the US federal government to court
and said, cannabis is the best medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you, tell me otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And won in federal court and can smoke
joints anywhere, on the road, at work,
[SPEAKER_01]: across from the DEA headquarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the DEA headquarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a stockbroker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere you're allowed to consume
tobacco, he's allowed to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds ship him 11 ounces a month for
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: For free?
[SPEAKER_00]: For free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that URV and you couldn't pay me
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 11 ounces a month for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kept him alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be dead without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the world record holder for most
joints smoked in a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Snoop, but URV's record's
confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets the gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snoop's probably smoked the most blunts
and also post the most Instagram posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an award Snoop can win for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to read more of this
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the study, which was published
last year in the medical journal,
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecular Cancer Therapies, details the
dramatic reductions in fatal variations of
[SPEAKER_00]: brain cancer when these specific
cannabinoids were used in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't try it without radiation,
but it said it helped with radiation in
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marijuana can kill certain cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've shown that cannabinoids could play a
role in treating one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive cancers in adults, lead
researcher, Dr. Wei Li.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in November, 2014 op-ed for the
Washington Post, the results are
[SPEAKER_00]: promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could provide a way of breaking through
Guilloma tumors and saving more lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's a little sub headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says recent animal studies have shown
that marijuana can kill certain cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and reduce the size of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NIDA report said, evidence from one
animal study suggests that extracts from a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant marijuana can shrink one of
the most serious types of brain tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research in mice showed that these
extracts, when used with radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased the cancer killing effects of
the radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, NIDA's new found
pro-pot position is especially curious
[SPEAKER_00]: given that it was revealed on the heels of
a recent proposal introduced to both
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress and the House of Representative,
which attempts to legalize medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana on a national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill, which is called the Careers Act,
seeks to downgrade the schedule one status
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana to a schedule two in order to
make the herb more flexible in the eyes of
[SPEAKER_00]: the federal government as an acceptable
form of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the bill would also remove
cannabidiol, the non-intoxicating compound
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody finally said compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't call it a fucking ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see somebody finally get that
one right.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if they heard the podcast,
if somebody heard you call them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I used the word compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, they should say compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they are removing cannabidiol,
the non-intoxicating compound of the pot
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, from the Controlled Substances Act
to allow it to be distributed on a
[SPEAKER_00]: state-to-state basis without violating
federal statutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis became a schedule one drug in
1970 with the passing of the Controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: Substances Act, which classified cannabis
as having a high potential for abuse,
[SPEAKER_00]: no medical usage, and unsafe to use
without medical supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: This federal research basically
contradicts cannabis' schedule one status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could this mean reform is closer than we'd
originally imagined?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, is this the floodgate right here
for cannabis reform now that we have found
[SPEAKER_00]: out that it actually does kill cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that with absolutely no doubt
because the federal government holds a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent for cannabis as a neuroprotective.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal medical marijuana program is
as old as I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 32, 33 years old now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've known a lot of this for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't want to admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if they do admit it, do you think
that that's going to open the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical company floodgates to where
they want to make and patent cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as soon as it tips federally
legal, the pharma industry, the tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, everybody's going to try to jump
in it if they can or if they have a desire
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still that big, it's immoral.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think any of the, if you put
big and then capitalize the name of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, I don't think they're going to
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tobacco industry is not moral.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing you anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they've got one more product,
they can sell you because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lose cigarettes and smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to do right after we get
stoned?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you want to do is smoke a
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they'll have two products to sell
you and you're going to be buying them all
[SPEAKER_00]: day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think that, who is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds are those
cigarette companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: The two rings a bell in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you got two, you pulled two names,
correct names.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alpha brain, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to attribute that to alpha
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think- Attribute that shit to
advertising, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think those guys are lined up?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like fucking- Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at the football team at the
scrimmage line, ready to run as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: someone says hike, they're going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definite evidence that different
tobacco companies are definitely looking
[SPEAKER_01]: into marijuana legalization and have been
since the seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we got really close in the
seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody seems to remember this,
but Jimmy Carter almost was the president
[SPEAKER_01]: who legalized it, almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed up late.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wasn't there for that either,
but it's part of the history.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, where the fuck were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dabbed out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you look at your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You looked at your fingernails,
like I'm not sure what I'm saying right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they have found out that cannabis
will kill cancer cells and we're worried
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's going to go to the
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tobacco is going to jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, the tobacco companies have been
looking at it in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the fuck I was going.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But never seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some serious problems with,
like a lot of people just assume,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, well all Marlboro has to do is plant
huge fields of sour diesel and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: can put out cartons of Marlboro's.
[SPEAKER_01]: A, it doesn't grow like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: B, it doesn't dry like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: C, it doesn't cure like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: D, it doesn't roll through the same
machines as tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they would literally have to build
the whole infrastructure up from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't just convert their existing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that hurdle for everybody on
top of which Colorado Dixie elixirs is
[SPEAKER_01]: already, I mean, they're already done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that infrastructure is already built.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point Marlboro has to catch up
to Dixie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some pharma companies in Great
Britain that are light years ahead of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the industry, but that's because
Great Britain has much better research
[SPEAKER_01]: rules than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, I used to see on like
Facebook and shit used to see pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: Marlboro having weed packages already
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think, or is that with just some
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a, it's just a Photoshop mockup.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a company out of Colorado that
was attempting to put together a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes filled with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they were to the marketing to
dispensary stage the last time I heard
[SPEAKER_01]: about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're, if they were to
go fund me stage and the guy was over
[SPEAKER_01]: pitching it at the restaurant or what,
but I've heard they're on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go to shops enough to know.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I guess I do go to a shop often
because I work in one, but I don't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see any green and healthy
wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's jump out of this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to cannabinoids and fuck you
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I want to wrap up that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it is written by our good
friend, Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article kind of sparked some
controversy and we'll get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: controversy right after.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is, is this central Denver's
first 420 friendly hotel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sub headline is smoke, vape and edibles on
the balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good at native hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver's a downtown Denver's first
outwardly 420 friendly hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says many in Colorado's bustling
cannabis industry have complained about
[SPEAKER_00]: the lack of marijuana friendly hotels in
this state and others, but it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can buy cannabis on every corner in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drive down federal, if you drive
down Broadway, if you go down Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Boulevard, it's, I mean, in some areas
it's more than every corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shout out green mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little, little a broadster dam there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Starbucks and then a car
dealership and then a fucking dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what else is there up there in
Denver?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little art studio, a little art studio
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's all about a tattoo shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, was what was on my brain at
fucking tattoo store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are all these places to buy
cannabis, but the only place to smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: legally is at your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just drove from Texas,
you- You ain't got no home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine having, you just drove how
many hours from Texas, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get here, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit the dispensary, your mind's blown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get out to the parking lot and- You're
not going to wait 10 to 14 hours to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: home and smoke that first Colorado bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different special crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even do that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go, you've got to find
accommodations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, how many Airbnb places are in
Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a place to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big, this is a need that needs
filling people.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the next line here says,
but Keith Cola partner, Richmond Meyer is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually doing something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's opening native hotel this week in
downtown Denver, boasting that half of its
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 rooms have weed friendly balconies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it right, every hotel has a weed
friendly balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my issue with the balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a tourist, you're new.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to stick you on the balcony
and give you crazy good weed at altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're setting you up for a- How many
different ways can we set ourselves up for
[SPEAKER_01]: failure in this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: We like, we can't bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're incredibly popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're essentially giant buildings full
of weed and money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what jackass with a big gun and a
tiny dick doesn't want a big building full
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed and money to rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still somehow like the robbery rates
lower than seven 11s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen the security guards at the
spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: True, but they ain't there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was a, I saw Mark Emery's post
from yesterday on Facebook, one of his
[SPEAKER_01]: friend's dispensaries in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody drove a truck through the front
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They apprehended the guy in a different
dispensary doing the same shit a second
[SPEAKER_01]: time in a night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a, what a fun place Vancouver must
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I mean, how many different ways
can we set ourselves up for failure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the last thing you want is a newbie
from Texas on Edibles on a balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: My high ass on a balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drop the pipe right off that
son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heads up mother ship coming down for a
landing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year we were at a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say the name of the
hotel, but it's a popular hotel in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a dabber, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had all the rooms full in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this whole hallway was all dab kids
from the cannabis industry and upstairs
[SPEAKER_00]: was all dab kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody was like, Hey bro,
you got any butane?
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one guy up above goes, I got a can
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy goes, drop it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody got quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see two arms go over the balcony and
he goes scoot over and the guy scooted
[SPEAKER_00]: over and he dropped the can of butane and
that shit landed right in the dude below
[SPEAKER_00]: him's hand, below his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a random bout.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of these Texas stoners or
Nebraska stoners, that just took their
[SPEAKER_00]: first dab in a hotel are not going to be
able to catch or deal with the balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ground level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even need stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The need for consumption clubs and
cannabis friendly hotel accommodations is
[SPEAKER_01]: massive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to jump out of the article
and just kind of rant on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was headed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have a, and I'm not trying to
bash on the hotel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sound like I'm snitching on the hotel
and talking shit, but why can we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis friendly hotel, but we cannot?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fighting with that mic dab rig,
email combo so hard to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get an award.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have this hotel, but we cannot
have the smokers clubs that were in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: POTUS got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: POTUS was where everybody used to be able
to go and dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another speakeasy that I
recently went to and spoke of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recently got told that they couldn't
smoke in there anymore or they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grassroots break room got shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the smoking clubs, Mike's
telling me to kill his mic because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cough it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and it got the echo reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these smoking clubs have been shut
down, but we can have a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike has given me a thumbs up that I could
put his mic back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recoveredish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should see the size dab mic takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dabs for ants and he chokes like a
champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tobacco kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys quit smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get healthy, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run some laps, spit that shit out and get
off the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting too old for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tobacco kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some reasons to live now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while some downtown Denver hotels
quietly allow marijuana-friendly tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: tour operators to book vape-friendly
rooms, Native will be central Denver's
[SPEAKER_00]: first outwardly friendly hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The charm of Native Hotel is that the
owners are in the business, said Meyer,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is an owner, partner, and investor in
a number of cannabis-related ventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a sick answer to the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck finding it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my other business card.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way better answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you what else I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a hotel right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, so we could pretty much just go rent
the hotel for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to pay for the whole
night and shit, but then it'd just be a
[SPEAKER_00]: spot to go chill and dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little expensive unless you're
doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have a ballroom?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they got plenty of ballroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We embrace the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We embrace the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We embrace the plant and everything that's
coming along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your terpenes and your CBD,
and it's used to make alixirs for
[SPEAKER_00]: different situations, like hangover
drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that hemp juice they sell on the
net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, since it's CBD, they can sell it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's not THC, it qualifies as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how they're getting away with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're allowed to grow hemp in most
industrialized nations, and they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: squeezing CBD out of it since it hit
Sanjay Gupta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was going to complain that it
didn't Senate Bill 1084 shut down the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to serve a medicated concoction on
your premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they found a way around it,
dude, by... It's not really medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hep C juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Meyer, who owns the 420 Friendly Hotel
and is a partner at Keef Cola,
[SPEAKER_00]: also plays a role in licensing company
Cancor Concepts, extraction equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer Isolate Extraction Systems,
Hemp Company, Native Hemp Corp,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the American Trade Association for
Cannabis and Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of Meyer's many industrial
hats, Native will still feel like a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard high-end boutique hotel,
he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the many, many entrepreneurs
that have sprung up just outside to help
[SPEAKER_01]: support our wonderful industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a reason to protect that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncle Sam won't take your shit for working
with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take it if you are us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a good thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want your tax money like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people in my life that have lobbied
me to be him rather than to be me,
[SPEAKER_01]: expensively, for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon, Mike is going to teach you
guys how to become a lobbyist or how to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in the ground floor of doing medical
marijuana activism or recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis activism or cannabis legalization
activism, whatever you're into,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is going to do a little lesson on how
to get into that pretty soon for us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably two or three episodes away from
that, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to get involved, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys seem intimidated, but it's not
that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's got this hotel and you can
smoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes on to say, we're not going to
be hanging green crosses everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: added Meyer, who said he funded Native
with money he made in the financial
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there's this big cannabis
tourism movement and we want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: embrace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cannabis friendly rooms because
they have balconies.
[SPEAKER_01]: 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just out of curiosity, do you remember the
number of people that came in for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more than 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when this thing works, we need about
3,500 other people to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Lodo.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, all over Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, just for the cannabis cup,
come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need one on Pueblo West right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a cannabis Marriott.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hotel in Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first one in Denver is the
only reason it's really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one in Manitou, it's not, you can't
smoke in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a smoking tent and then they
have a sub smoking tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have the cigarette tent and then
right next to it is the cannabis tent with
[SPEAKER_00]: like chairs and shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is 420 friendly in there,
but you can't smoke out and dab out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to lay in the bed and watch
cartoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked weed and plenty of hotel
parking lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this one special?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Meyers said he's been kicked out of
hotels in Denver for smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of his room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other hotels will find you crazy amounts
and kick you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I've been kicked out at a hotel
in Denver for smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mid tier smaller hotel and it was
a few years back, but that's the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I don't want to happen in our hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meyers said he's working on some affinity
partnerships with local recreational pot
[SPEAKER_00]: shops and other related businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show your native hotel room key and get a
discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says pro tip recreational shop,
Loto wellness is right across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for stocking his rooms, mini bars with
branded rolling papers, glass pipes and
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff in his team aren't quite there
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that word in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good word to learn now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to double and triple check
everything so we're not putting our
[SPEAKER_00]: business at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meyers said it's a hotel, a club and a
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of alcohol related point
of sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're keeping the cannabis to the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a big thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to keep the cannabis
and the alcohol separate because the
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol- They're not allowed to let you
gather.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really bizarre part of the law
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most places don't allow any sort of
gathering to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get all kinds of touchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be private.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invite only, private property,
close to the public, secured security.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the shit the symphony had to go
through just so that people could get
[SPEAKER_01]: baked and then go listen to the symphony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tried to shut that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really set the path for the rules for
doing this, which is kind of awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way to go Colorado Symphony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who thought they were going to be the
trailblazer, but they stepped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's enough news, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, thanks for coming and doing another
new show with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start putting together your little episode
about how to get these people into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are a few people that are
out there listening right now that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a cannabis activist and they don't know
how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start writing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me like 15 or 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you heard him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just gave us his word, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to do that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to start thinking about what you can
do for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this show is going to come out on a
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back on Monday with another
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up, I don't know that it'll be the
next episode, but coming up pretty soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will do an episode about phenohunting
and mother plants, how to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: your mother plants, how to select a good
mother plant from the phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've done a little bit of it,
but I'm going to do a nice focused episode
[SPEAKER_00]: on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's going to do his show about getting
us into politics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's getting involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it'll be called.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much getting you into politics
or getting you into lobbying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you got to get involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get involved now,
we're going to be stuck in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: dimerish loop forever, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to make stupid rules around
us that we didn't even pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: them making, and they're going to pass it
because nobody knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your whole country is going to be
stuck with fucking CBD only medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: because we weren't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big anti-pot groups going
around the country right now is now
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying for CBD only nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if that rule goes in federally,
they get their perfect excuse for stamping
[SPEAKER_01]: out all of the medical access we've
created since 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to say again, well, the feds are
allowing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else gets to have it except through
A, B, and C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get to shut down everything coast
to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the excuse they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it once already in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that on a future,
on the episode when you tell us how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get involved, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I'll be back Monday with another
full-on episode, probably something more
[SPEAKER_00]: in depth, more less newsy, probably be
just myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get Kingkola and maybe
Jesse back over for some more shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those boys are busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's outdoor season, so Jesse is kicking
it with the outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be back on the podcast sometime
after Christmas, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get them over here and do some
outdoor growing episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sean agreed to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company is going
to maybe jump back on sponsorship and if
[SPEAKER_00]: not the Rocky Mountain Worm Company,
it will be Rocky Mountain Organic Farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Sean's company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he will come do a lot of speaking once
he becomes an official sponsor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for listening again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in sponsoring the
podcast or if you have a product you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like me to review, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you all the information you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I would have a lot of fun sitting
here testing out whatever product you sent
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some stuff to product test,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that nail we were checking out
that a friend of ours had?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the name of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the Torchless?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was called the Torchless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to review one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim, if you're listening to the show,
bro, sometimes you listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like you to send me a Torchless
nail to review on the show and we will
[SPEAKER_00]: review it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Torchless nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe you can become a sponsor or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we'll pay for the nail if
we like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't like it, I will send it
right back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else do we need as a sponsor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the Pella nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that make the cases with the
email built into the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we need those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to test out one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabidoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dabidoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what the Dabidoo is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another electronic nail company I've been
seeing online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good sales from media stuff from
them or stuff that's got my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is reached by over 10,000 people
on every episode within the first 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of being posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's some local glass blowers
that could use a little prop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, if you want to
sponsor the show, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to be advertised on a
podcast that reaches 10,000 pot smokers
[SPEAKER_00]: within 24 hours, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now that the show is over,
guys, make sure you go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for a girl from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a five-star rating, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Jedi mind tricking you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear it?

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, after you give me five stars,
type in a little comment and let me know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will read your comment on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read every comment that's on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher completely sucks for comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's hard to leave a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They change Stitcher constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can leave a comment on there,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always leave some comments on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave little comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get 140 characters, but you can

not into the social media thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely email me.

[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that every show is available
on iTunes, Stitcher, and all the episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: are forever archived on iRegion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging, but I would appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is always going to be free,
but if you want to throw down,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on all the social media sites,
like I said.
