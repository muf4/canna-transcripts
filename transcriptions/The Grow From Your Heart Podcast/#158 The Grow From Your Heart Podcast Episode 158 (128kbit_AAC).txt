[SPEAKER_03]: Huge thank you shout out to my friends in
the Mystic Roots band for letting me use
[SPEAKER_03]: their music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, across the table for
me once again is our buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you recovered from that dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not quite so purple anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I caught a comma breath doing good.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friends at TR
Concentrate, smoking on some Stardog
[SPEAKER_03]: Shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the dab that you just gave me a dab
of?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Candy Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Botanico's Live Resin Candy Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to those guys as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanico does a hell of a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about 200 milligrams deep on some
edibles right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been taking plenty of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to bring you an amazing
podcast, I promise you.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
an email that I was sent a friend of ours
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll verify that in the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is awaiting and anticipating the
legalization of cannabis in his area,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he wants to be properly prepared,
and he wants to know how to get a jump on
[SPEAKER_03]: things, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a legislation question lined up
for Mike, and then he's got a grow
[SPEAKER_03]: question lined up for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll probably take up most of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also going to read a Facebook post
from somebody in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also hope to get to an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with that one because it'll be
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope to get to an email, a message that
we received from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll probably start with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get that far, hey, Mike,
let everybody on that's listening,
[SPEAKER_03]: let everybody know how they can stalk you
on social media so that they can check you
[SPEAKER_03]: out while they're listening to your
handsome voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Twitter at Nemopunk15
or on Facebook, Pueblo for Sensible
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you support Pueblo for Sensible
Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, he posts a lot of great stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a like.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see something you like,
give us a share.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Help us build the cannabis army.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got pumped when you said you had an
email that specifically requested you and
[SPEAKER_02]: me to answer some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be an awesome question
for anybody who's states moving forward
[SPEAKER_02]: with their marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: They called you white Mike specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I needed you for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you're going to want to listen
to this, especially if you're in Michigan,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also if your state's just looking to
go medical or even recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everywhere that is getting ready or has
not yet, this could be informative for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of listeners I'm betting
that could use the information we're about
[SPEAKER_02]: to cover today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get there, I want to talk about
the breeding project that I keep telling
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am making, I've got an Arise mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't been updated yet,
if you don't listen to the show regularly,
[SPEAKER_03]: I am breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's breeding cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some breeding cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not goats or children.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't been listening,
let's catch you all the way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not breeding piranha.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm breeding cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made the Arise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arise is a strain that I made.
[SPEAKER_03]: It recently tested at 31% THCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a cross of golden goat and
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a regular seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not feminized.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just tested 31% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I searched through about a hundred seeds,
maybe more than a hundred to find the male
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a really killer male.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have also got a few phenotypes of
females of the same strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all in a room together.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male has been removed.
[SPEAKER_03]: His pollen did its thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male has been pulled out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a lemon skunk plant in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a golden goat plant in there for
experimental reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a grateful dog plant in there
because I wanted to make the Arise cross
[SPEAKER_03]: to grateful dog because those are my two
flagship that I'm known for right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of a lot of people's favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will not be any retail grateful dog
to Arise seeds for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a very small batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the beginning of the project,
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Arise, however, I just made F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Arise male hit the Arise females and I
made F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: By hitting multiple phenotypes of the
females, I have made a nice option for
[SPEAKER_03]: selection for variation for my F3s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get to see what that plant expresses
in a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be able to pick a very good male and
a very good female to make the F3.
[SPEAKER_03]: My goal is to take this to F5.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying not to rush it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go through and find the exact
plants I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more time and the more plants is sort
of the better is the rule of thumb in
[SPEAKER_02]: these projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know my encouragement is to go slow
and as big as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Selection is key when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that if I hit multiple females
with one male and then I pull seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: and I keep them separate and then I find
that golden male, I don't have to use,
[SPEAKER_03]: say I've got the females are labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they actually are is there's number
four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the keepers, the ones that are going
to survive to another run are four,
[SPEAKER_03]: eight and one that was lettered E from a
previous run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the three that are amazing
phenotypes of Arise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so those are your ladies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those will stick around for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the i3, the iRE3.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those will stick around for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male I call him Solomon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Arise.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: His name is Solomon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that I'll see diversity and I may
pick a male from number three or E and
[SPEAKER_03]: then I may pick a female from number four
and I may breed that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still the same phenyl generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm still making F3s, but it gives me a
lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the next run you're going to have a lot
more options than you would have otherwise
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're going as big as you are
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying to narrow it down to where
it almost looks like clones when you grow
[SPEAKER_03]: these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I get to F5, I want to be able
to say, yeah, it's going to look like this
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's basically a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I'm taking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listeners, if you're not quite as nerdy
as we are, the long and the short of what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're getting at here, the goal of all of
this is to find the best of the best of
[SPEAKER_02]: the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what that takes is a lot of
trial and error and a lot of willingness
[SPEAKER_02]: to kill off plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And towards the end or at the end,
the goal is you'll be able to put a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: pack of seeds in the ground and have all
of them come up very, very, very similar,
[SPEAKER_02]: very stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you're looking for for a
market ready product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not often what you get when
you're buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say that that's fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what is available and even a lot
of what I am making and what is available
[SPEAKER_03]: for myself are F1s, which means that they
have not been F2, which means they have
[SPEAKER_03]: not been stabilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a male of one strain and a female
of another, and I put pollen on it and it
[SPEAKER_03]: made seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tested them plenty before they were
released.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of seed companies that do
that, but that's what a lot of my stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But guys like DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the market standard right there,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of, yeah, that's how Gage
Green Genetics does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sort of how Sunkool does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why I always shake my head at a
10 pack that's one of each strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like how Greenhouse will sell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've seen it from a number of the
major companies where you'll get it in one
[SPEAKER_02]: form or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it as 10 little plastic baggie
stapled together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, I get one seed of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just trial and error with
germination alone makes that silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you know, as much as we do about
like phenotypical expression and plant
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilization and that this is likely an
F1 or maybe if I'm lucky in F2,
[SPEAKER_02]: like God only knows what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I've only got one seed,
I'll make sure it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've seen people bank on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lemon skunk that I have, my lemon skunk
that I have came as a gift seed from
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody else and I got one of them and it
was a gift from somebody else and they got
[SPEAKER_03]: it from Greenhouse seeds and they got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown a few killer one-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my day as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one that I kept that I have is
what I have bred the Lemon Jeffrey and
[SPEAKER_03]: Cascade from.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of your first big breeding projects
had a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can never remember if it was the
bubblegum or the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best stuff I've smoked to this
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just the one-off that we
couldn't find again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes if I don't like the way stuff
grows or whatever, I just don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it grew atrociously,
but the flavor of it was just so up my
[SPEAKER_02]: alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the way it did its thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't like the way a plant grows,
I'll just get rid of it because like we're
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, I've got so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not just run more seeds to replace
that and have the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want something that does.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can find a 10, you don't want a
bunch of sevens around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the breeding project I am speaking of
is approximately 62-ish days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow will be the start of week 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 63 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nine weeks in, which means it's just
about done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've taken out three, I've taken out four
seeds now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fourth seed looked completely ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm letting it ripen up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then tomorrow is Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully if I get all of my work done at
a reasonable hour by the end of Monday,
[SPEAKER_03]: I may go in there and start chopping down
plants of the new Arise F2 project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a small run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't take me a lot of trimming.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I'll do it is I'm going to cut
down one plant and then- These are the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones I saw a week ago, a few days ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty small plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll cut them down, take off all the
big leaves, hang them upside down,
[SPEAKER_03]: let them dry until they're fairly crispy,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just cut off a branch,
hold it over either a Tupperware dish or a
[SPEAKER_03]: pie plate and crumble it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like you're going to roll up old
school weed and just crunch it up and let
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds fall out and then pull out the
seeds, pull out the material.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may roll some joints with the dried
material, but then a lot of it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get turned into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have some VHO coming up here in just
a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I'll set the seeds aside,
let them dry out real well, get them nice
[SPEAKER_03]: and hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I will put them into little
packages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get some packages from
lecontainers.com and then get those lined
[SPEAKER_03]: up, get a few of them into some packages
and get them out to my friends that test
[SPEAKER_03]: them out for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I will grow a shit ton of them
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will see if the Arise F2s are worth
growing, worth making more of,
[SPEAKER_03]: or if I selected the wrong male,
then I'll go back and find another boy of
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit and try again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since I've used multiple females,
I'll keep all the females separate,
[SPEAKER_03]: keep the seeds separated, and I will run
comparisons of batch A, batch B,
[SPEAKER_03]: batch C, and I will see which ones I like
better so that I could find my breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a lot of research and a
lot of work and a lot of looking before I
[SPEAKER_03]: even continue, before I even think about
making an F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to really see what the F,
or before I make an F3, I want to see what
[SPEAKER_03]: the F2s really, really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's almost time to take those down,
probably tomorrow night when I get done
[SPEAKER_03]: doing all my work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll let you guys know how they grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about that on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyone that's been- Yeah, I'm looking
forward to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't tell, I've been talking about
it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk about one more thing
before we get into some of the main
[SPEAKER_03]: topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me go way far back.
[SPEAKER_03]: About a year and a half ago, we're coming
up on two years almost, a year and three
[SPEAKER_03]: quarters ago, I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit the fuck out of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long story short, I hit my head on a low
doorway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 6'5", the doorway was probably 6'3".
[SPEAKER_03]: I was walking fast enough to where when I
hit the top of my head on this doorway,
[SPEAKER_03]: it knocked me clean the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was walking to some stairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit my head, knocked myself out,
completely unconscious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went spaghetti and fell down the stairs
while I was completely unconscious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to have a couple of friends wake me
up, carry me up the stairs, get me in a
[SPEAKER_03]: chair, try to get my shit back together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was broken, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some serious problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: My vision was not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain was not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: My word association wasn't happening
properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: My names, I couldn't remember people's
names.
[SPEAKER_03]: My best friends would be sitting at the
table and I couldn't tell you what the
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck their names were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was broken.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was having problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was having physical problems related to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My body would not regulate its
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was winter time and I was running
around in just a t-shirt and everyone's in
[SPEAKER_03]: coats and shit and they're looking at me
like, do what kind of drugs are you on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, head injury, no drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just fucking sweaty all the time now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would not stop being overheated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But something that was also funky was my
vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: My vision would get wobbly sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I would watch certain animated shit or
certain TV shows filmed a certain way,
[SPEAKER_03]: my vision would get weird and I just have
to quit watching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain video games would fuck with my
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really play video games,
but if I watch other people play,
[SPEAKER_03]: some games would mess with my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's really messed with me for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was having dizzy spells a little while
for a little while, but everything's
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much back to normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm back on track from all that
until I recorded that episode at Elevate a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys listen to the podcast,
I went to Elevate and recorded a show.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a rig there by an artist named
Matt Cameron.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I call him Matt Cameron?
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the social media post about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: His name's Cameron Reed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me correct myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Matt Cameron is a drummer that I
watched a video from the other day,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the dude's name is Cameron Reed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameron Reed Glass on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude made a rig and the work is
called redicello or ready work is what
[SPEAKER_03]: they call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just clear glass with white lines
through it and it's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw this rig and when I stared at the
rig, it started moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had kind of a Christmas ornament.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glass kind of quality to it if that helps
describe it for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's trippy to my brain, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes my brain do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I look at it, it looks like it's
moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those lines look like they're
spinning around like Tron.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I stared at it, everybody kind of
looked at me like I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, you got to quit looking at
that because you're the only one seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, I'm going to walk away
from this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I posted on Facebook basically my
experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fell in love with this rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you guys this rig is... I
looked at the price tag from underneath
[SPEAKER_03]: because the price tag is on the bottom and
the shelf it's sitting on is glass so I
[SPEAKER_03]: could see through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either $2,100 or $2,400.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't read if that was a one or a
four.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not in my budget to spend on a
glass rig to tell you the damn truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be awesome to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just stare at it and take dabs out
of it and then stare at it some more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned this on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted up to Facebook and to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much told the same story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: My eyes were fucked up and then I saw this
rig and I was mesmerized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'm in love with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted a picture of the rig and the
artist that made the rig contacted me and
[SPEAKER_03]: sent me a sweet pendant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent me a disc pendant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bigger than a silver dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a little bit bigger than a
silver dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bigger than a silver
dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some great ready work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got an opal in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always forgot the name of the opals.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got an opal in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wore it on a chain to the secret sesh
the other night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody told me how dope my pendant was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys with blue eyes, all of my friends
with blue eyes and blonde hair or close to
[SPEAKER_03]: the ginger side of life, all of them would
look at it and they would make the same
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking mesmerized face that I make.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something with blue eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine, she does eye stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always say the name of her career wrong,
but she does eye stuff and she's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, I could teach you why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, I don't want to learn
about my eyes because if you tell me what
[SPEAKER_03]: my eyes are doing, I'll start feeling it
and it'll fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say eye stuff, are we talking
like American Medical Association
[SPEAKER_02]: certified ophthalmologist?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking like blow sage smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, she works at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wears scrubs and goes to an eye place
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know both types of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're definitely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eye stuff, isn't it real clear?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got friends that could fucking rub some
Nag Champa on your face and tell you
you're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me which crystal you carry to keep my
body focused for fucking me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: She works with a very well-known doctor
here in the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just double checking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, she's professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's bad at what she does.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell she's good at it because she
comes home and you can tell that she's
[SPEAKER_03]: proud of what she did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that there's a style of art that
only mesmerizes gingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend knows why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or blondes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she can explain why.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something with the rods and cones and
my blue eyes that do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameron Reed Glass, dude, thank you for
the sweet pendant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was dope as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does move.
[SPEAKER_03]: It spins around just like that rig that
you made, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I hold it still in the palm of my hand,
it looks like it's fucking spinning and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you hear this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope somebody tags you or tells you to
listen to this podcast somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, shout out to all my friends at
Elevate Glass because that's where I saw
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you guys follow Cameron Reed
Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He makes sweet glass and he's a cool ass
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a cool fucking gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open up the mailbox one day and find this
cool ass pendant.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my friends loved it too at the secret
sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dopest pin at the sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the main topic of this
podcast now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of screenshots here
because I like to screenshot the messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it much easier for me to find
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a really quick message.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one came from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, I don't say the names,
but this dude, he's from North Carolina
[SPEAKER_03]: and his name is Carolina Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So follow him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to get this episode out
to you as soon as we can because you need
[SPEAKER_03]: this information pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You say only a few weeks left of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do anything in a bottle,
so you're looking for like around the
[SPEAKER_02]: house style?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the grower in me says- Where's
Jesse when we need him?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse is on the coast right now having a
good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Jesse's in Portland is where I
think he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashtag earned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He cut off his ponytail.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks so handsome now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got himself cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike nailed what I thought most people
would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to use some guanos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to want to use some alfalfa
meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to want to use something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've only got a couple of weeks
left, so you don't want to pump a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of stuff into the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of those organic products are
going to take at least two weeks to four
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks to closer to six or eight weeks to
even break down and be available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, it sounds like you
missed your shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some good news though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature-wise, the plant's supposed to have
used up most of what's around it by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as intended.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are a couple of things that you
can do if you don't want to go by bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've only got a few weeks left,
so keep in mind that you're going to want
[SPEAKER_03]: to flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even outdoors, you need to flush your
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a time period where they're not
receiving any nutrients so that they can
[SPEAKER_03]: start to get rid of the shit that's stored
up in them so that your buds burn and
[SPEAKER_03]: taste and smell perfectly at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give yourself hopefully 10 to 14,
maybe 15 to 16, maybe 20 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to flush for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you haven't been feeding up to
this point either, you don't want to hit
[SPEAKER_02]: them with too much now, you'll shock the
hell out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he knows they're probably hungry
for something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he hasn't boosted them up,
they probably are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I would recommend, if you want to
feed them something, like I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: some guanos would be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stuff like that would be cool,
but some comfrey would be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe make up a nice tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably your best bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tea with some worm castings,
some alfalfa meal in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe put a little tiny bit of molasses in
there just to keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then any sort of kelp meal or
something, make a tea out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just coming to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to go as smoothly as I can
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe put some, I'm not sure what all you
are willing to use either, but kelp meal
[SPEAKER_03]: would definitely help you get some bulk
and some flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe put some fish hydrosolates in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would help you out with some
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, if you make a tea like this,
brew it up for just a couple of few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you need instructions on making a
tea, send me an email and we'll try to get
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse on here to help us with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll answer you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sent me this message on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So send me a message on Instagram and
hopefully I can run you through making a
[SPEAKER_03]: tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But make a tea, feed the plants the tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't make a tea, then some basic
fish hydrosolates in a bottle would work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pour that, put some water into a five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a little more than what the label says
a fish hydrosolates in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mix it up real well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put some molasses in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mix that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe some kelp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any sort of kelp product that you can put
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Liquid kelp would be more available,
but that's a bottled product.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want to do that, I think a
tea would be your best way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse and I have done episodes about
making teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a thing that's available.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want to search for that,
send me a message.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll either find it for you or I will
reply to you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just doing the math in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this show doesn't come out immediately,
he's only got three weeks from when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: recording it at most of grow time left.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he's on the East coast, if I've got my
numbers right in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our friends in Colorado are
actually harvesting this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to people higher up in elevation
than we are down here in Pueblo that are a
[SPEAKER_02]: little further up into the foothills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvest began last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dipping below 50 at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went to two different grows,
one that was about 700 feet higher up in
[SPEAKER_02]: elevation than the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the higher one first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buds were almost done.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to give them three more
days at harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drove down the road a few hundred feet
and Buds were three weeks from harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit closer to the sun and
which side of the mountain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our side.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we East to the Rockies?
[SPEAKER_03]: We both had to think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mountains are West and so I had to
quickly... I know which direction I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are like, how do you always know
where you're going?
[SPEAKER_03]: The mountains are right over there all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've been in Colorado one year,
you know how to get to wherever you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going because of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since Mike was talking for a second,
I got a chance to write this down.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need to make a tea, get yourself a
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a clean bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to Lowe's, pay a couple bucks,
get a clean bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the hydro store or the fish store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get an air pump that pumps out quite a bit
of air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself one of those air stones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the air stone in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill the bucket with water.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can, put the air stone in there and
get that air stone pumping that water with
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of oxygen for 24 hours before you do
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your goal here is to get the chlorine out
of that water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the chlorine out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next day, add some warm castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Add some alfalfa sprouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Add some kelp meal and add a little tiny
bit of molasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let that bubble for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to get foamy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Expect it to get foamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will foam up like a beer and go
everywhere if you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may or may not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on your witch's brew.
[SPEAKER_03]: The proteins in the fish hydrosalates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't write fish hydrosalates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put fish hydrosalates in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The proteins in the fish hydrosalates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I helped the guy shampoo the smell out of
his carpet one time, so just fair warning
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful what your witch's brew does the
first time you make it, because sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: it foams up like a song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would recommend, this will make
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you use this five gallon bucket,
you could probably cut this in half,
[SPEAKER_03]: or if you're going outdoor, you can just
pour the whole five gallon bucket on there
[SPEAKER_03]: if you want to, but it's getting toward
the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to go huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill it with water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the bubble in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble it long enough to get the chlorine
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you pour in the fish hydrosalates,
warm castings, alfalfa sprouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the right one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what I want to use?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelp meal and molasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pour those things in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are more things that you could use.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use crab meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use bone meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use fish meal if you want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are not all necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let that shit stew around, and that
bubbles for 12 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to make a bunch of foam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it in the garage if you have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it somewhere where it's easy to clean
up, where you're not worried about a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of foam.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it does not foam up, that does not mean
it's bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it bubble up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then go outside and pour it on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not on the plants, near the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water your plants with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go near the stalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go out because your roots that eat the
most and drink the most are the ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: are on the outer perimeter of the plant,
not right there at the stalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: The part of the stalk is always going to
have some moisture down there at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on the outer edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where your growing roots are,
and the plants are reaching out for stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go out there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your best bet is to make a tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water with this tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then hopefully you'll see a little bit of
boost in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fish hydrosalates are going to give
you a little bit of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The warm castings are going to give you
microbes, and it's going to help
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The warm castings will provide a little
tiny bit of nitrogen, but they'll also
[SPEAKER_03]: speed everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The alfalfa meal is going to give you
nitrogen that's readily available.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kelp meal, I just think that that
makes everything stink.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it smell better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it taste better, and it adds to
density.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I talk to organic growers,
one of the first things that comes up is
[SPEAKER_02]: kelp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ocean products are always going to
make your stuff taste better, in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then molasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Molasses will actually feed all of the
worm casting microbes, and it will also
[SPEAKER_03]: feed your plants a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you can do outdoors,
but also keep in mind, bro, it's time to
[SPEAKER_03]: start flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right at the end of your clock,
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry we didn't get this question sooner
and out to you sooner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not blaming anything on Jesse,
but man, Jesse was busy as shit this year,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we didn't do many outdoor episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse, next year, you know, Jesse,
let's just sit down and record a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: season of outdoor shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get him once and do 11 episodes in one
long day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's hard to nail down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came by the other day and smoked me
down with some distillate that his
[SPEAKER_03]: company's making, and it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time I saw him in person,
I asked him, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went on for like 45 minutes about
projects he's currently working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's usually one of the three
busiest people I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friend, Carolina Cannabis
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you guys follow him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out his beautiful cannabis growing
skills and photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dude, thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to send me more messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see how your grow comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know if I answered your question
in the way you needed to answer it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else that has a message,
please send it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be easiest if you initiate a
conversation by sending me an email to
[SPEAKER_03]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're already corresponding on another
social media platform, keep it going.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easiest just to keep one conversation
happening because if you jump to another
[SPEAKER_03]: platform, I'm going to fucking get
confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're new, go to
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best way to get in touch with
me and I'll get your questions on an
[SPEAKER_03]: upcoming episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get through the questions
quickly because I know some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: questions are urgent because you got
plants growing or need shit to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to get on it, trying to do
more episodes for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got another thing I want to read
before I get to the basement and
[SPEAKER_03]: legislation question that I've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw something on Facebook the other day
and I thought it was very entertaining
[SPEAKER_03]: right after I did an episode about trim
machines.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a recent episode, we talked about trim
machines and I kind of bashed the shit out
[SPEAKER_03]: of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said, which trim machine to buy?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, don't buy a bunch of fucking
scissors and get your friends over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically what I told them because
that's really what I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody on Facebook, I don't know if
he wants to be named or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's known as Sodapop.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, upcoming Croptober helpful hints.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we call it Croptober.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: October is Croptober in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody needs a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody has to get some shit trimmed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every California, the whole coast,
but okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen trimmigrant memes recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a thing in lots of places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trimmigrants are coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So helpful Croptober or upcoming Croptober
helpful hints.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this dude says, number one,
if you want to process your trim into
[SPEAKER_03]: quality meds, please do not use a machine
trimmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oils from machine and the beaten trim lead
to unsightly slabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's saying that there's oils actually
in the trim machine, on the blades of the
[SPEAKER_03]: trim machine, on the metal parts of the
trim machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit's got to be lubricated
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every auto trimmer I have ever used had
moving parts which require lubrication.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those oils will end up on your trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that beaten up trim, like I said
before, it turns into basically mulch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that when the trim is cut into so many
pieces, when you cut it with scissors,
[SPEAKER_03]: you cut it one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cut that leaf off the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe three or four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it most, but you're not making
like mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not turning it into pet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not lawn mowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This trim machine is hitting it and just
mulching all your little pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that leaves that many spots for
moisture, that much surface area for
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture and that many spots for
chlorophyll to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want, you want to hit it with
scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so then all that green comes into your
dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the product into the final.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does juice it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that juice ends up in your hash
and it's tastes like shit and looks like
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then number two, he says, if you plan
to process the Nug, please flush correctly
[SPEAKER_03]: and no spraying or pesticides whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: These chemicals and nutrients tend to
leach into concentration and lead to
[SPEAKER_03]: unsightly slabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's saying flush properly,
flush correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's using unsightly and there's a lot
implied there, especially in a market like
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've sprayed your plants with just
about anything while they're in flower and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's processed into a concentrate,
that concentrate's not going to pass
[SPEAKER_02]: testing and make it onto the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the people he's talking about,
I think he's talking about these black
[SPEAKER_03]: market street growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's, I mean, unsightly
because most of us in a warehouse
[SPEAKER_02]: environment know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this is going to make it onto a...
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to make concentrates,
think about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are going to spray some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's, what is everybody using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Azimax is probably one of the most
popular things.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I worked in the dispensary area,
every, I've toured a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries and all of them have Azimax
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what like the most common spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to talk about something
that Azimax is going to do in a future
[SPEAKER_03]: episode that I've got written down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everyone's got the Azimax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure, and now you spray, it's kind of
waxy, it's kind of oily.
[SPEAKER_03]: You spray Azimax onto your plants at like
probably, I don't know, week two,
[SPEAKER_03]: week three.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit's in the middle of your buds as
your bud grows around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That waxy, oily concentration is still
there and the buds just grow around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still inside there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the buds dry and you grind it up and
you run it through an extraction machine
[SPEAKER_03]: and wash it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually see that little layer of
Azimax right on top of your concentrate
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it float to the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have fucking tasted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've been in rooms that have,
I've sprayed, I've, I didn't know any
[SPEAKER_03]: better when I started growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember the back in the day when we
did not know any better, we would spray
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever the fuck they do to the hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spray this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you read five years later like
this causes immediate blindness.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you touch it, you're like, Oh fuck,
I used to spray that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've sprayed these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've also smelled them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I did because now I can smell
them and taste them in other people's
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neem oil is a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something a lot of the organic or the
natural people like to use at one point or
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you use that shit in flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: My face puckered up a little when you said
Neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everybody that consumes cannabis at
one point or another has hit a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all they tasted for the next hour was
Neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might not have known where it was,
but it's, I mean, that's incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just quit spraying shit that's in flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man Joe environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So flush correctly and don't spray
bullshit on your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to make concentrates out
of it, you know, that's a general rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying, if you're going to use
and make, if you're making medicine or
[SPEAKER_03]: something, you want other people to
consume flush properly and don't spray
[SPEAKER_03]: shit on your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, take proper care of nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke and trim that would be for use in
extracts, proper cure, care, cleaning,
[SPEAKER_03]: and basic hygiene of the plant and
material are critical for quality meds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, one thing that I don't see
enough of is people wearing nitrile or
[SPEAKER_03]: rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wear some gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want all your finger skin in my
concentrates or on my flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're trimming, that shit is sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wear some gloves, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to smoke your skin flakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're bros.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want to smoke your fucking hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also take care of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cause it's going to get turned into
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't mean you can trim your trim your
leaves into a tarp on the floor and have
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole crew walk on them during trim
time and then sweep them up and make hash
[SPEAKER_03]: out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trim that into a container.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's somebody's medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may make edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about like, look at it all as
something that you're going to put into
[SPEAKER_03]: your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're one of them dirty fucking
people to leash it off the floor,
[SPEAKER_03]: look at it as something that a princess
has to put in their mouth because it's got
[SPEAKER_03]: to be clean products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, cure your shit just because you're
going to blast it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was that weird thing at the
beginning of the butane hash days where
[SPEAKER_02]: you made BHO with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't use the stuff that was trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember people saying some crazy shit
like, oh, if it's moldy just blast it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Powdery mildew doesn't exist anymore since
we have BHO.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to make good concentrates,
you really have to produce a bud that's
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to go on a store shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then make concentrates from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of that bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see so many people that fuck up that
last step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like buying a Lamborghini and
wrecking it like in the lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not even off the lot yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you wreck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've spent nine weeks flowering and then
you just spent a week harvesting and now
[SPEAKER_03]: you're just going to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might as well throw it in the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you flush that plant, you can cut it
down and knock off most of the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you plan on blasting the entire
plant, hang it up, let it dry and cure,
[SPEAKER_03]: cut it off the sticks, take the sticks out
of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've pretty much got blastable
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really fuck that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just take care of it, keep it clean,
wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't believe some of the stuff
that I've seen and heard of coming in from
[SPEAKER_03]: like grows coming into extraction labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have found cigarette butts,
scissors, razor blades, forks from lunch,
[SPEAKER_03]: like all kinds of shit in the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so bad two years ago when we
started implementing lab testing that a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of extract companies just went out
and bought the hundred thousand or two
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred to three hundred thousand piece of
equipment so that they could in-house lab
[SPEAKER_02]: test shit as it came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some of the stuff they were
processing was so nasty, it was fucking up
[SPEAKER_02]: their machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they processed the material for the
first guy in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dirties up the machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else that gets run that day is
taking home a piece of that trash that
[SPEAKER_02]: came through in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little residual Asimax or whatever
on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they're testing it all before
it goes into the into their machinery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that none of that's possible anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking about somebody, another farm
running some stuff and throwing some
[SPEAKER_03]: Asimax in there and then my farm running
this clean organic product in there and
[SPEAKER_03]: just mixing it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I've got your Asimax residuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cringe when I see stuff like black
market stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they're like, just got some awesome
sap and you look at it and it's black and
[SPEAKER_02]: soupy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And God only knows what's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're so lucky here that we've got
lab testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some regulation that we can get away
from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it was more available to the
recreational grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lab testing is not as available,
but in the future it will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things that I'm going to
hit coming up in this last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So speaking of perfect timing,
we're 36 minutes into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have not gotten to the main topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Soda Pop for the cool
Facebook post.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end, he hashtagged that the machine
knows the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So supports my claims that trim machines
suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care of your plants and take care of
the trim and nug if you plan to make
[SPEAKER_03]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck out there this croptober season.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope your plants made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope none of them got stolen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that if thieves did take your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it croptober.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also call it homie season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff goes missing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ripper season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some social media stuff already.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they took your shit, they're not your
homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now it's getting close to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing outdoors in any way,
shape or form, it's smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that's sleeping out there,
half my friends are sleeping outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: knows it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're freaking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take some deep breaths.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your shit getting stolen is not the worst
thing that can happen to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they did take your shit, I hope they
left part of it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they were a cool thief.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had four plants, I hope they only
took one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just unfortunate that we still have
to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we could just grow out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody comes to steal the tomatoes in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are they stealing cannabis when
cannabis is somebody's cancer medicine?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just worth so much in certain places.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like leaving your bank account in the
backyard in some places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody that listens to this show would
steal any plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's jump into this email that I got.
[SPEAKER_03]: This email, this dude signed his name,
DabSmiths, and he says, Hey, what's up,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge fan of the podcast, as I've said
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I had a few questions I thought
could be a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in Michigan and we just passed three
bills pushing us into a seed to sale
[SPEAKER_03]: system based on Colorado system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to quickly talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, we have a seed to sale
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that is for sale recreational
or medically in the state of Colorado has
[SPEAKER_03]: been grown from seed or a clone underneath
a Colorado marijuana enforcement division
[SPEAKER_03]: camera inside of a Colorado marijuana
enforcement division regulated facility,
[SPEAKER_03]: also known as an optional premises
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that happens in there,
every square fucking inch of this facility
[SPEAKER_03]: is on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have it set up to where if you can be
in that building and there is a spot where
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not on camera, you have to put
another camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can hide around this little
partition or behind this door,
[SPEAKER_03]: they want another camera in there so that
you cannot hide anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that happens in there is on
camera, which that's where the seed part
[SPEAKER_03]: starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow a seed, it's on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow a clone, it is on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is given an RFID tag.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call those a med tag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to tag every single plant and put
it into a system known as metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they are tagged.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are accounted for.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are part of your plant count that
you're allowed to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: When a regular walks into a room,
they've got a tool that they can just hold
[SPEAKER_02]: up and press a button.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tells them exactly how many plants are
in that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because of the RFID on those plant
tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is tracked out ridiculously in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridiculously.
[SPEAKER_03]: As those plants grow, they are now clones
in my computer system.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I put them into bigger pots,
now they have to be clicked into veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I move them to another room,
they have to be marked in this little tab
[SPEAKER_03]: on the computer what room they move into.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I move them into flower, I have to
change their room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to change their status and I have
to mark that all the tags are still the
[SPEAKER_03]: same numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything stays on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's harvested, all of the trimmers
are in a room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is done on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's trimmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trim is kept in one area.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trash is weighed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the trash is weighed before it's
thrown away so that we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cut down the plant, put it on a scale,
hand it to the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They separate buds and sticks and trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weigh the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weigh the trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weigh the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We throw the trash away.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trash is documented in the Marijuana
Enforcement Division computer,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is known as metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it is put into specific weight
packages.
[SPEAKER_03]: The packages are documented in a computer
with a tag number on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tag, again, has an RFID code on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they are put into what's called a
manifest, a transfer manifest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that transfer manifest has the
vehicle operator's name, driver's license
[SPEAKER_03]: number, license plate number, vehicle make
model description, then you have to type
[SPEAKER_03]: in the exact route that you were
traveling, leaving this street,
[SPEAKER_03]: turning left on this street, right onto
this street to the destination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then once you get there, it is unpacked
and checked on camera by the dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's taken to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's put on a shelf all under camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it is sold all under this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is recorded and covered and
there's absolutely no room for leakage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only time that anything could happen
is in a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're following Marijuana
Enforcement Division rules, every package
[SPEAKER_03]: that leaves the Grove facility is vacuum
sealed in a vacuum bag with a Marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: Enforcement Division sticker on it that
has a specific weight written on it with a
[SPEAKER_03]: strain name on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that is also on a paper that matches
that tag number that has the corresponding
[SPEAKER_03]: weight.
I checked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even tell you how many hundreds of
shipments in my day and not one of them
[SPEAKER_02]: was off by anything ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're in those vacuum sealed bags and
I open it in the car while I'm driving,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no way for me to fucking seal
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is this razor knifed open?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only opportunity, really,
and that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's going to get away with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get caught if you do that
stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly, highly, highly, highly regulated
is what we're getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the three bills they just
passed is a seat to sale regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds stringent and it sounds
ridiculous, but when we have problems like
[SPEAKER_03]: we've recently talked about on the show,
there have been batches of concentrates
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been made with flowers that were
sprayed with pesticides that were not
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed since each plant was tracked.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we apply a pesticide, we write down
every tag number that that pesticide is
[SPEAKER_03]: applied to or a foliar spray or any type
of soil treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that happens to the plant is
tracked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can see that everything grown in
facility number 403, extracted by
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction company 402, and there's B
dashes at the end of those, everything
[SPEAKER_03]: from that batch was contaminated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant tag number 16555 through 1000
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the state just releases a list,
retailers check the serial numbers on
[SPEAKER_02]: their product, and you know instantly if
you're carrying some tainted product.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's cannabis or hash or edibles or
topicals, you can pull all of that off the
shelf safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sale in the legal market in Colorado,
you can follow all of it from origin to
[SPEAKER_02]: retail and back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely helpful, even though it
seems really... When you're doing it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it seems obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge pain in the ass getting it
implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me a couple of months of working
with, but after like a month or two of
[SPEAKER_03]: doing metric every single day,
I was like, oh, this is easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes part of your routine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just treat your work day like chess
moves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you accept that, you're good to
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make notes on a little piece of
paper of things that I needed to do in
[SPEAKER_03]: metric as I did it, and then I would go to
the office and just catch up metric right
[SPEAKER_03]: before lunch, and then go back and catch
up metric right before I leave at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or when it got down to cutting clones and
doing things that needed a lot of metric,
[SPEAKER_03]: attention, I had a little cart and I would
just take my MacBook to work and sign into
[SPEAKER_03]: metric right there and just do it on the
cart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was second nature by the time I was
done there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the seed to sale system is definitely
helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to continue with the email
because this is going to be a long damn
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast if I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, Michigan, we passed three bills
pushing us into a seed to sale system
[SPEAKER_03]: based on Colorado system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you and White Mike
could touch on the subject, like how do I
[SPEAKER_03]: go about finding out information from the
city about how many licensed facilities
[SPEAKER_03]: they will allow?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he also says, what's the biggest
hurdle going from a basement grow to a
[SPEAKER_03]: warehouse, which I think is more directed
at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he continues to say, I know you have
recently made the switch from soil to
[SPEAKER_03]: cocoa and any advice on that transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am planning on running Veg Bloom and I'm
already in a basement, but do you add
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else to the line as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some things you didn't expect
going to such a large scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: And any other advice you may think one
would need to know about taking a leap
[SPEAKER_03]: into the big leagues?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again for such a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you can answer some questions for
me and other questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Others, I'm not sure how you wanted to end
that, but yes, we'll answer your question,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let Mike go with the first part
because I've got a lot of stuff to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, lawyer up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to get into the cannabis
industry, lawyer up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a lawyer and then get another lawyer
to make sure that that lawyer is not
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then get a lawyer to keep an eye on
your accountant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get two lawyers and an accountant and make
sure they're all fucking keeping an eye on
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my first point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bit of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should really be like the first half
of like every business school one-on-one
[SPEAKER_02]: class.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you're a lawyer and don't let
them be too good of friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully your lawyer and your accountant
don't seem like they like each other
[SPEAKER_03]: because then they can't team up on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want them embezzling from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just keep them watching each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's stealing from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's stealing from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just keep them like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep them watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike, the first question, how do we go
about finding out information from the
[SPEAKER_03]: city about how many licensed facilities
they will allow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we hit record, I jumped online.
[SPEAKER_02]: We jumped online and checked out some of
the stuff about your law.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Michigan, local control is part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from the cannabis,
surprise, surprise reported here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: But according to the cannabis,
the local control part in Michigan's law
[SPEAKER_02]: is growers, processors, shippers,
testing facilities and dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could not obtain a state license unless
their local government adopts an
[SPEAKER_02]: authorizing ordinance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Municipalities could cap the number of
licenses within their borders and assess
[SPEAKER_02]: no more than a $5,000 fee per license.
[SPEAKER_02]: A state board would charge application and
renewal fees to cover costs including for
[SPEAKER_02]: substance abuse programs and law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what that means is you're
going to need two licenses to open any
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of marijuana business in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about medical marijuana
businesses here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recreational is not quite legal in
Michigan yet, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your local area does not create some
sort of licensing process for these
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses, you can't get a state license
to operate in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you find out what those rules
are in your area?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first step is head to your local
planning and zoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hop online, spend a few seconds with
Google, figure out where your planning and
[SPEAKER_02]: zoning department is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while you're there, you're going to
want to look up city council or county
[SPEAKER_02]: commissioner, whichever sort of governing
body decides the land use rules for your
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, here in Pueblo, Colorado,
in the city, we have a city council who
[SPEAKER_02]: makes those decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the county of Pueblo,
we have a board of county commissioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people are totally separate and have
totally different rules for marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses because they're totally
separate governmental entities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume it's very similar in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first step is figure out which
municipality, city, county, whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to have your marijuana businesses in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head down to planning and zoning or city
council or whatever and ask is your first
[SPEAKER_02]: step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because this is brand new,
you're likely to be met with a confused
[SPEAKER_02]: look, which means you've got some work
ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky, the area you're in has
favorable government officials who saw
[SPEAKER_02]: this coming and have already crafted some
sort of land use code specifying which
[SPEAKER_02]: zoning designations the property for these
businesses have to carry, distances from
[SPEAKER_02]: schools, libraries, churches, those kinds
of rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they haven't gotten that far yet,
you're looking at a year or more of public
[SPEAKER_02]: hearings while these rules get hashed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, you've got some work ahead
of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I sort of got my activist
credentials in Pueblo was helping Pueblo
[SPEAKER_02]: do all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you've checked with planning and
zoning to see A, if your area has these
[SPEAKER_02]: rules yet, and if not, how they're being
created, the next thing to do is get
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself involved in that conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really easy to do, especially as
these rules are being crafted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever governmental agencies crafting
this rules will take a lot of public
[SPEAKER_02]: comment to get the community's input,
how far they want them from schools,
[SPEAKER_02]: how high the licensing fee should be,
if they want to add any sort of other
[SPEAKER_02]: rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, there's an area in Colorado
that requires marijuana businesses to be
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% energy neutral, which means they
can't consume electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't also generate, wrap your head
around that one in a county that doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: allow outdoor growing, but get involved in
this conversation now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way you can help nudge or guide
the regulators as they write the rules for
[SPEAKER_02]: your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're smart, you'll help them steer
clear of business number caps and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, really, really bad for
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just creates monopolies, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It immediately creates a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It forces the local municipality to do a
bunch of obnoxious things like having a
[SPEAKER_02]: license lottery and some sort of review
process for applicants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's additionally unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it creates a real legislative and
practical nightmare for the government
[SPEAKER_02]: agency trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet in Colorado, they continue to do
it all over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just get involved with this
conversation now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in all likelihood, you'll be able to
steer whatever local government agency
[SPEAKER_02]: that's writing these rules into crafting
smart rules for your agency so that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not looking at huge licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that they have a cap in the state
rules at five grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it as high as 50 here in
counties and cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state only charges five or seven or
10, depending on the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the size of your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen individual counties charge
much, much more than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's going to need a ton of money,
a lawyer, an accountant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you said planning and zoning and city
council.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should he also join forces with his local
marijuana activist groups?
[SPEAKER_02]: That depends on the climate in your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go down to planning and zoning and
are greeted by a really friendly person
[SPEAKER_02]: who hands you a printout of the rules
they've already crafted and all you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to do is fill out the application and find
a piece of property that's zoned
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately and get a rental agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You live in a really enlightened area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's likely to happen is you're
going to be met with a confused look and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're only going to just be creating
these rules now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if that's the case, your best bet
is to start attending county meetings,
[SPEAKER_02]: zoning meetings, just watching how those
meetings take place, getting a feel for
[SPEAKER_02]: the people in charge of those meetings
who's on your city council, who's on your
[SPEAKER_02]: board of county commissioners or your
zoning board.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they like and dislike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it just takes a lot of sitting
and watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, watching laws get made is
incredibly boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're legalizing marijuana across
the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to write all those laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want really, really messed up
laws written by people who don't
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what we're doing and what we're
working with, stand back and wait for
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody else to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of the rules that were
proposed here in Colorado during this
[SPEAKER_02]: process were asinine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took a while for people like myself
to explain to legislatures why it was
[SPEAKER_02]: asinine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at face value, a lot of them
seemed like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you take it into practice,
like the last episode, we talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were ready to get rid of all drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just we'll get rid of them, period.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never been a problem anywhere,
but we're going to cut out a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: section of the Edibles industry just for
no reason at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that are making these rules are
not consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just people.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times they don't know anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their background is in finance and they
were a dentist for 20 years or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know anything about mass
production of cannabis, retail rules,
[SPEAKER_02]: what those rules might be for alcohol and
tobacco retailers, why little tweaks to
[SPEAKER_02]: those rules are appropriate for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, getting them to understand all
that can be quite a bit of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've probably got some fear in them
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go into this knowing that most
of the people you talk to were the hall
[SPEAKER_02]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be a dick about it, but when you
start going to city government meetings,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, that's what happened to all
those people from high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just disappeared from my world after
graduation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got jobs in city government.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they all went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff went on tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these people got jobs at their local
zoning department and have worked their
[SPEAKER_02]: way through the ranks of city bureaucracy
for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the people you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not bad people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them are wonderful, but they don't
really know anything about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know why we consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know why it's fun at concerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just know it gives them a headache
when they go see popular music.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the extent of their
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting them to understand that moving
all marijuana production indoors is
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly bad for the environment,
especially when cannabis can be grown so
[SPEAKER_02]: effectively outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That conversation, we failed at having a
lot of places in Colorado, which is why
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo County is so popular with
production facilities right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're one of the few places you can grow
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're one of the few places you can
grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're one of the few places where land
isn't ridiculously expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've got the trifecta down here,
and that's why we have so many companies
[SPEAKER_02]: locating that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's changing the whole landscape
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell that there's some money here
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have any money here before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can tell that there's actually
some future for this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had our county commissioners followed suit
with Denver and Aurora and Boulder and
[SPEAKER_02]: Longmont and Lakewood and banned outdoor
growing, banned greenhouse growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: pushed it all indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The economic recovery we have enjoyed has
been very, or would have been very
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in Michigan, I know you guys have
been taking economic hit after economic
[SPEAKER_02]: hit for the last, my whole life,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can really be an economic engine for
growth and prosperity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a tidal wave of money that's
gonna fix everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched the video on Detroit not too
long ago where people were just assembling
[SPEAKER_02]: skyscrapers and selling parts of scrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like active skyscrapers or old
skyscrapers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like old ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as there's not still people in
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of recession in Detroit is
significantly different than what we see
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we've got Pueblo and Detroit
have gone through similar things,
[SPEAKER_02]: the scale is very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a state like Michigan, marijuana really
could be two or three or 20 or 30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now these people aren't all gonna be
making 75,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are gonna be making 10,
50 an hour, 12, 50 an hour, 14 an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's still thousands of jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still talking about hundreds of
millions of dollars into improving
[SPEAKER_02]: properties and bringing them up to code.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Jeff starts talking about is what
do you need to know going from greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: to warehouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: The improvements that are required in a
lot of the warehouses to get them up to
[SPEAKER_02]: where he's gonna get at, that costs a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that improvement is massive for the
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We needed to upgrade our airflow system a
little bit at Green and Healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was getting some estimates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to connect two rooms,
two sides of a building and just run it
[SPEAKER_03]: through one air conditioning thing and
handle some humidity and some air control
[SPEAKER_03]: through one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, oh yeah, probably six to
8,000 each side to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just for a small air exchange setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going from the home to the
commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he said 8,000 each side, I was like,
oh, this is gonna take a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: The economic boom a state can feel if this
is done correctly, if it's done smartly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have it done correctly,
really takes people willing to do the
[SPEAKER_02]: legwork, to go to city council meetings,
to go to state legislature meetings and
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that they don't do thousand foot
from everywhere rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember here in Pueblo, the first
proposal I saw for buffer zones,
[SPEAKER_02]: the distance your marijuana business has
to be from other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were like 25 different businesses on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nursing homes, all kinds of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Churches, liquor stores, pharmacies,
nursing homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a specific business name because
they specifically seek out adults with
[SPEAKER_02]: developmental disabilities as employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that company's kind of niche is
giving that whole segment of the
[SPEAKER_02]: population a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our original legislation had a
thousand feet from their property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the middle of all of this,
Colorado redefined what a thousand feet
[SPEAKER_02]: from a school meant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed how it's measured halfway
through the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't like feet to inches kind of
distance, but it was what they call as the
[SPEAKER_02]: crow flies versus walking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so originally dispensing owners walked
out their front door and took the street
[SPEAKER_02]: on foot version to the nearest school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then applied that way saying that they
were a thousand three hundred feet from a
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they changed the rule to ask the
crow flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out the nearest pieces of
their property lines are only six hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: feet apart because of math.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was literally the only mass shutdown
of businesses we had in Colorado is
[SPEAKER_02]: because that rule changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, for you, when Jeff first
told me this was a question, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, that's a whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do that as part of a thing
because where are your state is right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, this applies to like 14
different states across the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what happens in November's
election.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fourteen different states will be going
through the process we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: right now or are about to be, depending on
how the election goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of you need to start thinking
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who makes these decisions in your area?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of process is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I get involved in that?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't make those decisions and
start writing those rules, somebody will
[SPEAKER_03]: write them for you.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately for you, this wasn't as
bad when Colorado was doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The anti-pop movement is very vocal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just the DEA and the police and law
enforcement in the prisons and police
[SPEAKER_02]: unions when Colorado was doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are parents groups were freaked
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get into this, mainly you'll
find that the anti-pop groups are just
[SPEAKER_02]: people who didn't have anything in their
world and needed a something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trying to remind us all that in eighth
grade we learned that pot is bad has
[SPEAKER_02]: become their goal in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not very good at research or
arguments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got a mailer or a flyer in the
mail with a bunch of non-factual claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're dealing with a nasty one of
these down here in Pueblo, but the one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing they really, really are is vocal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do get involved in this
process in your area, one of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: things you're going to realize is that the
old dude who shows up to every meeting and
[SPEAKER_02]: won't shut up about whatever their topic
is, everybody that's involved in city
[SPEAKER_02]: government knows that asshole's topic
intimately.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know every in and out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're sick of hearing about it for
one reason, because that dude shows up and
[SPEAKER_02]: makes a lot of noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the anti-pop people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll rally 35 or 40 church moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll show up in force to two or three
hearings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden your city doesn't get
to enjoy any of the economic benefits of
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every marijuana consumer in that
geographic area that wants to participate
[SPEAKER_02]: in the legal market has to drive to the
next county to do so because of who showed
[SPEAKER_02]: up at a meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really, really, really need to start
taking a look at this, especially if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be part of the industry as an
owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a chance to get in on the
ground floor right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're willing to put in serious
legislative legwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my half of the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just glanced over a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, we're in an hour and two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost tempted to make this a two part
question and cut this dude off now and
[SPEAKER_03]: make another episode out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your half of the question is huge because
there's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can give them the glance over
if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think we would, there's enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he asked like four questions in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're going to make this a two
parter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you down to record a little bit more
with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could use like a two minute break.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you needed a stretch break,
a cigarette break.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could use a fresh drink and a couple of
dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ladies and gentlemen, this podcast is,
yeah, this podcast has gone just over an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather record two episodes out of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike and I are going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more questions for your
listeners, cause we kind of do us on the
[SPEAKER_02]: fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I twist your arm and make this a
Thursday episode or Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to put these out.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is going to be a Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: One's going to be a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, I don't know if this is,
for me, this is more than interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to do a week teaser.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think our listeners are that
dedicated, but I want to hook them up and
[SPEAKER_02]: do it closer if we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, I've been trying, a lot of times
I try to do two episodes a week,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I can't commit to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't dedicate to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't made the promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have trouble getting one of these
together a month now, just cause we're
[SPEAKER_02]: both busy adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to make sure that these
two episodes come out on a Monday and a
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday, back to back quick like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you like this content that
comes from listeners and listener
[SPEAKER_03]: generated material, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to wrap it up quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you follow Mike on social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all we're going to do for
this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike sneaking away to go use the men's
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to grab a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take some dabs and then we're
going to record another episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ladies and gentlemen, until next time,
take a fat dab and give your mama hug for
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're missing righteous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire is burning Fire, fire Babylon the
fire is burning Babylon the fire is
[SPEAKER_00]: burning Babylon the fire is burning
[SPEAKER_00]: Babylon the fire is burning Babylon the
fire is burning Babylon the fire is burning
