[SPEAKER_00]: truly ross to jeff i had a really good
time on that podcast i had a lot of fun i
[SPEAKER_00]: was trying not to interrupt too much
because we know that our friend scotty
[SPEAKER_00]: real does kind of butt in a little bit
with a lot of stuff to say i didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to overrun the show because i'm not the a
regular member of that show i wanted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a good gracious guest also had to fill my
shoes had to pull my own weight and be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved so it's hard to find that
borderline there but i think we did a good
[SPEAKER_00]: job on the show uh thanks to everybody for
the compliments the comments the feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: if you haven't seen it go watch it leave
some comments on the video most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly let them know that ross to
jeff sent you so you know to go watch that
[SPEAKER_00]: show uh what am i going to talk about
before we get to the birthday celebration
[SPEAKER_00]: i wrote down the words super stony
tolerance swings holy shit i may have
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about this in the past on the show
it may have been a long time how about you
[SPEAKER_00]: right now i'm going through a phase where
i can basically open up my jar of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates and just look at it and be
stoned out of my fucking dome i go through
[SPEAKER_00]: phases where uh the guy at the dispensary
is like bro you were here yesterday and
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm like i know i know trust me i know and
then i go through phases like today where
[SPEAKER_00]: i could just look at the jar and be
fucking wrecked all day long right now i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going through one of those phases where i
could take one dab and i get so high and
[SPEAKER_00]: then i go through it'll probably last a
week maybe three days four or five days
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a week tops and then next week i'll
go by concentrates and i will smoke all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the concentrates and not even get a nice
buzz so do you go through weird shifts and
[SPEAKER_00]: swings in your tolerance i definitely
notice it is based on a lot of it's based
[SPEAKER_00]: on my hydration i haven't been hydrating
properly i've been a little extra uh
[SPEAKER_00]: physically busy been working a little bit
more physically been in a grow a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more and that's dehydrating me a
little bit i'm wondering if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to the extra buzz i've been
getting my diet has changed a little
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly been eating more food and still
getting extra high when i smoke so i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: curious send me some feedback wherever you
interact with me do you go through phases
[SPEAKER_00]: where sometimes you can smoke all of the
product and not get stoned at all and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you go through phases where you
smoke a little bit of the product and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fucking wrecked for the day do you
go through phases ebbs and flows like that
[SPEAKER_00]: with your tolerance give me some feedback
you can hit me up on twitter it's at gf y
[SPEAKER_00]: h podcast you can find me on instagram it
is uh at iri underscore genetics or of
[SPEAKER_00]: course there is an instagram for the show
i don't use it very often it is the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart podcast on instagram of
course there is canna buzz i love canna
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz uh leave a comment in the youtube
video just give me some feedback let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know am i the only one that goes through
these weird ebbs and flows of tolerance i
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't take a tolerance break or anything
i've been smoking i did a tolerance break
[SPEAKER_00]: a while back but i mean i'm back on the
train we've been smoking we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: puffing but man the past couple of days i
could take a dab and it's like high school
[SPEAKER_00]: high i blow out the dab and i'm like whoa
i'm silly gotta take a couple of seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta get a couple of snacks in me gotta
recharge anyway if you can't tell today's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them days when i got fucking high
as shit from just a couple of dabs so so
[SPEAKER_00]: totally super rambly now here's where we
are going to get serious i'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: shift gears here really quickly and this
isn't going to last for very long we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get out of this but this is
required as a responsible person with a
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone with a platform as a fucking
human this is something that i feel i am
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible to do i need to take a moment

new at listening some of you may this may
[SPEAKER_00]: be your first episode listening some of
you may have listened since episode one
[SPEAKER_00]: when the show was called the i grow
culture podcast let's ramble about that
[SPEAKER_00]: for a moment um oh by the way there's not
going to be any grow talk or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that in this episode this is all just
going to be a birthday celebration i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to ramble and regroup from the past
couple of episodes which have been
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful we're gonna have a good time and
then after this one we're gonna jump deep
[SPEAKER_00]: into the grow lessons again um but back in
the day the show was called the i grow
[SPEAKER_00]: culture podcast i started off with i grow
culture is episode one it was a play on
[SPEAKER_00]: like ipad ipod i everything it was a
lowercase i and then the word grow with a
[SPEAKER_00]: capital g i grow like ipad uh you know
what i'm saying right all the apple stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's i grow culture uh because it was
the i grow i was growing some culture i
[SPEAKER_00]: was growing cannabis culture i was growing
we were cultivating and it was also a play
[SPEAKER_00]: on the word agriculture is where i was
going with that i grow culture i was also
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of when you put i and stuff
it makes a little rastafari feel that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole other avenue if you understand the
rastafari lingo then you get that but um
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30 or 40 episodes into the i grow
culture podcast i received a cease and
[SPEAKER_00]: desist letter from a company called i grow
culture that's right they were a a college
[SPEAKER_00]: accredited company who made courses for
colleges for agricultural studies so they
[SPEAKER_00]: were teaching like ag schools they were
the ones making the books for the
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture schools and they kindly said
hey we see you've got a new podcast or a
[SPEAKER_00]: few episodes in we would appreciate it if
you stop using the word i grow culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do continue to use that then we
will have to have our lawyers step in and
[SPEAKER_00]: sue the shit out of you it's not exactly
what they said i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: paraphrasing but that was when i decided
[SPEAKER_00]: i would appreciate you to grow from your
heart
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow from your heart to grow from your
heart to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart to grow from your heart i
have grown so far as a podcaster i feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like i've grown a lot as a cultivator a
commercial cultivator a home cultivator
[SPEAKER_00]: also i feel like i've grown so much as a
teacher i understand so much better how to
[SPEAKER_00]: guide you to success now man i feel like
we've come a long way together so my main
[SPEAKER_00]: point of that ramble was some of you are

[SPEAKER_00]: my progression i went from having a
terrible audio quality sound that was over
[SPEAKER_00]: compressed and sound tinny focused way too
much on just the wrong stuff i didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: i was new at podcasting then we improved
the sound then we improved the video now
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in 4k most of the time it's in 4k i

shiny put all kinds of video touches to it
[SPEAKER_00]: then i put it out there and just hope you

be fucking weird so thank you guys i
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate you i love you and i respect

[SPEAKER_00]: of these thanks uh notes i want to send a
big thanks to mike mike is an integral

[SPEAKER_00]: big thanks to mike uh he contributes a lot

[SPEAKER_00]: the show but he'll send me a message and
say make sure you talk about this or he'll
[SPEAKER_00]: say when you talk about this make sure to
cover this point so mike is a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show behind the scenes behind the
camera in front of the camera thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: bro i appreciate that i want to thank mike
i want to thank all of the guests who have
[SPEAKER_00]: been on the show everybody from day one uh
kevin mike spence maddie garden of weeden
[SPEAKER_00]: uh joe buzzy jesse grows especially uh
sloppy's been on the show i'm gonna miss
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody barefoot uh organic as fuck
everybody that's been on the show thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you i appreciate it it's been awesome uh
you guys make the show without you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: coming on the show without you being a
part of the show the show wouldn't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to uh double door dank uh out
send some love to double door dank
[SPEAKER_00]: actually you guys double door has been uh
dealing with some health issues so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: send him some jaw love as well but thanks
to all the people that have been on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show i'm sure i missed several guests
there that i did not mention because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: had quite a few people on the show but
thank you guys uh all the people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered at the table in the past in the
present and in the future uh even friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that have fallen off we've had some
falling outs we've had some some rifts in
[SPEAKER_00]: the force here if you will still big shout
out to all those people that were on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show without you guys the show wouldn't
have existed and people say hey why do you
[SPEAKER_00]: leave up some of those episodes that
person is proving themselves to be a phony
[SPEAKER_00]: or has proved themselves to be a fool
since they were on your show why do you
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it up i can't change history taking
down a podcast episode is not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the fact that we were cool at that
point that we were friends at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: that episode that knowledge that info is
still probably valid and then we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: what that person has evolved into some
people have changed some people wearing
[SPEAKER_00]: masks some people have really evolved into
bigger and better people some people have
[SPEAKER_00]: been abandoned and deleted and blocked
completely so the reason i don't take down
[SPEAKER_00]: those messages are those old episodes is
because it's a time capsule the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: happened those things were said i'm kind
of a historian here doing this so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why some of the episodes if you ask why do
you leave that up it's a time capsule
[SPEAKER_00]: can't change history just by deleting an
episode can't change the future by
[SPEAKER_00]: deleting an episode all right so thanks to
all of the guests past present and future
[SPEAKER_00]: even if we don't kick it anymore even if i
don't rep your brand or you don't rep my
[SPEAKER_00]: shit thank you it was still worth having
you on the show uh also thank you to all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the shows which have had me as a guest
uh i've been on a lot of podcasts i think
[SPEAKER_00]: the first show i appeared on may have been
john doe radio with tim martin what that's
[SPEAKER_00]: some old school shit tim i'd love to see
you get moving again you talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it fired up maybe you've gotten it
going i haven't seen it on itunes i look
[SPEAKER_00]: for you occasionally if the john doe radio
fired up again i would give it a follow uh
[SPEAKER_00]: but tim martin was one of the reasons why
i started the show uh his show inspired me
[SPEAKER_00]: there were a lot of shows that inspired me
we don't need to go too far into that uh
[SPEAKER_00]: but i was talking a lot about cannabis
teaching my friends and then somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: asked me the same question like three
times in a row and i thought i should
[SPEAKER_00]: record this and do it and that's why a
podcast started but thanks to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that had me as a guest i was on
john doe radio that got me started i've
[SPEAKER_00]: been on the dude grows show i've been on
medical marijuana radio with our friend ls

okay so here's one we should really make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to touch on big shout out to the gang
at embracing organics embracing organics
[SPEAKER_00]: invited me to be on their video zoom
podcast which goes live on youtube i was
[SPEAKER_00]: hesitant for a couple of reasons at the
time i wasn't doing video shows i wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared or comfortable to go on video
also i wasn't doing live shows at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: so i was about to be on camera live that
was really nerve-wracking it was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: uh made me nervous to be honest with you
but we did it and after that there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: turning back now i get on the microphone
and i talk and i ramble and this is like
[SPEAKER_00]: where i live this is my space right here i
feel so good in the podcasting zone i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know that i would have gotten
comfortable on the video i don't know that

without my buddy dirtman dan and the
[SPEAKER_00]: embracing organics crew so we all owe a
special thank you to dirtman dan and
[SPEAKER_00]: embracing organics because i wouldn't be
doing this show the way i'm doing it
