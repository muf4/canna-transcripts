[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
barefoot grower, if you're a new smoker or
[SPEAKER_03]: a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
activist or even someone who's just
[SPEAKER_03]: curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, my friends call me Ross
DeGefo, and thank you guys again for
[SPEAKER_03]: joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat Kud and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday evening
in Pueblo, Colorado, and it is hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is shit for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it so warm, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Global warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Global warming, you blame me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost 7 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Across the table from me is a repeat
offender.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you caught that in the
intro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did say barefoot grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy, Will, is a barefoot grower,
is back on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to be back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lips are all sticky because we just
took some super delicious dabs,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the dab rig that I've got from Elevate
has that mouthpiece that makes your mouth
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of do the kissy face, and it made my
lips all sticky, so my words are going,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's pretty funny over here for seeing me
just trying to struggle and talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this sticky dab wax in my mustache,
dab residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, I'm ranting now,
but back in the day, I used to go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: clinic in Denver and they sold this Durbin
poison wax, and it had the best high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after you would smoke it, if you put
your teeth together, they would stick
[SPEAKER_03]: together a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just sit there and just stick my
teeth together and pull them apart and
[SPEAKER_03]: just do it over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what that feeling is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was almost like you took a bite of a
crayon, kind of, but for some reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved the texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will quit ranting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I got to give anybody a shout out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass
because I've been hitting this orange
[SPEAKER_03]: pumpkin rig like a boss.
[SPEAKER_03]: That banger is filthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rig needs a bath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again, you guys, for the dope rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you still blowing glass, dude,
or has that kind of been- No, that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of put on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping to maybe one day get back into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you miss it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do miss it every now and then,
especially- I can see that you got a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: smile when we started talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whenever I go, because I have some
friends that still do it, and if I go to
[SPEAKER_02]: their house or whatever and I get into the
studio, it kind of was like, I miss it,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, your fingers started spinning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm always just like, man,
I want to kind of ask them if I can hop
[SPEAKER_02]: behind a torch, but they're not blowing
glass, so I don't want to intrude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gas is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, and I know that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glass is expensive too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you still got the spin
technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think I do, but I don't know if
it's like riding a bike or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to kind of figure it out,
because I mean, I would take like a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of days off and I'd notice a difference
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got these big fumbly wookie hands,
and I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're blowing glass, you guys,
I do not, I know very, very little about
[SPEAKER_03]: making glass, but when you're blowing
glass, you got to turn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to turn your right hand and your
left hand at the same time, and you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: have the torch in the middle-ish or
whatever section you're heating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if one hand spins faster than the
other, your shit starts twisting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if one hand goes higher than the
other, your piece starts bending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a flame in front of you and
it's hot and your muscles start twitching
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a pain in the ass,
but so shout out to the people who do the
[SPEAKER_03]: twist.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So man, your work was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you get back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'll be able to do it one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about your new venture now.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I wrote down that I
wanted to make sure we cover is that you
[SPEAKER_03]: went from a basement grow to a large
facility in a very short time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how long did, you're from North
Carolina, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you grow ganja in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like had did it for a few years
there, not successfully for the first
[SPEAKER_02]: year, tried in Asheville and just failed
miserably.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got into flower and then like sprayed
Cal Mag on the plants as a foliar one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, totally like just, I really
don't know what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those just had no,
nobody to ask, no nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thought that was how I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So killed those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I lived in Charlotte,
I had an apartment and I got a tent and
[SPEAKER_02]: started growing in my closet, actually got
some genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was some, some, uh, I read genetics
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this couldn't have been too long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was about, let's see, I've been
here for about a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd have been about two and a half
years ago.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was going to be one of my next
questions is how long you've been here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you, so you grew in Charlotte then
successfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple of harvests there in my
closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which strain did you pull off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart of gold.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an easy one to grow too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a golden goat and grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a super good cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a place in my heart for golden
goat because of that strain specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have a golden goat clone in the
future for you if you remind me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take clones of her in just a
few nights here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, remind me of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you pull off a couple of harvests there
and how sketchy is that growing in North
[SPEAKER_03]: Carolina?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the way I was doing it,
I mean, I didn't, I had a little a CFL
[SPEAKER_02]: hood thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a really low key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't put off a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had four little plants in my,
in the little 10, it was like a two by
[SPEAKER_02]: four 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was pretty small.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I was doing like a basement grow or
something, yeah, that'd be real sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People talk there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've met so many, everybody that I've met
from North Carolina, like Spence,
[SPEAKER_03]: Matty, Slop is kind of from North
Carolina, Thong, all you folks was Tater
[SPEAKER_03]: from North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See all you folks that I met from North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I missed a few people guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are all awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Danny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all super great dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every one of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, super rad people from North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew other people from other outside
of your career that are just super
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like your guys' whole town moved here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a ghost town now with no cool
people there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the shitty people just stayed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the cool people came right over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've been here for about a year and a
half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since May of 2015, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long did it take you to get a gross
set up when you got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the first thing I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got here and like day one went out into
the shed in the backyard, started gutting
[SPEAKER_02]: it out, took down all the shelves,
put up my LAR.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the shit still in the U-Haul truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even bring a U-Haul.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just packed my car up and drove out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love people that do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad it worked out for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people came out and weren't able
to put it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad you're motivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motivated potheads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how long did it take?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you blew glass for like about six or
eight months, it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, about six, seven months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was paying attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got into, how did,
tell us where you're working now with the
[SPEAKER_03]: large facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am now at a SIN cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to use that for a strain name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when we were talking about
that, but yeah, it's a SIN cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our dispensary up in Lakewood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our grow greenhouse is here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really big, huge facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a big step up from the
basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many plants are you in charge of?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 320 plants in flower at all times
that I'm in charge of.
[SPEAKER_02]: What size pots?
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are huge plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those aren't just little baby plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty big plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the summer, it's not uncommon to see
like every plant hit a half pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often in the summer at peak harvest or
at peak flowering, how often do those
[SPEAKER_03]: plants need to be watered?
[SPEAKER_02]: We water every other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the plants like in the center of
the greenhouse where they get more sun and
[SPEAKER_02]: more light every single day in the middle
of the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a couple beds that we were hitting
every single day this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many gallons of water
you're throwing in a 20 gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's around two and a half gallons per,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly expected more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm doing my math wrong,
but it's 300 gallons for 120 plants every
[SPEAKER_02]: other day because our bed has 160 plants
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two in a fraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to try to do that while I'm
talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading notes and trying to look at
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to do that much math.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that like a good solid eight to 10
hours of work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every day?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were there every single day from seven
o'clock until on a good day we got at
[SPEAKER_02]: four, four thirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus like a little bit of a drive because
it's not right in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's out in the county.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put everything out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's beautiful spots out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went for a drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a friend of mine to go see the
leaves change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to JB.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took her to go see the leaves change
colors out by toward the castle and we
[SPEAKER_03]: went to the castle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, we went before the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still raging.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, big shout out to all the people that
have to deal with those fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel so bad for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole vibe just changed when I thought
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we went out there and there are so if
you're paying attention, there are so many
[SPEAKER_03]: grows out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a grow every five miles off to the
left or the right side of the interstate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are super high tech and
fancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are a little jank,
but there are so many grows out there from
[SPEAKER_03]: from Pueblo to all the way into almost to
the castle.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a grow on Highway 96 to the left
or the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, if you got to take your
girlfriends out there or your significant
[SPEAKER_03]: other or your side chick or your boo,
you got to take them out on a road trip to
[SPEAKER_03]: go look at the leaves in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go drive up Highway 96 between Pueblo and
like Wetmore and then keep going even
[SPEAKER_03]: further up into Westcliff and look at all
of the grows on the left and right side of
[SPEAKER_03]: the inter on the highway while your girl's
looking at all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll enjoy it.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I want to talk about,
you started off in a basement grow like
[SPEAKER_03]: most growers do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start off in a tent like a lot of
growers do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Graduated to a basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen your pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You crush it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grew some Kalanji Kush that was
gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my favorites too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two of my favorite strains put
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tahoe, Gee and Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't really go wrong right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Swerve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got both those from Swerve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell was I going with this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some of the stuff that
you learned that is different,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you had to adjust major differences
you've noticed and learned going from like
[SPEAKER_03]: a small grow in your basement to this big
gigantic facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you had a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how many square feet that
greenhouse is?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've asked a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one seems to know for sure what it is,
but we have two flower rooms and in each
[SPEAKER_02]: flower room there is 640 plants and 20
gallons and or raised bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got raised beds and a couple of
raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you prefer the raised beds or the- Yes,
raised bed all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spencer seems to be loving those too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the Garden of Weed now in
Washington.
They're awesome.
They're so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's better about them?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just with the way we do them,
our raised beds are fed differently than
[SPEAKER_02]: we do our 20s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our 20s, we actually get the Mbesa compost
teas and we use those and we brew those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the raised bed, it's been no-till
and it's been going no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't added any soil to it other than
what goes in with the transplants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been like that since the opening of
the greenhouse, I think two years ago.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's full of life because we're all
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full of life, full of microbes and
it's just really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants seem, they get a little bit
bigger in the raised bed too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got more space for the roots to
get out and the flowers just always seem
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a little bit better out of the
raised bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really- We're trying to transition
into complete all raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping that life going in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk more about that when we get to
the next part here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk more about some of the stuff
that you had to change and that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed going to the Big Grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest I've ever had in my house is a
4K in the basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we've got, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 112 Gavitas in each room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got 224 lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going from four lights to 224 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just getting used to the size of the
plants and how often I got to water them
[SPEAKER_02]: and how much I got to water them really
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it was just basically,
it put into perspective how little I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually was doing at my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made my growing at home a lot easier,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a hobby grow now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wow, I used to think that
watering these 20 plants was hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, I got to water my 20
plants now, but now I'm watering 320 every
[SPEAKER_03]: day, doing maintenance on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking for bugs, making sure there's no
problems, putting supporting sticks
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere you need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, steak city.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an MED grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to make sure that everything is
tagged properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one thing that was really crazy
was going and getting, cause I had never
[SPEAKER_02]: done anything other than a basement grow
until I got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I never worked in any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been in the industry ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my badge and started working there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was one thing that was crazy
was seeing like how heavily, like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like everything has to be tagged,
tracked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you get rid of it, you have to
make sure that you like get rid of it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the computer and throw it in the right
basket and incinerate the basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that thing, that was really,
that was crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's overkill, but I like the overkill
kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps the, I feel like it keeps
everybody in check and it keeps the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that shouldn't be, shouldn't be doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps them kind of at bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates a standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can't live up to that standard,
then you shouldn't be growing this
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a medical product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, it's also a recreational product
for a lot of people, but I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational use is also medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that makes sense.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my, it's my freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my vice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't, I'm getting too old to go to
too many concerts and go do ridiculous
[SPEAKER_03]: shit and just take some dabs and play on
my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go with that for a minute sometimes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my, it's my recreational outlet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So man, 320 giant plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You defoliate that all your self pest
management, all yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of all, there's six of us that
work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six growers for, we have 1,280 plants and
flower and about 700 in veg, 400 in the
[SPEAKER_02]: T5s and another 600 clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And six of us manage that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we have our spray days
on Wednesday and Saturday and we've got,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I sent you that sprayer we had
that one time you saw that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the crazy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just have, everybody kind of
rotates how we, we spray, but we spray
[SPEAKER_02]: every, we spray two days a week all the
way through up until like the last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are, like I said, all organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're spraying 100% organic neem oil and
100% organic essentials.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no chemicals or nothing on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all, it's all food.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's kind of transition to that
part because that's something that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely noticed since you started
working at this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your home grow has completely switched to
fully organic now, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that inspired by this place?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was inspired by a few different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I started working there and
when I got in the grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watering my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I needed something to listen to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started listening to old podcast
episodes of yours that I hadn't listened
[SPEAKER_02]: to since I lived in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I figured, you know, I've learned a
couple of new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can take anything new from
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was listening to the episodes of
when Sean came on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, he really, he was so passionate
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, that was kind of cool to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh, he seems pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning about what I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also started hanging out with
Frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frosty organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's super passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was all like, you know,
he was throwing, dropping knowledge on me
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one day I just was like,
you know what, like I was going to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my outdoor going and I was like,
I'm going to do a raised bed, no-till
[SPEAKER_02]: organic outdoor for the summer and see how
much I like organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might switch to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was like, you know, why don't I
just completely go organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much, I feel like it's so much,
I know it's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just, you know, I know like it's,
it's just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made the switch completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that I've been doing it,
I've had one full complete like from,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I switched kind of halfway through a
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know what, I'm not going
to use these bottles anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm organic now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had plants and veg and then
plants halfway through flower went through
[SPEAKER_02]: that cycle of plants and veg came through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went through it, but I just now,
just like last week took down my first
[SPEAKER_02]: from seed to harvest, like 100% fully
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's by far the best, best girl I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to continue that path for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to eventually turn your
homegrown into no-till?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm doing no-till soil right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm reusing the soil that I have in
the pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using seven gallon pots and just
taking the root ball out and putting the
[SPEAKER_02]: two gallons in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to teach my listeners just
briefly a quick lesson on no-till?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't think we've covered too much
no-till on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say as much as I know, I'm by no
means an expert on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm new to this thing as well,
but it's a basically no-till soil is when
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a soil that you've amended
yourself and you've planted the plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just feed it top dressings and
whatever teas you want to do, whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got worms in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a lot of microbe life going in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's after three years, I believe that
you've been running the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never, you never actually like take
the soil up or put new soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You reuse the soil every time,
just taking the root ball out and putting
[SPEAKER_02]: a new plant in, reusing the old dirt,
trying to just a no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to irritate the land as little as
possible.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after three years, it's basically
self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you need to do is add water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the no-till is just, you've got a
lot of microbe life living in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a lot of microorganisms
breaking everything down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants are really really,
really going to thrive in a
[SPEAKER_02]: well-maintained no-till environment
because you're not really feeding your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're feeding these microorganisms that
live in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're going to absorb all these
things that you're feeding them,
[SPEAKER_02]: release them back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what your plants are going to
uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a cycle of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how things are meant to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just carefully maintaining it
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it allows the plant to eat what it
wants exactly the ratios.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not forced feeding it some bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not holding it down, putting a
nipple on a bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to show some formula in its mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how long does it take to,
can I almost take, if I grow a crop now
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not no-till, oh, cause it's not
amended.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I know the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to ask if I could take a plant
that I'm going to harvest tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_03]: chop the plant, pull the root ball out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I now start my no-till process with
that soil or do I need to pre-prep my pot
[SPEAKER_03]: at the beginning?
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably could, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would probably be best to start it
in an amended soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you, so that way, you know,
you've already got, your soil is already
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got life all the way from the top
to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you're just throwing a new plant
in there at that point, you're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just, it's going to be, it's going to take
a couple of weeks for it to take off
[SPEAKER_02]: really, because it's not going to have any
of the, there's no, there's no life in
[SPEAKER_02]: there to give it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to fire up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to get going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to create that life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to take off for probably a
week or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a great method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a great method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Lindsay, the traveling
stoner.
[SPEAKER_03]: She just called while we're trying to do a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lindsay, I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll call you back after we get done
recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was not live, but she definitely
listens to every episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll hear this part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what she wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what she wants to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: She got a new carb cap in that I'm excited
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, I think it's called a clit cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the shape of a vagina.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a carb cap and it looks like,
it looks like a vagina on the rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wants to take dabs and use dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where are we on my notes?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got distracted here.
[SPEAKER_03]: No-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like something that's
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just get a better, you feel more like,
it sounds cheesy, but you feel more in
[SPEAKER_02]: sync with your plants when you're like,
when you're controlling their environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did sort of, when Sean was here
often and we all got it, when I was being
[SPEAKER_03]: sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Worm
Company, big shout out to Jay from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company, they were
sponsoring me and they were actually
[SPEAKER_03]: giving me all of the amendments that I
needed to do everything organically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really loved my product and I loved,
I felt like a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had worm shit underneath my fingernails
and I've smelled like fish, fish emulsion
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was just funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a neem and kelp tea brewing in my
house right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm going to walk in the door and
it's going to just smell, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: smell that neem or that kelp meal as soon
as I walk in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love walking in and you've got the five
gallon bucket of tea brewing and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: foam three feet high off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like coming off the edge a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also, I ran at Green and Healthy,
we did nutrients that came out of big five
[SPEAKER_03]: gallon jugs into, I put them into
basically a beaker and then put those into
[SPEAKER_03]: a reservoir and mixed it and adjusted the
pH and I did it with like goggles on and
[SPEAKER_03]: gloves and it felt very scientific and I
liked that as well for some fun reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now at home I'm running on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like botanic care bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simple for what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I breed and so I don't need to do a lot of
crazy shit for what I'm breeding with and
[SPEAKER_03]: the botanic care is perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like mixing the bottles a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put some worm castings in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's organic amendments in the soil but
when it comes time to feed a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: I grab the bottles of botanic care.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be the easiest way for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I shift up so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a bunch of veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got veg bloom that'll probably go in
the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually noticed, I wanted to save
this for a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed that, we'll do an episode
about this, certain strains actually
[SPEAKER_03]: prefer certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed that if I, because I've ran,
I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ran so many nutrient lines and I've
had flow for 10 years and I've noticed
[SPEAKER_03]: that if I run flow with this brand,
it acts this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I run flow with this brand,
it acts this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different brands, because I've had the
same grow room set up for so long and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, they'll change from different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Syco made everything real colorful and
fluffy, but I hated the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Advanced nutrients made everything taste
exactly the same, but I got huge buds,
[SPEAKER_03]: but everything tasted exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Advanced might've been one of the
first brands I tried to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started with Mills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mills pays the bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen good work with Mills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the results that I was getting,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The organic is just, like I said,
it's more fun to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm doing more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to write no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I've grabbed this, I've got a pencil
dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually, it looks like a green
colored pencil and it's actually a glass
[SPEAKER_03]: dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just grabbed this to try to make a note.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to reach this way and not
look like a dumb ass and grab a pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll make a note.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a no-till episode in the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get Frosty on here for that one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Frosty live in Pueblo or Springs?
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he was a Springs kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frosty, why haven't you been on the
podcast, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get him out here for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Frosty, if you listen to this,
just text me or message me on Instagram or
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook right now and be like,
how do I get on your podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, I'll get Will to put me in
touch with you or I'll hit you up on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram and we'll get you on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about no-till because I'm sure
a lot of our listeners are like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know the recipe for the soil,
but we're going to tease them and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to make a listen to the no-till
episode for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys just got teased on two cool
episodes that are going to be coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are worms in there.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots, lots, lots of worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: How large is your raised bed?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing three by three or four by
four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is about three feet tall, but then it
goes like, oh, it's long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 40 plants in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes, there's a really, really,
really, really long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to ask how many worms are
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how many did you put in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they've been in there for,
we haven't had any new worms in forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've just been in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worms multiply pretty quickly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come down and check it out if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds great to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to come check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gone to enough big outdoor grows
this year for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll bring you guys some genetics or how
we can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were going to say earlier that you
got to label everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's got to be tagged by the MED.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't just grab a clone and drive
over there and be like, here's a clone you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have Capelton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd bring you some 31% test in genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be fun over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the next evolution if you go all
full no-till, then what's the next way to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve your garden after that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, once you're a no-till,
you know, you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You figure out some good top dress recipes
really just because I mean, by that point,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've got a full on no-till like,
I mean, Mountain Organics and everybody on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram really wants to see like some
really, I mean, this guy is where I
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered no-till from a couple of years
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I even knew what no-till was,
I was following this guy, Mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the tech down with the no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, once you've got it going for
like that many cycles, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really don't think there's much more
you can do other than just kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing if anything new comes out,
you know, if a new style or something
[SPEAKER_02]: comes out, just taking care of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: More phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that you use easy cloners at the
Big Grow when we were talking before the
[SPEAKER_03]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do those organics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OMRI, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Hormex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Hormex is an RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just started using this inoculant from
Mountain Organics actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is supposed to be the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually just started using that last
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told that inside of the clone X
dipping gel that I use for my cloner that
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a, excuse me for the throat
clearing, that there is a chemical called
[SPEAKER_03]: purple lavender dye, I think is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lavender, I think it's purple lavender
dye.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a friend of mine was like,
oh dude, don't use that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he saw it on my shelf and he's
actually, I don't know his degree,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he's got college degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he saw it, he's like,
no, you kind of freaked out on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, apparently clone X is a no go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to use that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He told me to get rid of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys do some research, that purple
velvet dye or purple crystalline velvet
[SPEAKER_03]: dye or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recall exactly, but if you Google
clone X, find the ingredients,
[SPEAKER_03]: that purple dye in there is supposed to be
really bad for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there's something in there that it's
really not good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get it on your hands and stuff,
it could definitely cause you some
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go do some research on clone X.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was asking Will how they do
it organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do most of our, we only use the
clone boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are like, we're trying to phase out
of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just have two of those right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our clones go into little root
rights that we have packed into little
[SPEAKER_02]: like one by one cubes with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some pro mix and then just a little like a
solution of RO aloe and then some,
[SPEAKER_02]: some humic acids from bioag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we dip those in the aloe and just
let those sit in the domes for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to love aloe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's on the aloe kick now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just using like liquid aloe or
powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we get just straight raw, cold pressed
aloe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dip the cutting in that, put it right
into the root riot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the, if you're putting it in your
water, I mean, you need this, just a
[SPEAKER_02]: small, finite amount of aloe goes a long,
long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for a whole 300 gallons, when we're
watering our plants, we use one ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just one ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a coffee cup, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a shot glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shot glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I went way bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are going to be thinking,
where can I get some powdered aloe?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not something, uh, if you've got a
recommendation, go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Build a soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you said it before I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not pay the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the place to go for that type of
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get powdered coconut water,
uh, powdered aloe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just go check out build a soil.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend that everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like, don't know anything about
organics and like, don't know where to go
[SPEAKER_02]: and need it's, but he's got everything you
need on there to start doing organically
[SPEAKER_02]: from like buying the supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he also has like, uh,
directions on how to clone, veg,
[SPEAKER_02]: flour, different top dress regimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got everything you need to know on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a real, real, real cool guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't checked out their website in a
little while, but yeah, I need to go check
[SPEAKER_03]: that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like they've updated a whole
bunch since I've done business with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they've got all your powder dry
organic amendments and they'll ship them
[SPEAKER_03]: to you everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're here in Colorado, Fort Collins,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The great prices, very affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're reasonable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you buy, the cheaper it gets
because they're powdered and they're bulk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they don't waste a lot of money on a
lot of packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're actually going to make a little
package up for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to weigh it there in their
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to ship out exactly what you
order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got great customer service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one time there was a weird,
something weird with my order.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered like two things on the same day
and wanted it to be in the same order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I emailed him and like, he personally
called me from like his cell phone and he
[SPEAKER_02]: got it worked out with me and got it all
shipped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No extra charge, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love, I love companies that do that kind
of stuff in the grow industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of companies that if they
make a mistake, they go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got your money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll either see you again or we won't
because we get plenty of business from
[SPEAKER_03]: plenty of other people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wrote down a whole bunch of notes,
but you wrote down a bunch of notes too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that we cover anything
that you wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shattered out frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frosty is a good dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see that dude often enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to make sure to give that dude a
huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get them on the show for no
till frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just come on the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, I guess the one thing I missed
here, uh, is the vortex brewers and
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation systems that I learned at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into, uh, brewing teas,
uh, combo season, everything, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the more agitation they get,
the better is how they, they brew faster
[SPEAKER_02]: and little, it's going to be a little
stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbes are going to be a little more
active and that they brew, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: more irrigated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just using air stones works,
but, uh, the vortex brewer, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, you know, it's a vortex that
spins inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three tubes and it spins the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really felt like a vortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll get, uh, I mean, you'll get a
tea brewing where you'll have bubbles
[SPEAKER_02]: popping up within minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like there's no extra Yuka in
there or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's just, it gets activated so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually seen guys clean out their
vortex brewer and put bubble bags in there
[SPEAKER_03]: and make hash in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's been so rapidly that they just
totally make hash with it in the off
[SPEAKER_03]: season.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you harvest and clean it out,
make some hash, then clean it out again
[SPEAKER_03]: and then put tea in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the irrigation system, what else were
you going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_02]: The irrigation systems are cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, I can never be able to run one at
my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, I'm like I said,
I run a 4k.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like at most 40 plants inside,
but, uh, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's, you know, I'm sure most people
know about them with their growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for those of you that don't,
it's a irrigation system is basically a
[SPEAKER_02]: self watering system that you put,
put a little emitter in each pot or down
[SPEAKER_02]: the line of the raised bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you turn on a motor and it just
sucks all the water out of the tank and
[SPEAKER_02]: gives each plant the exact same amount of
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cuts the watering time from like an
hour and a half to about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the time it takes you to build that
system saves you so much time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been telling all of the listeners
that we're going to talk about building a
[SPEAKER_03]: watering system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just teased it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got it halfway written.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've got about halfway written.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of very specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for your needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a guideline written.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll, we'll put that out pretty soon
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can record that one and like,
it'll take me less than an hour or so to
[SPEAKER_03]: sit down and do that one night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So guys, that one's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: How to build your own irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if you've got eight plants or
108 plants or 800 plants, I think an
[SPEAKER_03]: irrigation system could be very useful for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it sometimes when I'm away,
I'm like, Oh God, I want to just go home
[SPEAKER_03]: and check on the plants and see if they're
dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to go home and check on the
plants and see if they're dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I, when I had the larger grow,
I just want to, I would go to Denver for
[SPEAKER_03]: shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the way back, I would stop to grow
and check on the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how a CDI was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause some shit can go wrong sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will clog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually your, your watering system is
going to clog up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to mess with it,
but we'll talk about building one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how many plants you're running,
it can definitely save you a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you don't have a lot of room
to walk in the, like if you want to blow
[SPEAKER_02]: out of room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I'm six foot five and in a
residential grow lights hanging about,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, probably they're,
they're about six foot down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, walking through stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'd leave people like,
what's with the walkway?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not growing cement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, we're going to be as big as
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I put my dreads in a giant bun
and now I'm like seven feet tall at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, it's, I'm fun in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't wear too baggy of clothes
because I get hung up on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could shrink up a little bit
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to be this, this gigantic look
like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you shout it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frosty, Frosty, we want to get you on the
show, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some no-till stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some no-till stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've talked about your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about you moving, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you came out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we made good friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I came out here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've both got a kind of blondish,
almost slightly ginger reddish hair,
[SPEAKER_03]: big freaking Viking beers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We both showed up barefoot and we made
good friends, made great friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, since you're on a microphone,
dude, and you got free reign of the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's talk about what you're going to do
next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, you got any huge plans for the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, me and a buddy of mine just bought
some property, um, down south,
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple, about five acres of land and,
uh, coast to your County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, filling out some permits and stuff
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, we'll see where it takes us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just getting some stuff done out there
and barefoot farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping to get a little barefoot,
a barefoot ranch, barefoot farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: get a couple of hoop houses or something
going on out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a pretty prime, pretty prime
little, little plot of land to do it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty soon you'll be opening them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open up some coffee shops or bowling alley
or bowling alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of some inside jokes between us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some funny shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys get some coffee shops,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always a good investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Invest in coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just random stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't invest in coffee shops and be
mad when, when you don't make the money
[SPEAKER_03]: that you thought you were going to make.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of being, being facetious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been going for like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of my listeners kind of dip out
around 36 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, man, thanks for joining us on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you had me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, it was a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take some dabs here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some, uh, you guys are going to
laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I've got some Blue Dream Shatter that
is pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we just had the last of the Blue
Dream Shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just took the last couple dabs of Blue
Dream Shatter and it made us chatty and it
[SPEAKER_03]: made us have a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to the Blue Dream Shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause if you know me, you know how I feel
about Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashtag Fuck Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to grow Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to smoke Blue Dream flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to see Blue Dream at the
dispensary, but that somebody was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, I got some Blue Dream Shatter for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was actually, it did a damn good
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have a big smile on my face over.

cannabis, this my friends is the podcast

turps.

[SPEAKER_03]: He's got 44 on there and sometimes there's
a dude named fetus that hangs out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, who else has been on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, tater tater.
[SPEAKER_03]: What up tater?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually mentioned tater yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard from that dude in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he in Colorado again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's up tater?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to get together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I owe you a high five and a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to hang out, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to tater.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen to the podcast and two
episodes in a row, you got, you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: mention, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so Jesse's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, something I got to mention you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know I'm going to get a whole
bunch of fucking messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said the wrong episode number at the
start of the last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not have any notes in front of me
with the episode number written on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I normally do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote it down this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I did have to clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the best we could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please stop with the tweets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I said the wrong number.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for trying to keep me on the right
path.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so before we hit record here,
uh, Jesse, we, we like to hang out before
[SPEAKER_03]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get nice and medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get into a talking little zone here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse's kind of been on a, on a cleanse,
hasn't been taken a lot of dads,
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't been consuming a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he took the first dab,
I watched him get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of neat to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a big dude and I just watched him
kind of melt a little bit after the first
[SPEAKER_03]: dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he brought over some liquid SFV,
some San Fernando Valley, OG Kush Terps,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and some Durban poison wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I dunked a dab of, what am I smoking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Jack flash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dunked a dab of Jack flash into the
Terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was Terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might be my word.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be the only one that says
Terpadelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Webster's new word of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Webster's new actionary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, we were talking before the show,
as I was mentioning, uh, we're getting
[SPEAKER_03]: nice and roasted and medicated,
taking dads off the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and Jesse was telling me that he went
to Oregon and he was actually ballsy
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to take his medicine on the plane
with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tell it, tell everybody what you
traveled on a plane with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some live res, some, this is going
to sound ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took live res, water hash, rosin,
uh, some flour, a little bit of clear,
[SPEAKER_00]: some Terps, and, um, a couple of the
doctor's orders made paint cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a rig with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And two rigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much everything, but a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew not to take a torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot take the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll take the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very similar to a bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already a bomb essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't, they don't want that on the
plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the rigs were in a locked,
uh, case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I, I put the rigs in my check-in
baggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all the product though, I kept it on
my purse or in my carry-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was backsealed and then in a Ziploc
baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I took my med card and a copy of
my driver's license and put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the first thing they would see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they totally went through my bag and
it went through the x-ray scanner and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I flew there and back with,
with it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody gave you any harassment at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to enjoy your medical marijuana
while you were in the great state of
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flew out of a different airport.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like you had a great vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the, what was your favorite part?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, getting to see my, uh, best friend
from high school and lifelong buddy get
[SPEAKER_00]: married to a woman he is absolutely crazy
about was very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the Oregon coast is just
absolutely unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend checking it out to the
new, uh, to the new married couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they listened to a
podcast, but shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And either way, the energy is out in the
air now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, dude, I'm glad you're back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to get you on for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been a busy dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a, uh, a new job there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about how many plants you
run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will was on yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will was running, uh, I think he said 640
plants is what I think he said on his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're talking and you're running,
you've got beds of 500 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sections of 500 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody's been killing it with the
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, uh, basically I've had,
I've ran little med shop grows and now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: in a big, yeah, it's a lot of fucking
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying earlier that it took you
all day to cut, uh, three to 400 clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, there were people that would
probably, they probably heard that they
[SPEAKER_03]: went, shit, man, I could probably cut a
thousand clones today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of grade A, you know, perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chosen right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfectly chosen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said that you don't keep mother
plants that you take the clones off the
[SPEAKER_03]: veg plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to run through the veg area
with a cup or a container of water and get
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts, gather them up and then go back to
the cloning area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consult back with the, with the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to look at the schedule of stuff
that's already been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to look at the stuff that is
going to be before it so that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a specific program to harvest four
strains a week out of our 16 strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we always have X strain on hand
and to keep in track with all of that also
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot of work, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's things that people don't think
about is trying to keep the variety coming
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently because in a grow,
you're going to want to put, let's do this
[SPEAKER_03]: whole row of sour diesel per se,
just because you want that whole row.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when it comes time to put it on
the shelf, now you've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody comes to the dispensary to
buy product, we're going to shoot ton of
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's all you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see, we're a wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dispensary buyer comes to us and
you know, we got a whole bunch of sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's bomb, you know, they're
probably just going to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the big reasons we have
to have a huge variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need that 31 flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what keeps them coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could probably, if you could
probably sell 10 pounds of that sour
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel, but if you had five other strains,
you could probably sell seven pounds of
[SPEAKER_03]: each one of them just because of the
variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So variety is king.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't think about what it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking a little bit about it on
the show about commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't think about what it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to hear you come in and talk
about just scheduling the clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it starts at the clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to schedule the clones to know
what your variety is going to be in about
[SPEAKER_03]: 120 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's more like 90 for, for my
situation, but yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: still it's, yeah, it's planning
preparation and then everything you do,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is something that I got sidetracked
on when I was talking with Will,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything you do has to be documented in
metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much if your scissors touch a
plant, you have to open up a computer and
[SPEAKER_03]: make a note somewhere in the damn computer
that something happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one person spends 40 hours a week
doing nothing but that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This Mac book on a cart, which was
actually a trash can with a piece of wood
[SPEAKER_03]: on top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I had a trash can on wheels and I
pushed around to water one of the smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like for water and small plants,
I put a board on top of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the Mac book on top of there and that
was my metric station.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll that around and just do my metric
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just made 900 clones of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just harvested this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you cut off, so there are varying
different, different compliance officers
[SPEAKER_03]: will tell you different rules on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you cut off something on a plant,
it needs to be weighed and documented in
[SPEAKER_03]: metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to go to that plant tag number.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to say, I manicured 0.4 grams off
of plant number 90555.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to show on camera that
you destroyed the part that was manicured
[SPEAKER_03]: off the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's very tedious in metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very tedious.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about dabs on a plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse got away with taking a shoot on a
plane and he looks like an ogre too,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they didn't even mess with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we talked about your new grow
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about what we brought you here
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main topic that you, when we talked on
Facebook, you're like, I want to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about reminding people to clean up their
grow space after the outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you want to tell us about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that is a super good topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it depends on how you grow,
I guess, but you know, I'm an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of homestead style is a term.
[SPEAKER_03]: A real farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a term I've been using lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked it up from a person in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should give that person a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you mention the podcast to them at
all?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't even have internet,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hippie Mary.
[SPEAKER_00]: She lived on the coast down the road from
the place I was staying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's normally not like me to go
out and just randomly start talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: strangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason I, uh, there were some
huge tomato plants in her yard that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of attracted me to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ended up making a friend out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the true farmer in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tomato plants are done in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been harvested and eaten by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she had tomatoes up there and Jessie
was like, Ooh, that's rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, that's a, I told her how she
grows or how I grew because she actually
[SPEAKER_00]: had a couple of plants out back too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I told her how I grew and she
called me a homestead farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, or homestead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of like that term.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels good for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but my situation, I've got living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've got a whole bunch of plant waste,
the leaves, the stocks, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've taken all of that and run it
through a chipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, into the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so by next, you know, summer,
that will be nice black compost and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you know, all the nutrients that
were still in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the, this will be the third
year we've done this, but it just all goes
[SPEAKER_00]: right back into the system again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I mulched up my soil real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watered it down real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I've got it covered with plastic
to store it over the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, is that going to make a nice,
uh, mycelium layer happen in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get some funk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, when you start seeing a lot of
people see that white fuzz, they'll make
[SPEAKER_03]: some super soil or they'll make some
compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they see that white fuzz and they
freak out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're working for.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That white fuzz is magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to make all the shit
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get your compost pile covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got all that handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the plastic is good for several
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, it helps insulate the soil,
um, on really cold days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on really cold days, it's,
it's going to get cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on days when it warms up and then it
cools off again, it can, the warmer the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil stays, the more breakdown happens,
the more healthy it stays alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it protects it from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It protects it from getting blown away,
drying out and blowing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the pressure stops oil off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then also something I've noticed
last year is it keeps the damn
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood cats from, uh, neighborhood
cats love to, uh, piss and do their thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in your, uh, in your nice, fresh garden
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it keeps them away too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cats probably helps keep the birds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possibly birds wouldn't be so bad,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, chicken shit into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that goes into the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just all returns back to the,
do you use a Bokashi bucket at home?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pour that Bokashi bucket right into
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have another use for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, normally I put it in the compost pile
or I'll just bury it directly in one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but here lately I'm going to go ahead
and compost it inside after it's done in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put it in a little miniature tumbler
I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that'll be to redo or make it less
acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I'm going to feed it to my
new worm inside worm bins.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You and Spencer both doing worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, barefoot's doing worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's going worm life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see everybody doing the
worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, have you tried to use the stuff from
your Bokashi bucket, the drainage that
[SPEAKER_03]: they call it the leachate, that stinky
foot smell and juice that comes out of
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if you have a clogged drain or that
shit right down the drain, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, probably two ounces down to clog drain
and it'll dissolve.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got like a hair clog, or whatever's
in there, it'll, I've got these dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_03]: down to my fucking knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get some hair clogs in the drain,
the shower, just pour that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll clean it right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll stink.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to pour it in there, let it soak
all through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it like an hour and then just go
run the hot water, kind of push it down
[SPEAKER_03]: and get rid of the smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it eats it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember you told me you, uh, cleaned a
clone machine with it once too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put that in the corner and let it
run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It eats up all the basically dissolves all
the, uh, that funky layer that the cloner
[SPEAKER_03]: gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets covered in calcium and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys take good care of your cloners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a cloner, uh, since I didn't clean
it out good enough, it got clogged up and
[SPEAKER_03]: fried itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about compost piles.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally set.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to sidetrack you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing on that, uh, on the Bokashi
liquid that is basically, I've been told
[SPEAKER_00]: this from two people that really know
their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically EM1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's like great white shark,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using EM1 all summer and I,
I've been getting it from a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been making it myself and I'm out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the last couple of weeks,
I've just been using Bokashi bucket juice
[SPEAKER_00]: when I normally would use the EM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see no noticeable changes,
good or bad.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than the, uh, the, uh, rotting trash
can became foot smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like a bar dumpster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has food too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That somebody threw up in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're composting all of your stocks,
all of your big leaves that aren't usable
[SPEAKER_03]: for any product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's all going into the compost
pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chicken shit's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All your food waste that you've been
eating all the time goes into your Bokashi
[SPEAKER_03]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're making fertilizer out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gets buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our soil covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the soil covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually, if you're, you know,
I'm not necessarily no till where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you can go ahead and actually ream
in now and put all your amendments you
[SPEAKER_00]: would put in in the spring and it just
makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of that old root ball do I need
to get out of there before I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave all of it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You leave it all to just chop the stick
and then kind of dig another hole later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you keep the soil wet and active
throughout the winter and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the early spring, there will be no
root ball when you come back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it dry out and you don't cover
it, the root ball will still very much be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it moist and the earth will eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reassimilate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn it back into food.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can re-amend now in the winter and
that stuff will hopefully re-it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: colonize and keep producing itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll have even more potent soil
by the time it's time to go outdoors.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then at that point, the only
things I would add in would just be like
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp and alfalfa things that are,
they're going to break down all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through to where, you know, there's
basically none left for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, go ahead and I really
stumbled all over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plant, go ahead and do like a
mycorrhizae inoculant and then add a
[SPEAKER_00]: little kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when you're planting them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little alfalfa to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready to roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk more about that in later
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely going to record a whole
bunch of outdoor episodes for next year so
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've got them prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were both so busy this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These big commercial grows keep us on our
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My summer next year is looking to be even
busier.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you already know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it's only a few months away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's after November,
we'll know if it's going to happen or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just waiting until then,
but we have an outlet and this is a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother outfit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an outline, we have property,
they have licensing, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting to pull the trigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you seem to get involved in
seems to take off and get a good launch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure it's going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, yeah, if I stumble into all
these startups, it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're a guy that can get shit done
and people need somebody like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grow store doesn't hurt either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to grow and I know how,
I know how to do things, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: as much on how to get shit done as you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need a guy like you to fucking build
the walls and build the tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you get the tables built and
I can come in and build the watering
[SPEAKER_03]: system and run the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're on the move and I'm on
the move.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we rerun it a few times and they
decided we need to remodel and rebuild.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so call Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a few months off and go
somewhere else and Jesse come rebuild and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come back and regrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll just keep playing dance around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go build shit, I'll grow, go grow at
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a man on the move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll get you growing outdoors this
summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my backyard fence is three feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm talking like 3,500 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, let's go get a sunburned game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been albino for long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we'll work in the shade of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow them tall enough where I can be
shaded under them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, Jesse mentioned, he said,
we will wait till November to decide if
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an election coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may get a president that doesn't want
medical cannabis or recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may might put a kibosh on some of our
plans, but more locally, what Jesse is
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about, we have amendment 200 and
amendment 300 here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if those pass, the marijuana industry
in Pueblo, Colorado will be forced to shut
[SPEAKER_03]: down in the year 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get a full year to keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after that, it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: No new licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like these people, even though they
have a license, they've never grown
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a change of location for
them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under the new proposal, they wouldn't
be able to let it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys, it's probably going to be
too late by the time this episode comes
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you voted, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a huge shout out to Mike,
to white Mike, Nemo Punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything he's done, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been putting huge efforts in for the
No On 200 campaign, the No On 300
[SPEAKER_03]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did more groundwork than anybody else I
saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to everybody else that
participated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm giving Mike all the credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a bunch of you,
but Mike is a person that led it in my
[SPEAKER_03]: eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there are more of you, but Mike is
one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw him doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He owes a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can name a few more names, but I can't
name them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of people I know that
deserve a shout out, but I don't exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: know their names, but I know they're on
Mike's team.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike, spread the love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them know they're getting shout outs
from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for what you do, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get you on a podcast here
in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be on every damn show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to white Mike and the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you guys are having fun on the couch
this evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a warm fall Saturday evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 80 degrees in my house because
we expected winter to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I covered up my swamp cooler because it
was cold the other night.
[SPEAKER_03]: The air was coming in there and freezing
me when I was trying to watch Narcos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an excellent show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, I hate the way it ended.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, there will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do a Cali cartel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which isn't nearly as exciting,
but it'll still be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an attachment to that show.
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 episodes was not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love anything drug smuggling culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just eat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a few books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched every documentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dude, the big Lebowski, will be at The
Chronic Con in Colorado here coming up
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go meet him and take your picture
with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke a J with the dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a J with the dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get a little bit back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we finished up talking about
cleaning the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got it kind of re-amended for next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've filled it with some kelp and some
alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when it comes time for season,
we're going to dig a little hole and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to put some mycorrhizas in there,
some more kelp, some more alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe some crab meal, maybe some worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just worms themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worms themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you guys get the worms going.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worms are so good for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the compost pile,
by all means, use it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that in your holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds so gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that in the holes where you're
planting your plants so that all that rich
[SPEAKER_03]: compost can feed those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're grown in pots, you can
still utilize that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're using salt-based chemical
nutrients, you can still utilize that
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the trend that I'm seeing on
Instagram and social media and even the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're recycling soil and running no-till
and you're seeing them top dress and
[SPEAKER_03]: decorate their plants to keep a layer in
there to where they can keep the moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're putting stuff like alfalfa sprouts
and other sprouts on top of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm loving the way that it looks in a nice
indoor garden with this other growth on
[SPEAKER_03]: top of your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a little ecosphere on top of your
plant there and then you got a pot plant
[SPEAKER_03]: growing out of it and that little shit
that's growing out of it is dying and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually feeding your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a neat little thing to learn and
see happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a miniature environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that permaculture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that'd be no-till, which is a
permaculture value, but permaculture is
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to wrangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a way of looking at things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned something today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's keep ourselves on track.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's chipped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put some stuff where the old plants
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: What should we focus on other than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning up your trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grow has got a little bit,
whether it's beer bottles or old netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pepper bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zigzag wrappers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all that shit cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your cages put away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use those, if you're netting or
whatever, get that all put up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to reuse it next year,
you need to store it away and get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with your water barrels, your air
pumps, any kind of liquid nutrients you
[SPEAKER_00]: had outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get all that inside and in a
warm place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bring it inside to your grow area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bring the bugs and mildew into your
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it in the shed outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take some time and clean it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just polish it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had a fan or something outside,
take it apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it with some H2O2 or some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the same thing, but the 30%
hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it with some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing will clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even like enzymes complete or hygrosime
or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some of the Bokashi juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean your stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use what's at your disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bronner's soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that with some pine oil or
something like that in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to kill anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Dr. Bronner's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wash my dreads with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can wash everything with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so clean up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out there and clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take all the equipment out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it look like there was never a grow
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow in pots and you want to reuse
all your soil, even if you're growing pots
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not reusing your soil,
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had any issues, they're still
lingering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to reuse it, get it all
in a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover it with plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same principle we were talking
about with covering the raised beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had some fungus gnats or powdery
mildew, is that going to be destroyed in
[SPEAKER_03]: the composting process or is that going to
compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats, if you get the pile heated
up enough, which means you've got to add a
[SPEAKER_00]: considerable amount of raw green material
and just organic matter for it to heat
[SPEAKER_00]: back up, it will most definitely kill the
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we might be killing ourselves trying
to do both because I think if you put the
[SPEAKER_03]: green in there, the PM will grow on the
green, but I don't think the PM can grow
[SPEAKER_03]: on things that are not leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, green matter could even be
or like green manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be cow shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything that's going to heat
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass clippings, if you feel safe.
Old pot leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old pot leaves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean- Chicken poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicken poop is just such a great
amendment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's funny that I say that
because I'm a vegetarian and I don't even
[SPEAKER_03]: eat the chickens, but I've noticed that
when chicken poop goes into a compost,
[SPEAKER_03]: goes into plants, it really does
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then seabird poop also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any sort of seabird poop, anything from
the sea is really, really rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way sea stuff grows.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why that California kush smells so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea gannics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ever had to label the way I like to
grow, you know, that's sea gannics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to edit that out so nobody
steals that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that might be a phrase you want
to- No, because there may be someone on
[SPEAKER_00]: the coast that's like way more worthy of
using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some girl around the coast that wants to
make some sea-based- But you better be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting like your own kelp and your own
bird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Swim out to the ocean with some buckets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Impress me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably illegal as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not hear that here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kelp laying all over the beach in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably going to get in trouble if
you collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure people wouldn't mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it, put it in some bottles and ship
the first test your batches to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinse all the salt off first, please.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just see the plants just- What did
you do to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to rinse the kelp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are way off topic, but we are still on
topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I deal with every year
and I fucking did it this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean out your outdoor spray bottles
because like mine have teas go through it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a lot of glasses and they always
clog up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the spring, I'm just like
motherfucker and end up throwing it away
[SPEAKER_00]: and going and getting a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pump it and you go to spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned them all out with super hot
water this year and good to go for next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys buy the pump sprayers that have
the nozzle on it where you can release the
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be able to release that
pressure because otherwise you'll pump it
[SPEAKER_03]: up real hard and the fucking the nozzle
will get stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll never get it off of there and now
you can't refill it and then you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: just throw it away because you'll try to
pop it open with something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to break it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the plastic somewhere will spin or
trust me, get the kind of the type that
[SPEAKER_03]: have the pressure release valve so you can
once it's pumped up and pressurized,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can take that pressure off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really scary trying to undo it when
you got like neem oil in there and you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want it to spray up in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that happen with someone that had a
tank full of fluoromite once like a
[SPEAKER_00]: backpack tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're pumping it, pumping it,
and they didn't have the lid screwed on
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was back before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, lots of people knew better but we
didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back before we knew that fluoromite was a
no-go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you got to do something,
if you get a brand new clone and it came
[SPEAKER_03]: from somebody and you really, really want
it but it might have something to hit it
[SPEAKER_03]: if you need to, but mother that out and
take clones from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go smoking the fluoromited one.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least try to get a generation from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we've cleaned up everything
we've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to cover up the holes for the area
for next year or do you just want to leave
[SPEAKER_03]: it exposed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that covered up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cover that up so that all the stuff
can process in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some heat in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your compost pile going.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got everything cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't even look like a grow happened
in that yard or that field anymore,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make it look nice and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's a clean slate for you to go
back next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as soon as the snow melts and
you're thinking about growing,
[SPEAKER_03]: the next thing to do is go out there and
fix all of the holes in your fences and go
[SPEAKER_03]: check that fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go make sure that that thing is super
secure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go pick up all of the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure your dog or one of your buddy's
dogs have been out there dropping deuces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go pick that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want all the flies coming around
because of dog poop out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it gets warm, that's the stuff
you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how serious you get,
I know of a couple of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: already growing their plants for next
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a small 25, 35 plant or less
outdoor grow, you can start your plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: February probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from seed and you want
to do a phenose selection, I suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: starting now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing from clones,
February, you can start them up if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going for trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start them up, get them huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let them get root bound ever,
ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they will start to flower on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will start flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, veg them inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them loved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let them get root bound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep them pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, keep them pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not run them on a 24-hour light unless
you plan on putting them outside
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath a 24-hour light.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I would have never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you got a hoop house and you
can run a little, all it takes is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do that, go for 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, running them 24 and
then putting them outside under not 24,
[SPEAKER_00]: it either stunts them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativas, it will throw them into bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicas, it will throw them into bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you get two weeks of going into bloom
and then going back into veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then vegging and then going back into
flower and then you got plants that just
[SPEAKER_03]: look like hell and they're mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a very funky looking plant at
the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your trimmers hate you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else that we should
mention when it comes to cleaning up your
[SPEAKER_03]: garden at the end of the season to prepare
for the winter and the next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing major.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have locks on gates or something
like that, put them inside unless they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just keeps them from, at least
around here, it keeps them from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested up and crap like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a lot of the things I do is so
that I don't have to spend money on it the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that my tools last all summer,
you know, first several years,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just one season at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of that comes with age or
getting older for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting tired of buying the same
damn hammer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did I put that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I left it out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you get that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially around here, because if you
leave it somewhere, it's fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get a chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll almost take the shit out of your
hand if you blink long enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I did not mean to bash this town,
but fuck, dude, drugs are bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, drugs are real bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the town north of us has the other
drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the drug that makes you go real
slow and sleepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then up north, they got the ones that
are making you go real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just fucking ridiculous all over
the place lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's fucking flipping out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, that looks like such a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, Jesse's taking a big fat dab of
some Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Task Rock and the E-Nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cough it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it's my turn to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse, do you have any final words for the
podcast you want to put out to the
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to One Love Garden Supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come check us out Denver or Boulders,
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just took a big dab and then I put
them on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: My fault, my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the awesome people in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's something I meant to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Customer service out there is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so nice.
Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't seem like they're mad at you
for wanting a sandwich at the sandwich
[SPEAKER_03]: place?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually glad to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in super small little podunk towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we had a great customer service
experience out there, I would think of
[SPEAKER_00]: your rants on Facebook about how horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, he's fucking
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go somewhere that actually
they're like, hey, welcome to our
[SPEAKER_03]: establishment where you're going to pay
our wages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we help you properly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh shit, they know about
service here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad you got taken care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all the nice people on the
coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an awesome, awesome experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to your wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to your wife for letting you go
on that adventure and for also hooking me
[SPEAKER_03]: up every time I go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_03]: She takes really good care of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can send her a Facebook message and let
her know what I need.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I get there, it's on the damn counter
waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: She makes life very easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Bern.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out my podcast, Colorado podcast at
Facebook or on Facebook as Colorado

[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually done a crossover episode
where the Colorado boys came here and
[SPEAKER_03]: invaded my studio and acted a fool for an
hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to do a new one with our new
format.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you've got a new format.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: More, more comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Less cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you ever need an outlet for your
cannabis talk, I've got a microphone that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're always invited to come ramble into.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take you up on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys make sure you follow my buddy,

[SPEAKER_01]: Would you recognize it if I jumped up and
bit you on the eye?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you recognize it if I jumped up and
bit you on the eye?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw that I was like for measuring
each beat gets 20 counts That was one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those stories that came through right
before the election that I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: thank god There's some some people out
there that are willing to do shit Insane
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to make the press to just change
the topic conversation even for a minute
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I can still see you trying to
wrap your head around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I remembered the stories Just a
couple cool ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they just gonna count 20 beats on the
bottom?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they gonna break it down to like a
basic like Five or four or five or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we'll figure this out I just did it
in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went one two, three, four five six
That's just a rock beat for 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, this went way too far All
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a while back.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a continuing story ongoing
story ongoing story a long time ago It
[SPEAKER_03]: feels like this feels like it happened in
damn forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took it happened in May of 2015 to be
more precise Which in a pot had mine like
[SPEAKER_03]: mine that was damn forever back when we
learned not to watch movies on the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so there was a raid in the city
of Santa Ana Yes, the the police
[SPEAKER_03]: department came in and destroyed the
dispensary they illegally raided the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary they came in they destroyed the
dispensary They needlessly destroyed a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of TVs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They destroyed the cash register.
[SPEAKER_03]: They destroyed this display counters They
basically vandalized the shit out of this
[SPEAKER_03]: place imagine if a bunch of teenagers
broke into somewhere and were pissed Off
[SPEAKER_03]: and just wanted to fuck shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they did in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, and in the process they also stole
and consumed cannabis infused edibles
[SPEAKER_03]: while on the clock while conducting a raid
slash investigation while in possession of
[SPEAKER_03]: a firearm while taxpayer money was paying
their salary while illegally conducting a
[SPEAKER_03]: raid of a legally functioning operating
facility as far as I'm concerned that's
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly what the security video shows
Unfortunately, most of that wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually proved in the court of law The
fallout from this has been a year or more
[SPEAKER_01]: in the making It looks like they're
finally done with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of the officers that are
portrayed in the video His main
[SPEAKER_01]: characters, let's say the the nasty female
cop Who says she was gonna kick the
[SPEAKER_01]: one-legged old woman who was volunteering
at the dispensary quote in her fucking nub
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then the cop that was handing
out snack foods And the other cop that was
[SPEAKER_01]: eating snack foods all have resigned And
the city's now paying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the total?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay City of Santa Ana will pay one
hundred thousand dollars to sell a lawsuit
[SPEAKER_01]: over infamous dispensary Raid yes of
taxpayer money and if I remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: article right that money is getting split
up three ways Between two of the main
[SPEAKER_01]: volunteers in the dispensary and then
legal counsel basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good business plan It's it's not
a bad way to disperse the settlement as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as I can tell it's I'm glad that the
city got hit with this though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's dispensary raids all over the
place This raid was clearly out of line
[SPEAKER_01]: from beginning To end and it should have
cost the police some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should it should sing Totally
unacceptable from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how I found out about that news
article me on Twitter Mike sent it to me

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes It was a stressful couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a stressful man.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Hey guys on Facebook, can we all just
shut the fuck up and be friends again?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all we're all in this together if

[SPEAKER_03]: and just be friends again on Facebook
Let's go posting cat pictures again,
[SPEAKER_01]: please It's been highly contentious for I
mean, man, I've been actively working this
[SPEAKER_01]: election since April I just just Wrapping
my own head around that hurts Mike I give
[SPEAKER_03]: you a shout out on an episode that I don't
know if it is aired yet Do you and Jesse
[SPEAKER_01]: episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard and appreciated that you guys are
awesome Face-to-face man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you because you came on here I all
the listeners owe you a shout out you came
[SPEAKER_03]: on here and Kind of reminded us several
times go fucking vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's thanks, dude That's the first
takeaway from last night's election it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a weird way to jump into to the
main topic tonight, but really You you you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to vote That's I mean, it's the one
thing that we all do as Americans other
[SPEAKER_01]: than pay taxes and die There really unites
all of us under the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got right here one of my notes It's
the one on the bottom, but I'm gonna ask
[SPEAKER_03]: it first since you're here Do you feel
like your vote made an actual difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Look at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's there's a million
different ways to rationalize I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: vote because my vote didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you actually pull up The numbers
look at your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the different races Thousands and
thousands and thousands of people voted in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of these races I mean even here in
Pueblo races around the country come down
[SPEAKER_01]: to 30 votes a hundred votes Pueblo
Colorado has been a strong Democratic They
[SPEAKER_01]: call it a Democratic stronghold back when
Colorado was a hard Republican state
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver and Pueblo were Republican or
Democratic in a thick Republican state and
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean for 40 years Pueblo has been a
Democratic stronghold and in this election
[SPEAKER_01]: Trump won by like 240 votes And literally
the our vote for president down here was
[SPEAKER_01]: decided by 240 votes a couple of the
county commissioner seats Which would
[SPEAKER_01]: directly impact both of our lives and any
number of things locally were decided by a
[SPEAKER_01]: few hundred votes a few thousand votes And
this is nationally when you look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff If you look at the polling data from
this election, if Gary Johnson wasn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing The conversation we're about to have
tonight would be very different Gary
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnson running and the little tiny
percent of the vote he got changed vote
[SPEAKER_01]: results all across the country And that
changed the outcome of the election in
[SPEAKER_01]: major major ways right there it's not just
president it's So easy to I don't like the
[SPEAKER_01]: two candidates that the main parties put
forward for president.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not voting Just because you don't like
the president You just gave up all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions on your Senate senators your
House of Representatives members your
[SPEAKER_01]: local election elect Politicians your
local election issues your local ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, right and a lot of those are
really important of those I didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: how important they were to me until I got
my ballot and discovered that I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh shit This needs to be voted on when I
first started going through what was
[SPEAKER_01]: finally gonna be on this elections ballot
here in Colorado I was like, what the fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: slavery?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not to yell into the microphone,
but we literally voted on abolishing
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially indentured servitude or
slavery in Colorado's penal system last
[SPEAKER_01]: night If I if I caught that vote right we
voted to end being able to force prisoners
[SPEAKER_01]: to work while they're in jail It's an
option not not something you have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: for we throw you in isolation or beat you
or don't feed you or whatever Which is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of nuts that that's what we were
doing beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you see that on the ballot,
you're like, wow I've heard so much about
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillary and I've heard so much about
Donald and I've heard so much about Gary,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've heard nothing about we still have
slavery here Marijuana was on the vote in
[SPEAKER_01]: nine states Yesterday, that's another
subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to hit I was gonna segue to that
That's that's our main our main focus of
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight's election is or tonight's Podcast
is the election basically and how it
[SPEAKER_01]: relates to marijuana I've been on here a
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even tell you how many times
talking about different marijuana votes
[SPEAKER_01]: this election locally and nationally And
so this is the wrap-up episode for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome Locally we can just Brush this out
of the way for those of you who have been
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting on pins and needles to figure out
if I still have a job I do 200 and 300
[SPEAKER_03]: failed here in Pueblo So on the on the
ballot were initiatives to pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: dismantle and shut down the recreational
and medical Cannabis industries in the
[SPEAKER_03]: city and county of Pueblo, Colorado if
this initiative were to have passed there
[SPEAKER_03]: would be no more Growing then you're
processing which is hash making and edible
[SPEAKER_03]: making They would have gotten rid of all
of the regulated and licensed businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: all the retail stores would have been gone
How many people were employed by that
[SPEAKER_03]: industry 1300 is the low ballpark number?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, 1300 people would not have had jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortunately enough people did go out and
vote That's part of what gives me faith
[SPEAKER_01]: that my vote counted because I of course
voted One of almost like five thousand and
[SPEAKER_01]: change the almost seven thousand and
change Both yes and no on these questions
[SPEAKER_01]: got over 20,000 votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Literally every vote counted this
election every door that got knocked
[SPEAKER_01]: mattered Had we not done the work that we
did on this these two issues this vote
[SPEAKER_03]: could easily gone the other way I'm glad
that the other team kind of started
[SPEAKER_03]: floundering at the end there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ran a very bizarre campaign I don't
really want to get into the ins and outs
[SPEAKER_01]: of our local fight and why we won but
thank God we won but it was a weird
[SPEAKER_01]: election here in Pueblo, too we So
questions 200 and 300 were voting to ban
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the licensed businesses But we also
had questions to be in to see which we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to allow We currently allow all
marijuana businesses except retail stores
[SPEAKER_01]: under amendment 64 licensing in the city
So we allow medical all the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses and we allow every type of
recreational business except the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: storefront locations And that was on the
ballot down here in Pueblo this time,
[SPEAKER_01]: too Do we want the storefronts in Pueblo
and voters said no and that question lost
[SPEAKER_01]: by like 1,100 votes Wow, that's that's not
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's One an apartment building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two or three city blocks with the
votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not a big number It's easily
swingable the other way with hard work and
[SPEAKER_01]: focus But I mean unfortunately here in
Pueblo the entire marijuana community had
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred percent of their efforts
invested in 200 and 300 being defeated and
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly from these results we let to be in
to see Just sit ignored and because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that they lost by a very very small margin
was one of those the the new cannabis tax
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, then the city was asking if they
could have if they could allow stores and
[SPEAKER_01]: if they could tax those stores at a
special rate and both of those questions
[SPEAKER_01]: Failed as well The anti pot group theory
on this is that people just voted no on
[SPEAKER_01]: everything And if you look at the election
results a lot of the other questions that
[SPEAKER_01]: were asked people also voted no The public
safety taxes and things like that that
[SPEAKER_01]: were on the ballot here in Pueblo all got
voted down So no more money for cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more money for police.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more money for the district attorney's
office How did the cigarette tax do failed
[SPEAKER_01]: statewide?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, which is where I voted against My
own interest in that one voted for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I voted for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people who voted for it
Increasing that tax revenue would have
[SPEAKER_03]: been good for the state But so I know
you're we're trying to work on the new you
[SPEAKER_03]: want or you really want to talk about the
new?
[SPEAKER_03]: Medical states and the new recreational
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know but I keep I keep procrastinating
great great news the other local piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana election news is Denver's issue
300 yes Pueblo's issue 300 was bad
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver's issue 300 was good That this is
the question about allowing public
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption clubs In bars restaurants
taverns and then clubs that are
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically set up to be private
consumption clubs in Denver County
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the right to consume marijuana
in public with your friends in an enclosed
[SPEAKER_01]: space designed for that purpose And right
now it's winning but by a tiny tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like fifty point two percent to forty
nine point Nine or some shit like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly close It's one of those races
that really hammers home the point that
[SPEAKER_03]: every single vote Yeah, somebody would
have broken down on the way to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have gone a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep I mean there was traffic that night
that vote changes someone's uber didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: show up It's I mean it was very very close
and they're still counting those with the
[SPEAKER_01]: absentee ballots That vote won't be a
hundred percent finalized For another day
[SPEAKER_01]: or two now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and there's another race that's like
that that we're gonna get to here in a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute So let's jump on to national news
guys Did your did your issues win to this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that you voted for locally?
[SPEAKER_03]: What percentage of those would you say
came out in your favor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all okay It was the national stuff
that didn't go my way but We're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: to that here in a few minutes as well,
but most of the stuff I voted for
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody and we're not everybody in
public but the majority of voters in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo Which was nice, it's always nice to
know it's like oh, yeah, you are the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority I'm so relieved about two hundred
and three hundred man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea how to vote when it asked me
about judges Do you want this judge to
[SPEAKER_03]: retain his position?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, there's an answer
for that They no one does okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in every state there is a group of
people made up of Not judges but lawyers
[SPEAKER_01]: prosecutors district attorneys Defense
attorneys Will and probate lawyers like
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of different legal professionals
that are practicing in that state kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best of the best get put together and
then come up with a Retain or don't retain
[SPEAKER_01]: this base Wow, okay and so if you Google
your state and then like judge retention
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever You should be able to find
that group in your area and then they tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you Judge Billy Bob, you should you should
retain him because X Y&Z or you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: retain him because of X Y&Z But the way it
works in practice is nobody knows so
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody just votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes And so judge retention rates are like
93% right for a cent across the country
[SPEAKER_03]: only judge I've had interaction with and
I'm knocking on wood praising job for this
[SPEAKER_03]: one The only judge I've had interaction
with over the past few years was the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: that resided over my jury duty selection
And I don't remember his name,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if I remembered it Yeah, he was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: He that guy was polite to me He was he
treated me like the old lady and a blouse
[SPEAKER_03]: next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the judge you're talking about I'm
spacing his name, but he's a really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: human being and he's a pretty good judge
He was a cool dude But a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_01]: my world are in the live in the legal
world and so I always have an earful of
[SPEAKER_01]: judge this or this judge is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This judge isn't Yeah, how about you man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the election go your way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for the most part for what for the
for you basically just told me that all
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff I was mostly worried about the
tax the cannabis tax sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not cool I don't think that we
should be adding extra taxes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already expensive enough I think
taxing it just encourages more of the
[SPEAKER_03]: black market sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of figured it was gonna fail for
that reason Yeah, that's a silly thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: considering the the tax rate that our
retail stores pay already I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's deep enough and obviously I'm not
excited about the president that
[SPEAKER_03]: represents us now But other than that,
I guess I can live with everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: that happened the the national election
could have some serious implications for
[SPEAKER_01]: From marijuana nationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to trade our shitty cannabis
taxes and our lack of recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries in Pueblo city limits to
allow the other states to have a jump on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis I'll go for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're covered here in Pueblo Like I feel
bad for the city of Pueblo is who I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: bad for I'm self-sufficient cannabis so a
lot of that just kind of A lot of us here
[SPEAKER_01]: are but I mean, honestly, the city's had
three years And also they limited our
[SPEAKER_03]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes in the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were allowed to grow We had a hundred
square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still the rule in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the county that's limited to 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay The county just did that as a
county commissioner rule that wasn't a
[SPEAKER_03]: vote you guys I know that sounds strange
But the city of Pueblo is like a different
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the county.
[SPEAKER_03]: The county is the outer area.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not like that's it gets a little
more Yep, that's a hard word to fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: say when you're high enough cut this many
dads in the evening rural gets tough It's
[SPEAKER_03]: a little dustier and a little more wolves
and shit that direction The row ads are
[SPEAKER_03]: shitty out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are row ads Dark and it's all falling
apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's the county is a different
area So they have a little bit different
[SPEAKER_03]: rules and they actually we did vote on
uniting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an option Oh, no, it was no that
that was question 1c in question 1c here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Pueblo County asked if the county
commissioners had voter approval to take
[SPEAKER_01]: our current plant cap of 18 per
residential property if they could have
[SPEAKER_01]: our support going to the state legislature
in arguing to make that rule statewide and
[SPEAKER_01]: the only reason they put that on the
ballot is Because when county
[SPEAKER_01]: commissioners go to the state legislature
and say please make this rule if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to say we put it on the ballot and a
majority Of our constituents supported us
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing this question to you and asking
you to do this The legislature listens a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more closely And that's all
question 1c did was give the county
[SPEAKER_01]: commissioners permission to say and the
voters support us asking this of you Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lot of people freaked out about that
one and honestly in all the hoopla last
[SPEAKER_01]: night Today when somebody asked me about
question 1c I space I couldn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: remember what number It was I was
impressed that you have known as many
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers as quickly as you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been breaking down data all day
Looking because there was a big screw up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got data eyes You've got that like
computer screen face when you showed up
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a screw up in Pueblo County our
our ballot was really really long this
[SPEAKER_01]: year It was four pages and so when they
started running through these ballots
[SPEAKER_01]: through the servers for the the election
department the servers got overwhelmed
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was like just each chunk of
information for each ballot was a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit larger than usual because the ballot
was twice as long and they they're
[SPEAKER_01]: reporting that they filled up a server and
that the state election commission had to
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a server in a van and floor it down
here yesterday afternoon Install the
[SPEAKER_01]: server run test software on it half the
evening and fired it back up our local
[SPEAKER_01]: election Department people went home at 3
a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: With instructions to report Back at 9 Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were crunching as much data as
we could last night and I've been looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at it all day and I still hadn't looked at
1c with everything else that happened last
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was such a bizarre election.
[SPEAKER_01]: The data is really really weird We're
seeing demographic changes in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: that we haven't seen in our lifetime The
population is growing here rapidly People
[SPEAKER_01]: that are from here are moving they're
There are huge numbers of people from
[SPEAKER_01]: around the country that are moving here
for a variety of reasons and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: changing the demographics all over the
state in ways nobody predicted And then
[SPEAKER_01]: nationally no one expected marijuana to do
this good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was hopeful But nationally
marijuana just crushed it So I want to ask
[SPEAKER_03]: one more local just a quick one and then
we'll get off the local stuff you guys I
[SPEAKER_03]: know we probably bore the shit out of you
guys with just local but then we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about New States and they do shout
out hashtag.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like it when they like it when you
ramble We're gonna talk about new states
[SPEAKER_03]: in just one second.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the Colorado Option yet Mike signal
is gonna kill me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take a dab before we get to the
national stuff now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go On the the ballot was a
question about basically assisted suicide
[SPEAKER_03]: what the law basically said was if a
person is deemed Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna burp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just get it out of the way Okay,
I'm better now way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it smells like dank-ass pizza Too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize if that hits you Mike because
it was ripe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the on the ballot there was I'm
calling it the assisted suicide Totally
[SPEAKER_01]: fair description of the terminally if
you're terminally assisted suicide Yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're terminally ill and you're gonna
die within six months And I think it takes
[SPEAKER_03]: two doctors to verify this and you can't
be mentally ill You have to be like some
[SPEAKER_03]: sound mind to say that this is what you
want We're only the third or fourth,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the fifth state to do anything Like
this and so the law is very very careful
[SPEAKER_01]: and meticulous about the process for this
And there was a lot of anti I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember the number the the ballot issue
for this one But the opposition campaign
[SPEAKER_01]: their main argument was if your shitty
children will euthanize you to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: inheritance quicker Was the argument and
when people were like but the doctors part
[SPEAKER_01]: they were like, well, they'll just pay the
doctor more no, I Know not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is silly side note.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't get a doctor to write an extended
plan in Colorado They're not gonna risk
[SPEAKER_03]: their license for a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely not gonna risk their
license to fucking kill you that is not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna happen It was just a silly argument
and I know everybody's beliefs on this are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna vary but I mean because you brought
it up I don't mind telling the listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: that I 100% support.
[SPEAKER_03]: I filled in that bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, really strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in let's do that I watched a family
member shout out to my grandma my grandma
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a stroke my grandma was a very
dignified woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is bad as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: She raised six kids She worked until
pretty much the day she fell down and had
[SPEAKER_03]: a stroke.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had a solid job She took care of the
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: She took good care of her husband.
[SPEAKER_03]: She took good care of the grandkids.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me One day she had a stroke.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was paralyzed on her left side.
[SPEAKER_03]: She hated that She wanted to get up and do
laundry and fucking cook for us and do
[SPEAKER_03]: what grandma did.
[SPEAKER_03]: She couldn't do it anymore I swear that
when I'd go visit her in the nursing home,
[SPEAKER_03]: she'd look me straight in the eye and then
look at the plugged Her machines like
[SPEAKER_03]: you're the only one that would have the
balls to do it We reach over there and
[SPEAKER_03]: unplug that for me Jeff is that's which my
grandma was saying to me She was she did
[SPEAKER_03]: not want to live and she couldn't speak
she couldn't speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many instances in this country
where For one reason or another we
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly prolonged suffering for her
for absolutely No It's almost like of
[SPEAKER_03]: course I wanted my grandma still but I did
not want to have to have grandma miserable
[SPEAKER_03]: Like right if if I would if she could
speak if I would have fucking held
[SPEAKER_03]: something up said grandma unplug her plug
shoot a fucking Smack that unplug with
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: She could generate with whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's I have a member with Parkinson's
and part of them coming To terms and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of figuring out how to live after that
diagnosis Was setting up basically with a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of people in their life that if the
time comes that I want to go like will you
[SPEAKER_01]: help me acquire whatever I have to acquire
to get that done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this law didn't exist that right
because their only option was to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to wither away While they were a hundred
percent aware of their body collapsing
[SPEAKER_01]: around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was it's an incredibly brutal
diagnosis and This issue was close to me
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was glad I was thrilled that it
passed with it I crushed it last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It passed with two-thirds of the vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it didn't just win it won A
landslide that's that's one that I
[SPEAKER_03]: strongly support it because I'm gonna get
old one day and I don't need anybody I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to be a burden on anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't I'm a young scrapping young lad,
you know I'm saying I'm able-bodied if
[SPEAKER_03]: some shit needs to be and I could probably
do it and I don't want to be I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a burden on somebody like
instructions if if I'm a vegetable or a
[SPEAKER_01]: burden Harvest what you can for other
people and cremate the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, sprinkle it over a pot field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, preferably with some sun The Sun is
sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I'm glad that one passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you supported that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah That wasn't too weird for anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't mean to get into the right
to die on this podcast But that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how we stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I supported when I saw it
I was like that's an option you were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's I that's something that needs
to be Yeah, you got the right to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the right to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where this I'm an American
I can pull whatever I want my body that
[SPEAKER_01]: includes a cigarette and that includes
Mountain Dew and that includes
[SPEAKER_01]: cheeseburgers that I'm talking includes a
bullet Yeah, yeah free freedom Alright,
[SPEAKER_03]: so let's get to what we've been kind of
hinting at we didn't even mention the
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking elephant in the room We got
fucking the fucking Oompa Loompa is our
[SPEAKER_03]: president now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So grab her right by the pussy everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I got to say We've got some new
states that are on the 17 economy team
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis in 2017 we've got coming
out of the gate with fresh cannabis The
[SPEAKER_01]: the first big news last night was Florida
Florida's now medical marijuana state
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the club, Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not an easy
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice to see a lot of the stuff
we're talking about tonight was East
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, even Bible Belt Rhode Island passed
a marijuana initiative, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had one I mean main is who I'm thinking
of main is the maybe Okay, right now
[SPEAKER_01]: mains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a recreational leader legalization
state Right now that question is winning
[SPEAKER_01]: by a tiny tiny percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still counting shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep This is back to every single vote
counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're counting absentee ballots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're counting the military ballots
accounting the fishermen ballots And in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of places for no reason whatsoever
people waited till yesterday to vote When
[SPEAKER_01]: they had significant other options And so
I mean people were still voting at 8 o
[SPEAKER_01]: 'clock last night and then it's at 8 o
'clock or 7 o'clock or whatever the polls
[SPEAKER_03]: close They start counting the ballots then
And they don't start like They don't get a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking for the most on it for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even get a jump on it And
that's part of the reason the pot industry
[SPEAKER_03]: are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the reason why the this
stuff is so slow And that's part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reason why you don't see early vote totals
for votes cast anywhere Like I voted like
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I voted like two days after my
ballot arrived I mailed it in the night of
[SPEAKER_01]: the third debate My wife had some wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We watched the debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still got a half an hour to process
What the fuck we just watched and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: went through our ballot and it was a long
ballot So it took like two hours and there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a lot of freaking out while we did it
But they make it real easy in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there was this like two and a half
three week period where you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they fucking Got votes and they just won't
tell you what they say yet It's real
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrating when you're doing election
work because it's information that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could use I was gonna say they don't want
to sway anything That's part of the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't do it is because if I say
Jeff's winning over Mike by ten votes all
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sudden Mike supporters have a
Rallying cry to get more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, should I better get out there and
vote?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, and that's I think that's part of
what we saw nationally last night How many
[SPEAKER_01]: people saw things saying Hillary was 85%
to win?
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three days ago A national media.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when when is the next we got four years
to the next election?
[SPEAKER_03]: When when can I start getting people to
register to vote again?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I just totally try to write your
idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they know immediately they can do
that now for the next for the 2020
[SPEAKER_03]: election Michael Franti runs for
president.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, the front you warn or Warren
Franti Pretty proud of you for that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Franti from spearhead and uncle
Warren Haynes from government meal
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to our medical marijuana states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that wreck or medical medical?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing all medical right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: North Dakota is now a medical marijuana
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the club, Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who saw that coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm 99% sure Florida, North Dakota and
Arkansas all voted Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got I'm 99% sure that Florida,
North Dakota and Arkansas almost always
[SPEAKER_01]: lean conservative and they still went
medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is spreading in ways that are
were unheard of five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, states that were guaranteed to never
liberalize their marijuana laws are now
[SPEAKER_01]: doing so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in numbers that are shocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three new medical states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually think that I might have two
missing on my list.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have some rec states?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, they're all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I may be missing one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You told me four and I think there were
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Nevada, Nevada failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Nevada passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I'm missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: There she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now for rec states, recreational
marijuana, any adult over 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali amendment 64 crushed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you I don't even know if I want to get
into the amendment 64 debate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got friends on both sides of that
battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They live in California that are on both
sides of the industry, the big business
[SPEAKER_03]: side, the small business side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two months saw the existing
industry pairing up with national anti
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana forces to fight amendment 64 or
proposition 64 in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical marijuana existing industry
and the marijuana advocate community
[SPEAKER_01]: paired up with Project Sam, Lucky Kevin's
event and Patrick Kennedy's nightmare of
[SPEAKER_01]: an anti marijuana group to fight
legalization in California, largely for
[SPEAKER_01]: economic reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: If marijuana is legal in real companies
can invest real money and open real
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses and it's really regulated and
it's really lab tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't grow weed in my basement,
make a living anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that we in my basement and take it
to a store shelf and make money that way
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know guys that happened to and I know a
lot of people that happened to in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Made us have to become master growers at
facilities and have other ways of income.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I'm sorry, but that's the point
of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not legalizing marijuana because we
can't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not legalizing marijuana because
it's hard to find or because it was too
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to call my fucking dealer on my
way to work and make sure he was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be around after work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it because we're sick of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want lab tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be able to swing by this store
on our way home just like we do for the
[SPEAKER_01]: milk and cookies and the eggs and the
chicken, the whiskey and the beer and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have to call a friend when
I want to buy sneakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to wait two days because he's
not answering my texts right now because
[SPEAKER_01]: he's with some hot new chick so I can buy
a jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why people are still willing
to do this for the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a common thing with dope guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Reddit marijuana forums and stuff,
you see people bitching about dealer
[SPEAKER_01]: etiquette, customer etiquette constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have too if I didn't keep up with
parts of the online community that are
[SPEAKER_01]: still in illegal states that still have to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember when you were always
wondering if the person you were meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: up with was going to have either the money
or the product they told you they were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have or if they were going to
have two homies and a knife or a gun?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just never knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go buy jeans, you don't wonder if
you're going to get robbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go buy a Big Mac, you don't have
to arrange it first and then wait outside
[SPEAKER_01]: and then hang out for two hours so you
don't look like foot traffic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have exact change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to carry drumsticks in and
out with you every time pretending like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking fucking drum lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just go to the store, buy your
marijuana, know that it's not filled with
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides or spider mite eggs,
go home and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're doing it and it comes
with a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a weirdo looking dude and
you're carrying around portions of things
[SPEAKER_03]: that you need concealed, a guitar case is
my favorite way to do that type of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out in the open, you just fucking got a
big old guitar case filled with whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Desperado style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine's usually a little more peaceful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to put shit in there, a lot of good
shit in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drumsticks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but if you've got a lot of
drumsticks that you need to vacuum seal
[SPEAKER_03]: and wrap real tight, you can fit a lot of
them in a guitar case and it just looks
[SPEAKER_03]: normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just walk around with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, you're fucking hippie
with a guitar case.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless someone wants to steal your guitar
or a chick wants you to play a song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the list of new rec states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tangent is brought to you by Blue OG
from Botanico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live resin makes my head spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: California is now recreational marijuana
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts, bringing up our first East
Coast recreational state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all my assholes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass was a really, really contested race.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of outside money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of outside anti-marijuana
groups throwing their two cents and their
[SPEAKER_01]: reef for madness at the issue there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent a little bit of time in
Massachusetts, one of my best friends on
[SPEAKER_03]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to high school and after high
school, I went on fish tour and then did
[SPEAKER_03]: some panic shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% of that time, sitting next to me in
the passenger seat or the driver's seat
[SPEAKER_03]: occasionally was my buddy Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a masshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: One summer, we did a bunch of widespread
panic shows from New Mexico all the way to
[SPEAKER_03]: Boston.
[SPEAKER_03]: We missed a couple of shows because the
car broke, but we had a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He moved to Quincy Mass, I think,
was where he moved to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Boston and we went all over
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a conservative place.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, I didn't have dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had long, filthy hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wearing a fish t-shirt and patchwork
pants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably either had skate shoes or no
shoes because that's how I used to roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts gave me the... It's one big
Cherry Creek.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cherry Creek is like the company
version of Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all of it, but a good chunk of it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very conservative area.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the places my buddy Rob took me to
felt very... Everything was overpriced and
[SPEAKER_03]: the cars were a little nicer than I should
be driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt out of place at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, shout out to Rob the Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, I'm glad that you can get yourself
some legal cannabis here next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out for Mass joining the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to bike also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they've got legal casinos,
legal prostitution and legal weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada's law...
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wrecked now, but their medical law
really pushed the envelope as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: what's allowed, what's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Reciprocity, they were one of the few
places where you could take your med card
[SPEAKER_01]: from any other medical state, walk into a
Nevada medical marijuana shop and purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do that in California with my
Colorado card.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that in Colorado with a
California card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reciprocity is rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nevada was the first one to step up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was not surprised to see them go
legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the anti-marijuana money spent in
this campaign came from casinos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily those in Nevada,
but that's one of those anti-marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: funding points that's common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to start changing in
Nevada now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't they want me to get super
blazed and gamble?
[SPEAKER_01]: Common wisdom is because you'd spend more
if you were drinking, is my guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't go because I can't get blazed and
gamble.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could just safely go up to my... Like
Vegas until now was zero tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if there was a place where I could go
either smoke a joint or take a couple dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the casino floor and then come
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's all I... I just want to go to
my hotel room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to dab on the casino floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little fucked up I'm asking for
that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time I was in the casino,
they kept bringing me a new ashtray every
[SPEAKER_01]: four minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fuck all the nonsmokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of our last little,
we're all going to get cancer and die
[SPEAKER_01]: together little strongholds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbing at the slot machine would just get
reckless for me because there's that
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of minutes right after you take a
dab where the world is spinning and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just like, oh fuck, I don't need to be
right at the machine there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to check out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of why I go off and dab
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to just check out of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like taking a lunch break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go fucking be somewhere that's not
loud and shit happening that you can just
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking shut your brain up, take a couple
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to slowly re-enter and
just... I would love to, or if I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: place where I could just go take a couple
dabs or smoke a joint and then go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the tables, I'd actually go back up to
Blackhawk and stuff again, or Vegas would
[SPEAKER_01]: hold a little more interest for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as it is now, it's like, yay,
I get to go drive all my drunk friends
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a nice change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last one on the maybe list is
Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we teased this one a little bit
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of Maine is currently in a very,
very tight race.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anti-marijuana folks in Maine have
already sworn to take this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take it to court and ask
for a recount and make sure that the votes
[SPEAKER_01]: were tallied correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's step one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how close it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it's within 3,000 votes
total.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last news report I saw said one of
the counties that had gone a majority no
[SPEAKER_01]: vote for legalization, they found like
another 2,700 ballots, like absentee
[SPEAKER_01]: ballots that might've not been counted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's little things like that
that they're squeezing through and making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure everything gets cleaned up that could
put Maine in the no column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anti-legalization people or anti-marijuana
people are already calling Maine a win
[SPEAKER_01]: because the big bad marijuana industry
didn't win in a landslide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a tight race, because they
can legally contest it and ask for a
[SPEAKER_01]: recount, they're putting that one in the
win column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, they're putting it next to
Arizona, which belongs in their win
[SPEAKER_01]: column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization got crushed in Arizona,
lost by a good chunk of the vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess is it had to do specifically with
that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just group these as medical states and
rec states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every law in all the states we listed is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do the same thing in very,
very different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the success of the vote often depends
on the nuances there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had Colorado's amendment 64 been worded
differently, might not have passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with all the votes last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's part of what we're
seeing in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also had a shitload of money thrown
at their anti-legalization campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say half a million from Discount
Tire and two million from Sheldon Adelson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I usually don't, I do endorse
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disendorse companies very often,
other than this fucking headphone amp.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've bashed this headphone amp from,
I've got one that works now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is a lot, I'm not going to curse
it, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Discount Tire can eat my ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Discount Tire is a place where you go to
get Discount Tires.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pay regular price for fucking tires
because Discount Tire isn't giving you a
[SPEAKER_03]: discount anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just put the word discount in there
to trick you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They contributed heavily to keeping
cannabis illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make tires.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they give a shit if cannabis is
illegal or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep an eye out for who supports what.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be shocked how many companies that
you spend money at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actively take your money, shake your hand,
turn around and spend the money you just
[SPEAKER_01]: put in their pocket against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here locally, we had a number of companies
that the marijuana industry was actively
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting, by choice as a group,
that as it turns out have been actively
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to dismantle us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry-wide, there's been shifts in who
we advertise with here, who we use for
[SPEAKER_01]: trash service here, who we use for
construction work here, where we fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: shop for meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people came out actively
against us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elections have consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your public support and denouncement of
things have consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is true in your area as well,
listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff affects everything you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all of these states that just
went rec and medical bringing our national
[SPEAKER_01]: total to eight full legal marijuana states
where any adult can buy marijuana if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're over 21 in a licensed and
regulated store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight legal states and 28 medical
marijuana states.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in five Americans lives in an area
where they can buy marijuana legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like three in five when you do the
medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now some of that 28 is CBD-only oil laws
in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Places like Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With numbers like that, those give me hope
for our national news because as all of
[SPEAKER_01]: you know now or have had the chance to
learn, Trump is now our president or our
[SPEAKER_01]: president-elect.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll take over in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: This election also gave control of the
Senate to the GOP and the House of
[SPEAKER_01]: Representatives to the GOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all likelihood, that group of people
will be replacing three Supreme Court
[SPEAKER_01]: justices in the next four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shape of American politics,
that landscape is all shifting drastically
[SPEAKER_01]: under our feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons President Obama wasn't
able to do a lot of the things he had
[SPEAKER_01]: campaigned on trying to do was because the
opposition party, the Republicans held the
[SPEAKER_01]: large majorities in either the House or
the Senate during his presidency.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the president wanted to do something,
the opposition party would make it as hard
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be true for President
Trump, at least for the first two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got party majority in all of
government, which means Trump wanty,
[SPEAKER_01]: Trump probably get to do-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: For marijuana legalization, before last
night, the picture was a lot darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the campaign trail, some of
President-elect Trump, sorry listeners,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a conservative, that's just
saying that does weird things in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But President-elect Trump has spent a lot
of time working very closely with some
[SPEAKER_01]: strong prohibitionist politicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Christie is a big Trump supporter,
has been on the campaign trail stumping
[SPEAKER_01]: for Trump since he dropped out of the
presidential race himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of the people that was
promising to send the army to shut us down
[SPEAKER_01]: on day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legal marijuana industry period from
the federal government can basically
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately void the coal memo and the
Ogden memo and begin doing what's
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary to enforce the Controlled
Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call Colorado up and say, hey,
either you stop all this legal marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit or we yank all your road funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado doesn't survive without federal
dollars, no state does.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they got coast to coast alcohol
laws in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been the threat all along as states
have crafted their own marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: industries in their own way, like we've
been doing for the last 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That at any point, someone in federal
government would yank that leash and the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire industry we've built would have
crumbled back into the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, with eight legal states,
28 medical states and an election last
[SPEAKER_01]: night where eight of nine succeeded,
that says a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Republicans and Democrats turn out
in big numbers last night and vote for
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both parties were talking about whoever
gets elected, job one is trying to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: the nation back together, try to heal some
of the divisiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an issue that we're now agreeing
on as a majority population, not just the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of Democrats, not just the
majority of Republicans, not just the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of young people or black people
or Hispanic people, but the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans agree on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be incredibly costly for
a future Trump administration to really go
[SPEAKER_01]: after legal marijuana at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just too much support coast to
coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, had last night's election had one
state join rec and maybe two join medical,
[SPEAKER_01]: that mandate isn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep coming back to every vote really
counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we really digest what happened on
Tuesday, that's going to be what's clear,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that if you're not participating in
this, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that disagree with you get to
make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we go from here is anyone's guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened starting in January?
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between President-elect
Trump on the campaign trail and in last
[SPEAKER_01]: night's concession speech was night and
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That speech alone changed the conversation
nationally from, oh, fuck, who's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: good bunker to maybe we all survive this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally in one speech and a lot
of the national media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think somebody grabbed him by the
collar and sat him down and was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, it's clear that for the last couple
of weeks, several important people have
[SPEAKER_01]: been in root conversations with Donald
Trump explaining that president of the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States isn't a game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real repercussions, billions of lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just gave someone who's accurately been
described as Orange Hitler, all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: nuclear launch codes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's happening in the next couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, immediately when the election
results came in last night, like 10 o
[SPEAKER_01]: 'clock, 11 o'clock at night when we knew,
okay, Hillary lost, Donald Trump won.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's calling him to concede the race.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: International stock markets all over the
world started crashing.
[SPEAKER_01]: An hour and a half later, he made his
concession speech and the crash stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world is watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we forget is that
planet earth is a big idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very small place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're 20 hours apart from every
human on earth at most.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means in 20 hours, the person that's
furthest away on this planet from wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: you are right now can be shaking your hand
where you're standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very small place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a leader in every way globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we give the keys to a reality TV show
contestant or host or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: the world takes notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clear that someone's been in his ear
for weeks emphasizing this because his
[SPEAKER_01]: entire demeanor was different last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even his supporters were running him to
run it on stage and kick the podium down
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, America, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab bricks, people, and some mortar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what people were expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it didn't happen and he came off as
presidential, the entire world noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire world noticed nine states
voting on marijuana last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other nations are looking at legalizing
marijuana from the government down because
[SPEAKER_01]: they see what's happening in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see the headache of voter put forth
ballot efforts and how hard it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate and tax a voter initiative law
rather than craft a legalization law from
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground up that works well in the
system they've already got in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Places like Uruguay, they're not waiting
for the voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other countries that were
watching Florida last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were watching California last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're watching Maine now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In thinking, we signed the same
conventions the United States did that
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibit us from legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: These laws have been just as destructive
here as they are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our people here deserve the same
opportunity to be free of the problems
[SPEAKER_01]: these laws cause that the people in
Colorado do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing it themselves because
elections matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elections have consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do this smartly from the top
down, it can go a little smoother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason this process is so ugly
and so messy and so fucking slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for cussing so much tonight,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuss it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so proud of myself that I haven't
thrown anything in the last 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that's because I'm always holding
a rig, but still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really, really stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, with what we're left looking at
right now, where we go from here is
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone's guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of where we go from here is totally
up to Donald Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we honestly, the guy just gave
that man the driver's seat of the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where he takes us is really anyone's
guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's pretty clear, if you've been
paying attention to reality, a lot of his
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign promises are not at all realistic
or feasible.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bigly crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like him promising that if we
elected him, aliens would finally
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's still going to be president for
four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still going to appoint a cabinet.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still going to replace Supreme Court
justices.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to govern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he decide to yank our federal funding
until all 50 states fall back in line with
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he finally crack the whip and say
it's time to legalize nationally or at
[SPEAKER_01]: least let the states do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally every decision is a
fucking coin flip at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope that somebody's screaming,
look how popular it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did better than almost every candidate
on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't come out strongly against
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: He could be sitting down with Chris
Christie right now, having a scotch and a
[SPEAKER_01]: rose act, talking about how they're going
to round up all the hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the really scary things that
happened last night was private prison
[SPEAKER_01]: stocks skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff's eyebrow just went through the top
of his hat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been joking for days now that I hope
me and all my friends end up in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: FEMA camps.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: FEMA camps are very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the more fun rumors about
Obama's presidency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the type of people that those people
are that they do not like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's 100% possible that a new
administration goes a very different
[SPEAKER_01]: direction than the Obama administration
has gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason legalization advocates
have pushed the Obama administration as
[SPEAKER_01]: hard as they have for more on
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every chance we've gotten, we've begged
for movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've gotten a little bit,
very, very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we've only gotten a little bit
of movement federally, the next
[SPEAKER_01]: administration can do whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can put an end to all of this with a
couple of meetings, a strategy and like 35
[SPEAKER_01]: phone calls or a press release is really
all it would take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be a lot of kicking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be a lot of screaming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be a lot of hell, no, we won't go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, you're talking about
stoners versus drones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to change the laws is to
participate in the system and vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully the people that are about to
take power caught the mandate from last
[SPEAKER_01]: night and we're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only group of people that are really
happy right now, that I see in my social
[SPEAKER_01]: media feeds are the marijuana people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardcore marijuana people know that
marijuana had a huge night last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liberals are disappointed and confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conservatives are really confused and kind
of shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoners are happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I honestly think that it's a little
early to be super happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you in states that just
passed either medical or rec, get involved
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on your computer when you hear this
and figure out what area you live in,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's governed by a city council or
county commission or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out when those meetings are and
start going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out when your state legislature
meets and what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can attend those meetings,
because if you're a state, like if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in California right now, those rules are
just being written.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those cities that have been passing
marijuana bans leading bans leading up
[SPEAKER_01]: into the election were doing so that they
had time to write rules for 64 so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they could pick the zoning and pick the
buffer distances and pick the tax numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be participating in those
hearings if you want any kind of say in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, the people who do care are
going to get what they want in those laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go put your face in that mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go be seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humans, no matter what your job is,
if you're a councilman, if you're a zoning
[SPEAKER_03]: commissioner, if you make the laws,
if you're the judge, if you go to whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting it is, at the end of the meeting,
there's always that 15 minutes where
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody just stands around and
bullshits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you're the guy like Mike that
goes to every single city council meeting
[SPEAKER_03]: that he can, maybe one of the guys that
are running that is on the fence about how
[SPEAKER_03]: they feel about you, maybe they'll
actually walk up and actually speak to you
[SPEAKER_03]: because they just want someone to talk to
for that next 10 minutes till they have to
[SPEAKER_03]: go to the next meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to blend in like everyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to seem like a dick and
it's socially acceptable to just walk up
[SPEAKER_03]: and talk to the other guy at that council
meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may end up putting the right bug in
his ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: He may talk to you and realize,
man, that guy is six, five with dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_03]: and his eyes are red and he wears a red,
golden green t-shirt every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I spoke to him, he was
intelligent.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sounded like he knew what he was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm not so afraid of these cannabis
guys because that guy is compassionate and
[SPEAKER_03]: that guy is telling me about his friend
with cancer that he's helping take care of
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might spark something in somebody and
you may accidentally put them on your
[SPEAKER_03]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at a couple of different watch
parties on election night.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I stopped by the Democratic watch
party, one of my local representatives in
[SPEAKER_01]: the city was asking me if I thought eight
stores would be enough to dedicate a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: stream of revenue to law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quickly turned the conversation into
production facilities that we already
[SPEAKER_01]: allow or where you want that money to come
from because it's a more stable revenue
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a quick two-minute
conversation, but it was somebody in city
[SPEAKER_01]: government who knew me from these
meetings, they were bored at a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came wandering over to me to chat for
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when they're looking at the budget
next week and they see that our two ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about more money for law
enforcement failed, they've got an option
[SPEAKER_01]: that they might be able to fill some of
that hole with now that might not have
[SPEAKER_01]: been on the table before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that's down the road for the
states that just voted on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in California or Massachusetts
or Nevada, right now your city or your
[SPEAKER_01]: county is talking about or is about to be
talking about zoning rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of land and what type of areas
in our community do we want to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: production facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to allow grows or extraction
labs or stores?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many feet from school should they be?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of labeling should we require?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of testing should we require?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are about to make those
decisions don't have a fucking clue about
[SPEAKER_01]: any of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know cannabis is a weed, they know
that it needs water and sunlight to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I guess you can grow it under
lights and that it's probably bad for your
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't show up to these meetings and
bring reality to them, they're never going
[SPEAKER_01]: to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to pass rules to regulate
what's in their head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get stuck with some of the
rules that we get and you're left
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining them to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a crazy rule that we follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we have to bleach our trash?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is bleach good for the environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me talk about that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran a big grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had over a hundred lights and people
would climb a barbed wire fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a statewide rule because the
legislature kind of saw this coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would put carpets, old school style
like we used to do back in the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: throw a carpet over the barbed wire fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Graffiti style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw the carpet over the fence,
jump the fence, and then climb up a big
[SPEAKER_03]: pole above the trash can and jump off this
pole.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had plastic trash can lids,
the giant dumpster.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were that thick light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That real hard, heavy plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would smash their bodies through it
and then they'd get in there and steal our
[SPEAKER_03]: trash bags, which was why would we throw
away weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sticks and stems and mainly office
trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an office.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a bathroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was bathroom trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Thai food trash because I ate
lunch there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people breaking into marijuana
business dumpsters don't know about the
[SPEAKER_01]: rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, we had to put a stainless
steel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, these lids were so heavy that I had
to get on a chair to lift them up because
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't get enough leverage from the
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were so heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found a way to cut the poles,
the hinges off of the ends now to get into
[SPEAKER_03]: that trash can.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on camera doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been pulled over and busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same guy that does it repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you guys, I'm off on a crazy plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of weird rules here mainly
because when it came time to pass these
[SPEAKER_01]: rules, to write a lot of them,
the marijuana community was busy
[SPEAKER_01]: scrambling trying to start a business
before the rules got in place so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: could open it their way at their location
and hopefully get grandfathered in later
[SPEAKER_01]: when rules finally did get passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grandfather shit didn't work out too
well for a lot of us, did it?
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point, we had over a thousand
marijuana retail locations in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the week before real regulations
came down the pipe for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time that first regulation set
hit, the feds came in and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, any of you that aren't a
thousand feet from a school and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to make that thousand feet as long
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's the Grand Canyon between me and
you, it doesn't matter if we're only 995
[SPEAKER_01]: feet apart at the opposite sides of the
Grand Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as the crow flies is what they called
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be by the foot and then they
recently changed it and that fucked a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they changed that rule, a third of
our shops had to move or close down and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the shops that were near 980 feet from
whatever school, the feds said you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: close.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only big closure of shops we
had in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds closed down about 50 of them for
being too close to schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the rules being put in place closed
almost 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, another 150 have dropped out
of the running because it's just too much
[SPEAKER_01]: of a headache.
[SPEAKER_03]: What really bothered me about a lot of the
rulemaking was it created a scenario where
[SPEAKER_03]: guys like ... Okay, I can use Scott Reach
as an example because he's gone full
[SPEAKER_03]: circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, Scott Reach from Rare
Dankness opened up a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was called White Mountain
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dispensary was the fucking example.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what dispensaries should have been
back then, but that was the Wild Wild West
[SPEAKER_03]: when there weren't any rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were what's called vertically
integrated before vertical integration was
[SPEAKER_03]: a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were growing everything they were
selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were producing it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were packaging it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was happening in house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all like a one man show basically
with Scott and a couple of homies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they started implementing all these
new systems, all these new rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: all these new laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys that were putting their heart
into the grow, these guys were sleeping in
[SPEAKER_03]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had cots between the rows of plants
where these guys would take a nap when the
[SPEAKER_03]: lights went off for the 12-12 cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd sleep in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd wake up and sneak out and go in the
other room and work on that after they had
[SPEAKER_03]: a nap.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were killing it, but all the new
rules forced cameras and so much other
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit that they couldn't afford.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys with heart that would love these
plants got forced out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys that own car dealerships and own
whatever other random business that went
[SPEAKER_03]: to business school and just saw an
opportunity in Colorado, they came in and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're like, well, I got money and they
bought shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, unfortunately, a lot of those types
of folks are who are running the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and the heart got pissed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a weird lack of quality in
large portions of the legal market here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me wrap up because I started with
Scott Reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to give Scott a shout out and finish
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Scott owns the most high-tech,
most sophisticated, most impressive
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking grow facility in the state of
Colorado that I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is now producing, once again,
some of the best quality cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_03]: very large scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's available for retail purchase.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does the wholesale thing, so it ends up
in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's back at it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went full circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to see a lot more of the
people who were doing it from their heart
[SPEAKER_01]: finally getting up and running again,
but for a year and a half, two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: three years, all of them have been looking
for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people running the big production
facilities are the people that have money
[SPEAKER_01]: and not the people that have talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's led to a lot of like, wow,
solid C+.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had somebody excitedly show me some bud
that was 2.2% THC, 7.7% CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excitedly like, this is on our shelf now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of looked at him and he kind of
looked at me and then he was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: but why aren't you excited?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been asking for CBD flower for a
while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, that ain't it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got more CBD stuck to my oil slick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I hate to brush your bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get up above 10, get closer to 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got passion and talent and skill
producing marijuana, you know what quality
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a passion for helping share
your love of marijuana with other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really time to bite the bullet and
start spending Mondays at city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take you two years of really
boring meetings that don't have anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with marijuana and long public
testimony sessions where one person gets
[SPEAKER_01]: up and said, marijuana is the devil's
lettuce and it's going to make everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody gets up and say,
no, we're going to pave the streets with
[SPEAKER_01]: gold and everybody's going to get two cute
redheads to go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just argue back and forth all
night long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't go and there isn't
someone there to make rational arguments
[SPEAKER_01]: to the people that finally make these
decisions in your area, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: wake up one morning and it's going to be a
two and a half hour drive to the pot
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have done that to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get to that pot store that's two
and a half hours away, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: mediocre quality and twice as expensive as
your old dealer back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be your fault for
skipping out on these meetings and for
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping that somebody else goes down and
fights for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my takeaway from this election
is you got to participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you did not vote in this election,
you cannot bitch about anything for the
[SPEAKER_03]: next four years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that I want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, we've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got any final words, do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm giving you the chance for,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: With most political issues, we're talking
about changing what is a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to raise the age or whatever
from this to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little tiny insignificant
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give people five more years
if they commit whatever crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of what we're changing is already
laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to stuff like marijuana
legalization, we're changing to a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: new system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're crafting stuff for people to
vote on, how you write the issue matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's passed in the law in your state
and it passes by popular vote,
[SPEAKER_01]: that feels like the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that's getting invited to the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels like a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't get me wrong, voting on
legalization as a state is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that feeling in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking about it a lot last night,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very much the beginning of the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have not won yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, Oregon, I'm seeing that a huge
number of towns, cities and counties
[SPEAKER_01]: banned rec sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those are doing it to wait and
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are doing it because they
fucking hate marijuana and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand why their state legalized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are doing it because they
want a little more time to finish crafting
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of them are doing it because not
enough pro marijuana people are showing up
[SPEAKER_01]: to meetings and voicing their support for
allowing the legal marijuana industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: their area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon's a big legalization state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been on the list for a minute now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't have nearly the access we
do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that's because they don't have
the community that we have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the activists that we have
here that are fighting for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for places like Massachusetts,
Nevada, Maine, Florida, North Dakota,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arkansas, you guys need to start hitting
those meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to figure out how these rules get
made in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of you should be at work and
don't have time to dedicate to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of how I became me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the guy that didn't have work on
Monday nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the guy who already had a background
in law and politics and was willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: bite the bullet and go to a couple of
these meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get wherever you are, to where we are
now in Colorado, it's going to take people
[SPEAKER_01]: like me willing to step up and go to the
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy for you guys to hit me up on
social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask me for tips and tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're having trouble finding something
out, I'm happy for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to help you research it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, you've got to get
out there and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can they reach you?
[SPEAKER_01]: The easiest way, honestly, is through
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send a message to Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws, that will get to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will get to my pocket with a nice
notification.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tweet me at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly my Twitter was to annoy
prohibitionists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have officially been blocked by all of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly I just use that for sharing news
stories with the little Twitterverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get me on either of those and I'm
happy to answer all your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that last dab just kicked in
because I looked down at your phone and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, yeah, we should listen to some
music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just getting a song lined up for the
end of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had nothing to do with any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, folks, I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been our election episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we hit what you were hoping for us
to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we didn't, that's what emailing Jeff is
all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to email me, if you want more
details, I think we went for an hour and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half here, so I hope we covered everything
you wanted to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big election, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for the rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Mike, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the content.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that when you come and be on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys send me an email if you want to,
if you want to hear more about this
[SPEAKER_03]: election.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to hear anything about
cannabis, we talked about this a minute
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, the future is, let's see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to paint a bleak picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready for whatever comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been bored anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like change and excitement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to experience the future with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happens, it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, you got to go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be cool now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Stitcher sucks because it's hard to
leave reviews on Stitcher, but iTunes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can search for the Grow From Your
Heart podcast and then you can,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I'll turn your mic down so you can
take a dab and cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to scroll all the way to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on the little icon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the reviews and ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rating and reviews.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far I've got like 36 positive reviews
was the last time I looked, but go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me some stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the option to give me one
through five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me five stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a five star general.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would appreciate it if you click on five
stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not begging for five.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels shitty to ask you for five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me what you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I'm giving you, you know,
go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic's back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five stars, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you earned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's choking and trying to hype up the
show at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So throw us some stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the best part is type in the comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think about the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you love the show, type it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hate the show, type it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think I should go fuck myself,
tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read it on the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't troll me too hard,
but I look forward to what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Type in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a whole lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm almost at 10,000 followers on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like it if you help me get to
10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: My Instagram account is irey underscore
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also don't forget to check out my friends
at the dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge, huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've heard enough, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But huge, gigantic thumbs up, cheesy face,
smiled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who voted, thanks for participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people voted for a lot of
different issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It matters that everybody got out and
voted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be ready for the next election.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know places around the US that are
voting again in like four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't want to start seeing political
ads again in two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's small local stuff like county,
city election stuff, but there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: something going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If nothing else in your area, you will
have a midterm election in two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure your friends and family are
registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're talking about the stuff
that's going to be on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drove an hour and a half each way for
two ballots to make sure that two people
[SPEAKER_01]: got their ballots, got a chance to fill
them out, and then I drove them to a
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropbox for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to make sure that they had a chance
to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there because they were voting
one way or another on any issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make sure they got the chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important that everybody gets that
chance, and you should exercise that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exercise your rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to only exercise your right
to remain silent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got other rights too, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap up
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to piss like you would not believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over here wiggling around in my chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually brag about my podcast bladder.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have found my limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hammered this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for sticking with us, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, make sure you follow Mike on
social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you follow me on the social
media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence,
and until next time, take a fat dab and
[SPEAKER_03]: give your mom a hug for me.
It's the end
[SPEAKER_05]: of the world as we know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the end of the world as we know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the end of the world as we know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel fine.
