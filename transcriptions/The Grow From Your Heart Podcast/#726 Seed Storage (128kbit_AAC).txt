[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's jump right into this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about storing our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few previous episodes, I've taught
you how to make silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught you when to pollinate,
how to pollinate, how to pollinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to apply the pollen, how to store the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten all the way up to making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have harvested seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about what do we do with
those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first answer is going to be grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a seed breeder, my favorite thing to do
with new seeds is to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a seed breeder who made new seeds and
sent them out to my friends, I want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst thing for a seed breeder to see
is seeds in a box, in a vault,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a drawer, not getting grown,
not getting any attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those in the dirt on the websites,
on the packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that it may be illegal to
germinate them in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a souvenir, but deep down
inside, we really wish that you would grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit out of those and send us a bunch
of pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you've made seeds, the next thing
to do is to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, sometimes you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make more seeds than I could possibly
grow in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an army of testers, a gang of
friends out there just growing seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best thing to do is to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you can't grow all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to store some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about storing our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's back up to the point of just before
getting the seeds into packages,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk a little bit about harvesting
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we can even think about storing
these seeds in any way, they need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said the words dry, so the dry,
dry, dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said those words so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: While talking about storing pollen,
while talking about harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: while talking about storing seeds,
dryness is very important when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want our weeds super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want our buds dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we do a slow dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for seeds, for pollen, we need that
stuff super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is your worst nightmare for seeds
and pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind throughout this
entire process, that moisture is your
[SPEAKER_00]: worst nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, seeds don't like drastic temperature
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about that more, but let's
talk about getting the seeds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case you missed the harvest
episode, let's get the seeds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the buds super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have this idea that seeds
need to be wintered or frozen or cold over
[SPEAKER_00]: a season or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about in a previous episode that
I've seen seeds germinate inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which tells me they don't need any
time to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're ready, once they're ripe,
they are viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're powerful seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisture can cause that to happen
inside of the wet buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to store wet seeds or wet buds
or wet pollen into a container and seal it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and just ignore it, it will definitely
create a moldy environment which will ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get this product super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get the seeds dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get the product bone dry before
I start packaging it up in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits out wide open until I'm confident
in the dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say dry a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to talk about desiccant
packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at some on my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bag of them over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not confuse the desiccant packs with a
Boveda pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to suck out moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boveda pack, the other Humida packs,
those add moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to remove it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get confused on the packets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the appropriate packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desiccant pack, dryness pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a moisture packet once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the buds super dry the way I like
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buds are completely dry and I'll put
them in a bin, maybe a five gallon bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a stir light bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put on gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll crumble it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll use another method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove the seeds from that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're going to start talking
about storing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got a lot of seeds, I will use a
small mason jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got just a number of seeds that I
know won't last very long, I put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: three by three jewelry baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from Hobby Lobby or Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: A three by three square bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy seeds from me in the regular
packages, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those baggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how many I have,
I either use a glass jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll use a smaller glass vial or
oftentimes that three by three baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the seeds dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put them in the container,
which you wish to store them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually they need to go into something
that is lightproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said I put them in those baggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also go into another container for
storage, which is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your container, you may want to choose
something that is opaque or what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: word that is dark that will keep the light
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something colored or tinted or
eventually it should go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to store our seeds in a package
that we can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to make airtight and keep the light
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to put that in somewhere that
is cool, dry and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to get light on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want extreme cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put your seeds in a container,
whether a jar, a baggie, a vial,
[SPEAKER_00]: then a huge piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label them very excessively clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that I'm going to package up
some Arise F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would label at the top would say Arise
F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would say Golden Goat to
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would have the date that those
seeds were packaged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today's March something teeth would put
March something teeth on that package so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it would say Arise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know which filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember what the cross is there just
for a backup plan in case I don't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: what Arise was or if I was high when I
wrote something down, I have another
[SPEAKER_00]: backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I know when those seeds were kind
of harvested, when I put them in that
[SPEAKER_00]: baggie is a good enough time frame for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me know which batch they were
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if you guys have a problem,
if I discover a problem, I know that this
[SPEAKER_00]: jar, this bag of seeds is where the
problem lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can crack that open, germ a bunch of
those and see what happens in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly excessively label your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put, like I said, the name of
the cross, the cross, the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I know how many seeds are in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got some special notes on it,
maybe I'll write that on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So label them, put them in a jar,
put them in a bag, put a desiccant pack in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, something that will suck up the
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep saying dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the seeds dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is a nightmare for a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture will ruin the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture will make the seed grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until you're ready, don't get it wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put it in a jar, put it in a bag with
your desiccant pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's keep the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistent, cool is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frozen is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot is not good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to store my seeds in a cool,
dry, dark environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want the seeds really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if I am comfortable,
those seeds are probably comfortable as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit colder than room
temperature, maybe low seventies,
[SPEAKER_00]: high sixties would be good for storing
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to keep them in the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool is good, but I don't like to freeze
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The refrigerator would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in your jar or a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put mine inside of a Grateful Dead
lunch box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds fucking cliche.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white hippie with dreadlocks keeps his
magic beans in a Grateful Dead lunch box
[SPEAKER_00]: in the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's one of those metal lunch boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the little metal clasp on the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pop it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a shit ton of seed packs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close it back up, throw it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays in the crisper drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mainly where I keep those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are well protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the seeds my seeds tend to stay in the
crisper drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may also be a safe somewhere that is
in a cool dark place that does not get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the seeds stay in the safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The safe is always dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature there is basically always
the same because of the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it in a place where you can keep the
temperature kind of regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why the temperature is
important and why I don't like the freezer
[SPEAKER_00]: and why possibly the refrigerator may not
be the choice for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are the kind of person that likes
to open and close your seeds and show your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends all your packages, the fridge or
the freezer is not the spot because think
[SPEAKER_00]: about what happens if you put a food
product in the refrigerator and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It develops condensation on the outside of
the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at one of my drinks here to
see if it was it's to the temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: just right in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take a drink out of the
fridge, right, there's no condensation on
[SPEAKER_00]: your bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take that bottle out of the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You crack it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a few drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to grab the bottle again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got condensation on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe possibly that could happen to our
seeds if we put them in the fridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them nice and cold, pull them out,
show them off to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be getting exposed to
condensation or moisture within that
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be moisture in the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how dry your seeds were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who sold them to you,
who packaged them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the moisture content of your
seeds before they were packaged in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moisture could could become
condensation when you take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be detrimental to your seeds in
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moisture could rupture your seeds if
there's enough moisture with the inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed and it does freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it reaches a certain temperature,
that could explode and pop the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen seeds allegedly get shipped
from Colorado to New York in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exploded in the bay of the fucking
cargo plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the seeds were ruptured.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had too much moisture in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They popped inside there like fucking
bubble wrap and popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those seeds were toasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't toasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were opposite of toasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were frozen to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to put the seeds in the
fridge, leave them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until it's time to grow them, don't be the
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to marvel at my seed collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some seeds that I'll pull them
out and I'll look at them and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, there's my, I've got all of the sub
cool stuff, all of the TGA stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: before sub cool passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull it out and just look at it and
just read the names and look at all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cool shit that I've gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss my buddy sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like looking at your baseball
cards or your sneaker collection or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're into your video games or
your hats or whatever you're into your
[SPEAKER_00]: purses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of people like to look at their
collection and share it and show their
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and the bros come over and you're
like, I got this and I got, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this from this company and I got
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just show it off and maybe you're
doing trading or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do that and bring them
out a lot, don't put them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then you do run that risk,
that opportunity, that potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: compensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you move them, every time you
take them out, put them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do give them that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you're making heat and cold
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a living organism that you're
trying to preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets warm, it's probably going to
start thinking, Ooh, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put it back in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fridge and confuse the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's got that kind of
memory, but that is something that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep your temperature consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know humidity spikes, definitely no
condensation, no moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I would not recommend freezing
them, but a lot of people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stored seeds for years in this
method, uh, in a baggie, uh, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lunchbox and the Chris bridge or the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had seeds in there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bust them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They germinate very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that seems to be a good method for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you are one of those people that
insists on showing your seeds to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your friends and you want to store them in
your refrigerator, uh, this may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: better way to do things anyway,
just because, um, just adds a level of
[SPEAKER_00]: security to yourself and your collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it keeps your friends honest and
it doesn't allow for any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe consider just taking all of your
seeds one time and making a fat list of
[SPEAKER_00]: them and saying, like categorize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all of this, uh, miss Jill,
I've got all of this, whatever other
[SPEAKER_00]: brands and breeders are into make a
strong, make a breeder and then list all
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit you've got from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe put regs and fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how many seeds are in each pack?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're real OCD about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, then when it comes time to
show off your trading or your seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about trading, you don't have to
bring out the stash and show everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just show them the list or take
pictures of all your cool shit and show
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody your pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, once again, when it comes time
to trade or sell seeds, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can't disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can't walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can't accidentally take a pack that
they didn't trade for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only give them a picture of what
you've got available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying your friends are going to
steal from you, but who knows one time
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody stole some seeds from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you are, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't call you no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope the seeds was worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause in the long run, dude, you would
have made so much fucking more money than
[SPEAKER_00]: stealing a fucking pack of seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not on the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I really don't have a lot more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've covered the basics of storing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them in a cool, dry, dark place,
somewhere secure, somewhere safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys work hard for your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend a safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a metal gun safe or
something like that, that is a great spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock them up under lock and key is the
best place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't bring them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell people where you're keeping
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of pictures of your seed packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if you want to share it with
your friends, you got all the pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you remember what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pull it out of the stash
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document what you've got, uh, right down
on the seed packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if they're packs you bought,
if there's seeds you made right down the
[SPEAKER_00]: date on that package, when you got it,
if you're making a spreadsheet,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you got those, put a date on there so
that you know how old those seeds are also
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe write down where you got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are some, uh, vendors that do
have older seeds, some vendors with newer
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there are some vendors with
Fugazi seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are buying, uh, just buckets of
seeds or people are just making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't stop anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seed company, a seed bank, uh,
the banks are the people that sell the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeders are the people that make
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a company makes them, the bank sell
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody would, there's nothing stopping
from somebody making a bucket of seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: just putting them in packages and saying
that these are this brand seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a company that's done it to
miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done it to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done it to a lot of the people in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim to be selling, I read genetics
or miss Jill genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's honestly just shit that they
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have no idea what the seeds
really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just package it up and they sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the consumer buys it and they send me
an email saying, Hey, I bought seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew the plants and they look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say, well, that's funny because
I've never sold any seeds to that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must not have sold you real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics and I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to where you're getting
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So write down where your seeds came from,
write down the date, what you got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if you run into problems,
you do have some sort of history,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of timeline to go back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are consuming a lot of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are just late night internet
shoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy our seeds at random times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't remember exactly when and where
we bought some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So write that on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the packages are fairly large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got your spreadsheet going,
put those details in the spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did I buy these seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did I buy them from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really OCD, write down what
you paid for them just for fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can watch, uh, I'm watching
the seed market move up and down right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some seeds that were worth a thousand
dollars last year are not worth much this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then seeds that weren't worth shit
last year are worth a lot this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great watching the market,
the breeders, the trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed X stock weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stock market of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun watching that move up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel like I've rambled out this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could have been a longer episode,
but there's no need to stretch it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've covered the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your seeds in a cool, dry,
dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in a jar or a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw that jar or baggie into a grateful
dead lunchbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into Pokemon, if you're into
Powerpuff girls, if you're into the X-Men,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're into Wolverine, whatever kind of
lunchbox you've got that will work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of people use a tackle box
or something similar, put it in a box that
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to keep the light off of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put those in the crisper drawer of the
fridge, or if you live in a cool place
[SPEAKER_00]: where it doesn't get too hot, too cold,
you can keep them in a drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a safe to where it's nice and
locked in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basement stays great here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a safe in the basement in
Colorado, I'd recommend putting your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in a safe in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be great year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperatures should stay pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like I'm just
rambling at this point to make the show
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to drag this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns, you know,

[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any topics you'd like to me to
like me to cover any grow questions you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to ask, I would love to hear from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check out the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link to the discord,
a link to seed vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow help tab there on that grow
help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do ask you a free, a few preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask what's up with your temperature,
your humidity, what you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: A few basic questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your grow scroll down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do give you the opportunity to explain
what is going on in your grow and ask for
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have grow problems or grow
help, if you've got a basic cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture question, a cultivation question,
skip all the part above, put your question
[SPEAKER_00]: right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer that for you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I haven't answered your message
already, please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a lot of focused episodes
on the silver thiosulfate and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be getting to more listener emails
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I save them up and make big episodes out
of those.

[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I've got for you for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a giant shout out to my friend
ADHD grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
