[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me
Rostichev, and this is episode 647 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can tell already that I have
sort of lost my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I woke up a few mornings
ago, I did not have any voice at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been drinking a lot of teas,
I've been taking a lot of vitamins,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get the voice back in shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's coming back, but it is
still not up to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast standards, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel sick, I don't look sick,
but for some reason, my voice is not
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make you listen to a long
podcast episode where I sound terrible,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm going to drop in a clip that I have
previously recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will find this clip
entertaining, I hope you find this clip
[SPEAKER_00]: educational, and I do thank you for
putting up with a short podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be back Monday with the normally
scheduled program, but until then,
[SPEAKER_00]: please enjoy this short episode of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Rostichev.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what episode number this is
going to be, but I do have an update for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about male and
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode previously on sexing our
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about how to sex them,
how to make them show you male or female,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know what I never did?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never showed you what a male or a female
cannabis plant looked like, and we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: talk too much about the anatomy or
functions of male or female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any notes in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a spontaneous random off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumble about male and female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we should do is talk about
male and female plants function in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis environment in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do female plants do?
[SPEAKER_00]: The female plants are the plants we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female plants make those sticky icky
buds, those sweet aromas, the big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets, the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are what we all are after.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the potency is hidden,
is in those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the female plants are what we seek in
our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you are breeding, unless you seek
to make seeds to pollinate your crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: male plants are not useful in most
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you want seeds in your garden,
I would say get rid of the male plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as you can identify a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the male plants produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen is applied or lands on a female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That female plant receives that pollen and
that plant will make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a male that produces
pollen and a female plant that is about 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to 28 days into flower, maybe a little bit
later, if the pollen from that male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: gets on that female plant that is in
flower, it's got to be in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, about 12, maybe a little earlier,
10 to 28 days, maybe 32 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that pollen gets on that plant,
that plant will finish with seeds inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we prevent those seeds is by
removing the male from the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I've stated before, as early as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to detect those boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to the sexing episode that will
tell you how to make your plants show you
[SPEAKER_00]: male or female a little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've talked about the function and
roles of the male and female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plant makes pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female plant makes buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds happen or the seeding happens if
the pollen touches that female plant
[SPEAKER_00]: during a crucial point in the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative plants do not produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative plants do not produce pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, you can't do any breeding with
vegetative plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got problems, accidental
pollinations or light leaks or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that in veg, you're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think this is the appropriate time
to talk about identifying male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems classy, and the female plants
are what we are after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now on the screen, I'm going to
display a classic picture of an early
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these little, I'm going to
call them hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the correct word, but
everybody can follow along with me right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little hairs sticking out,
these are the female pre-flower parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to pop up a picture of a
male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that looks like a little nub
right there, maybe a little wart,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a little thing popping out,
that is the beginning of a male flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: that part of the flower is going to have
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to place a picture of a female
plant that's a little bit further into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those little fuzzy hairs that you see
are the parts that would receive the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the pollen would land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, it would slide up into another
part of that plant, and it would make a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to go too far into
breeding terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're here for,
but those little fuzzy dandelion parts
[SPEAKER_00]: that you see, those are the female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's show you a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant on the screen now is a male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way I can describe it is,
you see those balls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those balls are what are going to produce
the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we need to get out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got those beautiful dandelion
looking parts, those are what are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are seeing those balls,
you have got yourself a male plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is time to get that dude out of the
grow room before he dumps his pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinates your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time those male plants will
drop their pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early guys will get going around day 10 of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the later going dudes will take 14
to 17 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind, if your male plant has
been stressed, if it wasn't getting enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light, if there was something off in that
grow room, maybe it got root bound,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe he just was eager to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they will begin to pre-flower
while they are still in veg if there are
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you put that bad bitch into
flower, put it under 12-12, it will say,
[SPEAKER_00]: ba-boom, and just in a few days it will
start dumping pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to pay very close attention to
our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning of flower, look every day
for the first 14 to 21 days to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you are identifying male and female
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is the dreaded intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to find a good picture of an
intersex plant that's got fair use rights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll display it on the screen right
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now you're looking at an
intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant has male and female parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant will be problematic in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those male plants, those male parts on
that plant open up and create pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will pollinate not only that plant
itself, but all of the other plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, and then you will have seeded
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, I don't like those
seeds because they come from a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was hermaphroditic, which is going to make
more hermaphroditic plants, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue the struggle in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
that is my brief report on identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: males, females, and intersex plants in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns, you know I would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to hear from you.
