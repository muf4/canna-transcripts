[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for episode 502 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting at the table with me, is this
counter fucking clockwise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting at the table is White Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Double Door Dank and Tall Clint are
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a super awkward intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the
show is brought to you by our friends at
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly,
[SPEAKER_02]: highly recommend Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds here now, and of course you can find
them at SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually start the show by talking about
what we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took some fat dabs of ice cream,
live batter from Green Dot Labs,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we've got a special treat at the table
tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, tell us about what we're dabbing or
what we're smoking over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a little bit of flower
from Lovin' In Her Eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some Lovin' In Her Eyes flower,
the lovely Lovin' In Her Eyes stopped by
[SPEAKER_02]: the booth at the Endo Expo and dropped off
some grape cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells fucking grape cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like fucking connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever seen Lovin' In Her Eyes'
photos, if you haven't looked yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: go look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovin' In Her Eyes on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: These buds are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is sparkly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fried.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stuck to my finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't put the weed back in the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is mine now, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stuck to my finger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cured perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say first, you know, I was very,
very impressed with her stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Lovin' In Her Eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful person, wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to meet her and her other half.
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed up at the booth at the Endo
Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an honor to meet them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an honor to be smoking some grape
cake grown by Lovin' In Her Eyes on the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for bringing that, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was lucky enough to get to trade her a
little bit of mine, so I'm hoping she
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoyed some of that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you get some feedback from her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's actually grown a couple of my
crosses now, so we may see some photos in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to wait to talk about this,
but since we kind of segued into that
[SPEAKER_02]: accidentally, let's do an update on the
Iri Genetics Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, I discovered that Instagram
fucked up the Iri Genetics Instagram page
[SPEAKER_02]: and made it, I was shadow banned really
strongly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they changed it to where it was only
viewable by viewers who were 21 years of
[SPEAKER_02]: age or older.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I discovered that most people
couldn't even see the page at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went poking around and found some
settings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've corrected some of the
settings and you should be able to view my
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram page now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we met you at the Endo Expo and
you've been trying to find my Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give me another chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Iri underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been posting a lot of high quality
cannabis photography, a bunch of Endo Expo
[SPEAKER_02]: photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please find me again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the Instagram update.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is traditional that we do some shout
outs to our friends from Patreon at the
[SPEAKER_02]: start of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give a giant shout out to our friend
Meredith.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give some shout outs to Steve Smith.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to send a giant shout out to
Rick Roller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a big thank you to Dabby Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a big thank you to Brett G and
Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also want to send some love to James
Brown, the hardest working man in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.

[SPEAKER_02]: All of the information you need will be

[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have covered most of the
important business part of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about this fun weekend that we
got to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a really cool team of friends
that came and helped me out at the Endo
[SPEAKER_02]: Expo this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been listening to the show,
you know that last weekend was the Endo
[SPEAKER_02]: Expo in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Endo Expo is they claim to be the
world's largest indoor cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all of the nutrient companies,
all of the lighting companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the seed companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was there, you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I missing?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any business tied to marijuana or
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we were missing like 8 or 10
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything but consuming accessories.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't much glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a vaporizer type of a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was clothing available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then also there was an entire hemp
pavilion that was focused on hemp and CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it had all of the cultivation covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get free samples of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get stickers from every company
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were plenty of people who did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of people got a lot of great
stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these boys, these gentlemen,
these wonderful men came and helped out at
[SPEAKER_02]: the IRE genetics booth at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe them a big thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys did a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of people visit the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big thank you to everybody that
came out and saw us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just stopped by and grabbed a
sticker, if you fist bumped us,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people just walked by and gave
that friendly nod because they didn't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to disrupt the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you came and spent a couple of bucks,
if you came and chatted our ears off,
[SPEAKER_02]: big shout out, big thank you for all of
the support to everyone who showed us love
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these guys did a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a couple of moments, it was
overwhelming for everybody, including
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to this type of a crowd and this
type of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh God, that's a lot of people
at the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to speed up our game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these guys took good care of
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that came to the booth,
they understood, like they can only help
[SPEAKER_02]: so many people at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wanted to meet Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the people wanted to shake my hand
and say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our booth wasn't the only line that ran
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, yeah, there were a lot of lines at
the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed that when I, people would
meet me, I'd say, Hey, do you listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd say yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, that's Clint and that's Mike and
that's double door dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people would be like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would want to meet you guys too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool to kind of share that love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause usually I do these events by myself
or with one other person who doesn't care
[SPEAKER_02]: to be noticed or anything who hasn't been
on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was cool to get you guys some love
and get you out there and get you some
[SPEAKER_02]: high fives.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool to meet a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really had a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, it was all positive experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was zero drama up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so nice meeting people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so fun meeting someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then them looking at me and going,
is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you would like tell them,
Hey, that's Clint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a pretty distinct deep voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about you being a tall guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get excited though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets a little higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming to the booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was forever known as helper monkey.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give us four passes for the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't sure who was going to be my
fourth helper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had somebody I was thinking about having
helped me, but then I thought that Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a better fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I registered the badge,
I just put the word helper monkey on
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's what they were going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we got away with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was all cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought until I registered and I got an
email that said, all right, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: registered helper monkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure to bring your ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what do I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I made it work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody was telling me how great of a
vertical light grower he was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah, he is, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a bad-ass guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy does a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I really thought it was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been going to these events for a long
time, years, high times, cannabis cups,
[SPEAKER_02]: Indo expos, dude grows cups, whatever you
want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about, I've probably been to the
event in Colorado, seven, 10 cups,
[SPEAKER_02]: secret cup, secret sash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hitting them for awhile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know most of the industry,
most of the seed breeders, most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, most of the Instagram people or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of these guys at the table,
Clint doesn't give a shit about
[SPEAKER_02]: celebrities and popular people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not his thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense to Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't care about that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That hype doesn't get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's got other shit on his mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when he meets famous people is like,
Hey, you're famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really, he doesn't get
superstar struck most of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's just human.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people, some people would meet me
and get starstruck and I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no bro, I'm, I got hungry today and I
pooped today, just like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes people would come to the
booth and say hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be somebody from the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, that I find to be kind of,
you know, somebody to look up to somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: who's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys would have no idea who the
fuck I'm talking to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'd be somebody that owns another
seed company that I've looked up to,
[SPEAKER_02]: or somebody that has inspired me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they would walk away and be like,
Hey, Matt, do you know who that was?
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd be like, no, who was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Oh, that's just this guy that
owns this company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, Oh my holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, these guys had no idea who
they were standing new, standing next to
[SPEAKER_02]: half the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they did, it was funny to
watch you guys get kind of starstruck a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty fun, especially Matt,
cause he's kind of still a little younger
[SPEAKER_02]: than me, new to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do follow a lot of the social
media stuff too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, you know, I spent like the last
couple of years just watching like certain
[SPEAKER_04]: people's page and like to get to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just showed up at the booth to come
say hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh, well a lot of people to hide
what they look like really well off of
[SPEAKER_04]: their Instagram, you know, purposely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't really have an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, you know, uh, loving in her eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can know it's a girl probably because
you know, it says her in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but half of the other ones, you don't
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a girl, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you're like, Hey, you know who
that was?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, no, who the fuck was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, well, that was this
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, who the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told you they're this on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have this thing where I'm not
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people's real names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people's Instagram names and I know
their email addresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I'm talking to three
different conversations, thinking it might
[SPEAKER_02]: be three different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes it hits me that,
Oh, this guy is also, this guy is also
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or sometimes I'm thinking I'm talking,
it's so hard to keep all the social media
[SPEAKER_02]: and real and email, all those
conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't know, maybe it's just me
being weird, but it's hard to keep all
[SPEAKER_02]: those names and faces together.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them I don't have faces for until
the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like getting to put a face to all these
emails finally is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of people that came up and
it's like, Hey, I'm on this on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was really cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, Oh, that's what you look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fun seeing what our
demographic looks like because I have no
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fun watching them discover that
we're all six foot something tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking at us like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: All four of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was super fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt said, uh, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basketball tournament.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I watched like a couple of them walk
by and just look like, Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all peaceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just, I didn't make myself six five.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just happened to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of people didn't realize I
had dreadlocks that were this ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty well tied up for the event,
but you can tell I got a lot of dreads up
[SPEAKER_02]: here and people were like, you got a lot
of hair, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's funny that the shortest
dude at the booth is six two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the tiniest dude there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're the helper monkey,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Clint said it best a moment ago,
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our friends from cannabis were at
the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Jr token.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I was wonderful to smoke some
bowls with you, spend some time with you,
[SPEAKER_02]: get some love on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran out of cannabis stickers and
pamphlets and Jr token fell from the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where he came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know where poof was at the corner
of the, uh, the booth there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like eight minutes after we realized we'd
ran out of a cannabis stuff to set
[SPEAKER_02]: stickers and pamphlets down, gave Mike a
fist bump and vanished into the crowd like
[SPEAKER_02]: a superhero again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, well, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just replenished us with advertising
and left.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy had a really good energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good conversation with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get to spend much time with that
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really great to spend some time
with him and a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I, Hey guys, if we got to hang out this
weekend, I'm not going to give everybody a
[SPEAKER_02]: shout out, but you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really means a lot to me to sit down
and, or even if it's at the booth and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: just shaking your hand for a moment,
it means a lot to me to shake your hand,
[SPEAKER_02]: to look you in the eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we shared a moment that does mean a
fucking lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it means a lot to you guys cause
you listen and you feel like you've been
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing me, but it means just as much to
me to meet you and sit down and shake your
[SPEAKER_02]: hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got to hang out with the embracing
organics crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hang out online, but to sit down and
actually smoke with those guys and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually be friends with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit is always fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it meant a lot to me to just hang out
with that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you came to the booth, if you
shared some energy with us, that means a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of work doing these shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of work being a breeder and
being, I hate to act like I'm somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: online, but a lot of people know who I am
and I get a lot of questions and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these types of events, all these hugs,
high fives, compliments, encouragement,
[SPEAKER_02]: fist bumps, simple nods, all that shit is
like a battery recharger and I fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You filled me back up for another six or
seven months worth of fucking energy like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow us on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to JR Token.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had so many fun people come to the
booth that I don't want to try to mention
[SPEAKER_02]: too many people cause we're going to
forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: People and miss stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had an overwhelming amount of support
this year from all kinds of companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different breeders would come by.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you really got the support and
kind of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday I took more selfies with people on
Sunday than I've taken all the past year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks if you came by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be the guy that was like,
I saw you, didn't want to come by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you brought a gift, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the table right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of gifts and freebies and love that people
brought to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are t-shirts, there's weed,
there's nutrients, there's a mug.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably enough t-shirts there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to do laundry for a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were super generous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one guy kept coming around with
some cookies and I, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's big Tim from Organico.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up Tim?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for keeping my crew medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Tim and Miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course a big shout out to Miss Amy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pleasure seeing all of the,
everybody that came up from New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of Albuquerque folks and New
Mexico friends out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised at the variety of places
people came in from, like New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona, Las Vegas, Philly, Illinois,
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend Lee came from London.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, London.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple of friends from Oregon.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Grozo.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was out there from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice crowds both days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I mean, a really great event.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your guys' favorite moment at the
Indo Expo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just go, let's go fucking left to
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike, did you have any standout
moments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Twice on Saturday, listeners to the show
know that this show and the Dude Grozo
[SPEAKER_01]: show do a lot to support each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scotty and the dude were at the expo and
stopped by our booth a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both times on Saturday that they stopped
by our booth for a minute while they were
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of standing on the right edge of our
booth at the left edge of our booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was somebody talking to Jeff who was
saying enthusiastically, I found you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: through the DGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love both your shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad I found you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so cool that you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the DGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love everything you guys are doing
together without any hint of awareness
[SPEAKER_01]: that Scotty and the dude are standing 16,
18 inches behind them.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happened twice in an hour,
within an hour from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a beautiful, fun convention
thing that I just, it's been amusing me
[SPEAKER_01]: since it happened, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smiling because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't watch the video show of
the Dude Grozo show, you don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: the dude and Scotty look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they were primary
listeners or if they were just,
[SPEAKER_01]: call it in the spirit of the convention
and not paying a lot of attention to who
[SPEAKER_01]: else was right around them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people were heavily medicated might
be the words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to tell them about the discovery
you made, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the jitter segregated vapor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like about 40 feet from our booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike pointed out that there was a gender
specific vape lounge just to the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it went in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Clint said, no, there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about 40, almost 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to a lot of events in Colorado
over the last four decades and never once
[SPEAKER_01]: has a bathroom ever smelled that nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was not bad to be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd open that door and it was like,
wow, it smells kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little foggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't figure out why there were a
bunch of urinals in the vape lounge,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I used them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was about 30 or 40 feet from our
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made for a really nice weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for these beautiful Green Dot Lab
[SPEAKER_02]: cartridges and pins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was also cool because I got
to finally meet the guy that runs the
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Dot Labs Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also Dreadlock White Guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been sharing a lot of posts or
posting a lot of photos of my Green Dot
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates and that dude shares my posts
and gives me a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really cool to finally meet the
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm saying earlier, it was fucking
nice to put some faces to all these
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram accounts and finally say,
Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of people give me a lot of
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give a special thank you to
my friend Jaren from New Millennium
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every event I go to, I bump into Jaren.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran into Jaren at the fish shows this
summer and hung out with him there and
[SPEAKER_02]: burned down with him one night at the fish
shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Jaren is just, we're destined to be
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see him at every event and he is much
more experienced at going to these events
[SPEAKER_02]: than myself, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he always makes me feel a little at
ease and a little comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when you find, like the first
day of school, when you're nervous and you
[SPEAKER_02]: find one of your friends, like fuck,
I got to go find Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: School sucks by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I see Jaren, I'm always like,
this event will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so shout out to Jaren.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought some New Millennium products to
the table so he could display them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I brought them home with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the event, that was a rental
fee for that space on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for the nutrients, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do big support for New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do that episode that I keep
telling everybody about the mix episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably going to be around episode
505.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not lying to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got thrown off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike's favorite moments were when the
dude and Scotty were standing there and
[SPEAKER_02]: people were telling me how much they love
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you, were you at least polite
enough to be like, well, that tall guy and
[SPEAKER_02]: that short guy, Beavis and Butt-Head right
there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cried twice, but both times the person
talking was a little bit starstruck and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were too into talking to you in the
moment to catch that there were other
[SPEAKER_01]: people around them at all, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was just, it was just a really
fun convention moment that, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was too perfect not to share with the
listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the dude and Scotty and also
to Guru.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good seeing all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Matt, you're over there packing
a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being a good helper monkey,
but it is time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's ask a man, what was your,
one of your favorite, or you can have more
[SPEAKER_02]: than one, but what were some standout
moments for you at the Indo Expo this
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of people who came by and
just the amount of love and the things
[SPEAKER_04]: they wanted to talk to you and take
pictures with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just kind of amazing to see like
how much support you have from all over
[SPEAKER_04]: the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was also like funny moments as
well where like somebody would come over
[SPEAKER_04]: just hammered drunk because even though it
wasn't like, you know, an open consumption
[SPEAKER_04]: event, they had a bar going, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure that guy was drunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that was alcohol,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, he might have just been
lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was definitely not on our plane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was tripping his face off is what I
think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I communicated, I attempted communication
with that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, if you're listening, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's totally cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't a fish show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have to adjust,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude was tripping his fucking peepee
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was hugging the table as he's talking
to me like about strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, well, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like hugging the table and I'm
like, I got I got to find you a chair is
[SPEAKER_04]: what I got.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was having a hard time putting his day
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tripping dude was your favorite part.
[SPEAKER_04]: That.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that and just being able to look
around at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had kind of a hangout session and being
able to look around and see like all of
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that, you know, are watching
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little after party at Frosty
McNuggets' house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I was supposed to say
that, but big shout out to Frosty
[SPEAKER_02]: McNuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: He threw an awesome after party that
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little basement bro-y,
but it was honestly exactly what I fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted that evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hang out with all of my friends
from Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hang out with Mike was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I don't have my hometown crew with
me, so I get to come back and tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys how much fun I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fun spending that with you
guys, kind of taking you to my world
[SPEAKER_02]: because I always come back and I'm like,
I did this, I did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds fantastical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you guys are like, holy shit,
he really does this stuff sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to come see it and experience
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Embracing Organics crew was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fumidor was fucking there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never get to hang out with Fumidor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my first time with Fumidor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dude Gros crew was there for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't all.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude couldn't make it, but Scotty was
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you said, to have all the
podcast crew there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of the DGC was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of the Airy Army was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pedro and Dizzy showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a cool fucking party.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was feeling the same kind of vibe that
you were like, this is all the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I only get to see them online.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of cool to just chill out
with them and actually pass a bowl around
[SPEAKER_02]: and take some dabs and fucking smoke
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a gathering of a lot of great
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was super nice and Clint was
there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcoming, you know, and Clint was there
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being very nice now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to make up for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a great guy, Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, thanks for your input.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move over to Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint, you already know the question,
I hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had such a good- What's your favorite
movie?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now I'm stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got me, Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever do that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was one of your favorite- Don't ever
ask me what my favorite movie is again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never do that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's fucking accurate too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was one or two or all of your
favorite moments at the Indo Expo this
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to meet so many cool people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was zero drama all weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throughout the whole weekend, you know,
we got to meet Theo Vaughn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So- We didn't even touch on that,
did we, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we'll get to that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, that was- You know what,
we'll just go for it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to go to a comedy show Friday and
that was Theo Vaughn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, I'm going to- Please tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ari, what was his opener or I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Ari Maness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari Maness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what was his opener's name?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the other guy opener.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one, Billy something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, really plain guy,
plain white guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, plain white guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is Mike's job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got to go see Theo Vaughn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to talk with him for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was cool as hell and there was a long
line behind us so I didn't want to take up
[SPEAKER_03]: much of his time so- Yeah, we're good at
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know just to shake hands, get a
picture, get the F out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave us good seats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was at the ComedyWorks South
Club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the landmark, not our normal club.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was nice seeing some faces that I
recognized from the other club that must
[SPEAKER_03]: just like go back and forth at like a
managerial level or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those guys are cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: New waitresses are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I hadn't been to this club
before so it was really fun to go to this
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a different feeling there but it
was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: A completely different vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a completely different feeling,
completely different setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were absolutely correct there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean to like take away from these
guys can't really comment on it so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: tough to- No, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to have a good segue to talk
about Theo.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a note right here that says Theo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Friday I went and set up for the
Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically put up the banner, threw up a
tablecloth and carried in a box of shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I met up with Clint and we got to
go see Theo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a pretty good show.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crowd was disruptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show was disorganized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Theo was in disarray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what you expect when
you go see Theo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's probably, it's like when
you go see a baseball game you expect to
[SPEAKER_02]: see dudes in baseball pants throwing a
ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: I expected to see exactly what I got when
I went to go see Theo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, his haircut says what he's gonna be
doing on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is basically absolutely all you gotta
say about that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That haircut tells you what you're gonna
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tight mullet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to meet Theo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun meeting Theo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a good picture with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took a couple of pictures with me
because the lighting wasn't right in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he went back for another photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had an artist actually make
sure that my photo was good before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we were first in line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he wanted to make sure that everybody
else's photos got, I mean, I thought it
[SPEAKER_03]: was smart as hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just he wanted to get the lighting right
on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way he can get himself and the
next person in the right spot every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to our friend Kelsey at comedy
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we met Kelsey at what show was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, who did we see?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was when Elliot Woolsey opened for who
do we see this recently?
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We was the last show at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met Kelsey there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll come to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This weekend is all that's on my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of the comedy show before
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did we see?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I second hand dabbed so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw Cheeto Santino.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were at Santino and we met Kelsey
because I had my Brody Stevens pin on my
[SPEAKER_02]: hat and she said, Hey, I like your hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told her positive energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I said something about enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're friends for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Kelsey.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got us some pretty decent seats over
there at the comedy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite perfect seats, leg room and a great
view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leg room at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to check out this other spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a thing at the original
location.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks to our friends at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Frosty McNuggets for
throwing that party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to everybody that showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was that your favorite part of Clint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the comedy show and all the cool ass
people you got to meet?
[SPEAKER_03]: That stood out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the cool people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody had such a good vibe to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the whole event was like fairly
well run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see any like huge problems or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there wasn't a lot of food going
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could have been better maybe for next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely could have used some food
vending inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe we just didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was so many people there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food vending inside would take up booth
space for exhibitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The expo was massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two days there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to walk around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I only saw maybe 20 percent of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a subway inside the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cafe inside the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's food.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys didn't find the subway.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were hanging out at the booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it to the booth and to the men's
vape lounge is as far as I got all
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to go see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to go hang out with Colin Gordon
for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't get to go see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to go see a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a quick stop at the Oregon Elite
Seeds booth and the Seeds Here Now booth
[SPEAKER_02]: just to say, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them hugs because we work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was back at the booth as quickly as
I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was nervous away from the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like my post was left unmanned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I trust you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was still like, man, I got to be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: My face is on the fucking banner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was waiting to get back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It honestly felt like a mad rush for seeds
this year as far as people going to the
seed companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a number of other people mention
that the crowds were good around each seed
[SPEAKER_01]: booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was people who were doing other stuff
like heavy high end extraction equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pretty much all uniformly
mentioned seed companies look like that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hot spot this month.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it always is at those events.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they spread us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you noticed, it was about
every opposite sides and about three down
[SPEAKER_02]: from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time there'd be a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew what they were getting into.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the third or fifth endo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can't remember how many there,
but there are so many of these events and
[SPEAKER_02]: they do them in the same building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they all look the same to me,
not to be eventist, but it's just a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of booths with fucking people and like the
cup and the expo and they all look the
[SPEAKER_02]: same by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how many there have been,
but yeah, the seed breeders, that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all got our fair share.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I love that nobody,
like we all had basically the same nice
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I talk about it, like they're bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's going to like certain bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so nobody got all of it and nobody got
left out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty cool that we all got a
fair amount of business this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint, did we wrap up your part?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was, that was everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just shout outs to everybody that
came by and everybody was really super
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you were pitching the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard to everybody and doing a really good
job with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bet you there are 20 to 50,
maybe a hundred people listening right now
[SPEAKER_02]: because you gave them a grow from your
heart podcast flyer and you guys helped
[SPEAKER_02]: out with that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking thank you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to grow this thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you guys will play it in the,
I mean, the grow lessons are just so
[SPEAKER_03]: valuable that I, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please go back and listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Target audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were hitting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were there that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of some of my favorite stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the event, I just loved all the people
that wanted to fucking meet me,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said it's recharging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's overwhelming because that's a lot of
people to meet and hands to shake and hugs
[SPEAKER_02]: to give and names to try to fucking
remember, but it feels so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just all the social recharge that a
person needs just to feel good about
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big ego boost and a big,
uh, if I were like a SIM video game,
[SPEAKER_02]: my social meter would just be filled up
for the next fucking four months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cool on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this year was the first year we
brought our own big booth to the event
[SPEAKER_02]: before I've shared with other vendors and
other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done things with other companies
and I wasn't there by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't put our name on the booth this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought just out and proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought my banner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought my crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hired the team that I wanted there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be, we did it your guys is fucking
the way you guys had fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, here are the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how much they cost to make this
shit happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fucking not kind of guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let you guys do what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all worked enough retail in enough
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like that, that we all just dropped
into a pro rhythm right from the gym.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it went pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Clint's not super well versed in seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was doing well at pitching the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is pretty well versed at seeds and
has been a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was doing pretty good with strain
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were finding your niches and
doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helper monkey over here was super popular
because of his vertical grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, people wanted vertical grow advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They remembered him from the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just spunky too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, man, I'm sure you met, you met a cool
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you met up with one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our friends, I'm not going to spill
too much of your beans, but you made a
[SPEAKER_02]: really good contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of proud of you for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this guy's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He kind of takes what I do and,
uh, well I don't want to give too much way
[SPEAKER_04]: on him, but he kind of does it on a bigger
scale than what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll share that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The time is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple of really cool
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there are a couple of things you guys
heard of that are coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully if they email back, there will
be some really cool opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my other favorite things that
happened this year at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, it was kind of segue into this and
I got my, I sidetracked my damn stone
[SPEAKER_02]: self.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first year we brought the big
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I bought the team
and the crew and it wasn't me joining
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody else like the little dog in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this community, there is, um,
people try to act like there's a hierarchy
[SPEAKER_02]: and people are better than people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how every industry is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every business goes that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every click, every community this year,
some of the people that have had their
[SPEAKER_02]: noses up to irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fucking put their heads down and
looked me in the eye and nodded their
[SPEAKER_02]: heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they finally like, they realize we're
fucking here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint kept saying it as a kind of a funny
joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of the day, Sunday,
we were tired and high and exhausted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the end of Sunday, Clint's pitch
was we're irie genetics and we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking around, but that's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, people finally realized we were
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're something real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is the first event when people
went, oh shit, we can't, we see them
[SPEAKER_02]: coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're, we're there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got on the team.
[SPEAKER_02]: They let us in this team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting at the big voice table.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would literally watch people circling
because you had so many people wanting to
[SPEAKER_04]: take selfies with you and just meet you
that they would circle around and you'd
[SPEAKER_04]: see them come back 10 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, okay, just finally free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go talk to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see him light up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great feeling, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't get to see that cause I,
I don't get to look past like two people
[SPEAKER_02]: and I see the guy I'm talking to and I
kind of make eye contact with the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: behind him and not like you're going to be
next bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I let them know that I acknowledge
them and I just try to focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's fucking great to know
that people are looping around and coming
[SPEAKER_02]: back and enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, even a lot of company
support as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't even just like, you know,
average people.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of companies who are super
stoked on, you know, our booth and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, just being a part of, you know,
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Veg Bloom came by, New Mill came by.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a really cool zip up hoodie from New
Mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing is so cozy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conversation happened five or six
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: With different people, they'd come up and
go, Hey, Jeff, I just want to introduce
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so and so I run blank companies,
Instagram, and you guys would go,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's fun to finally meet those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been interacting, you know,
every other day for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They send me products and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the products and I've been growing
like new millennium neutral.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that guy for a while, but like,
yeah, I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Oh, uh, uh, green dot was
the main one that I was like, bro,
[SPEAKER_02]: we talk like every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just kind of, it was kind of
fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's just a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a dreaded white guy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was even more fun to be like,
Hey, two dreaded white guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: High five.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just funny for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we know that everybody's watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's extra funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a, there was a lot of that and,
uh, real energizing getting to meet a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of fans of the show coming up,
just wanting to say hi and shake our
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the people at the booth next to
us were confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really energizes our, the desire to do the
show and do it well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was funny though.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people next to us just not getting
anything going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just had a constant like crowd of
people and they had free food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you, how do you not, I mean,
I really appreciate everybody coming out,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they were super nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were super nice guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody at the event was super nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hang out with swerve from the
Cali connection and just spend a few
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude's been at it since before we
were, while we were all figuring it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was doing it already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hang out with James Bean from
seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome because we do a lot of work
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got to meet a lot of, I got to see
covert from covert genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to see old Chris Casas and to see a
bunch of people that we don't normally get
[SPEAKER_02]: to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we made a lot, we made a lot of good
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a lot of great gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, got a lot of business cards,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be long email and session on
today and tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, uh, swayed through emails
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, it was a fun expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you missed it, you missed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should definitely, uh, be on it for
next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The endo expo pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a lot of people on like the Friday
and Thursday before it saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how do I get into expo passes,
bro, bro, for like six months before the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of those people start flooding people
with emails and advertisements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't sleep on it next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's, uh, let's tell them finally,
uh, what they missed out on since you
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't release what you were going to do
before the expo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's tell them what free packs they
missed out on everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people saw it on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was giving away free packs of GMO to
arise to everybody that came to the booth
[SPEAKER_02]: and bought a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, free GMO to arise with almost
every purchase, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we tell them about the other cool
thing we gave away?
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we give away, Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friends at PL grow systems were kind
enough to give away a PL minder unit to
[SPEAKER_02]: the person who spent the most money at my
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a random surprise for somebody
that, uh, I know that person's happy right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he's he almost had, he didn't want
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wouldn't look at me because he had a
little, little drippy of a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: tear in his eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he wasn't my friend, I wouldn't say
that out loud like that, but he had a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad his beard was hiding his tears,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday, big fella.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody here at the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were picking on you only because we
fucking love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your family, uh, give you a big hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only roast the ones we love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rub my beard on yours and we'd
change beard fungus and we'd be bros
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I only wanted to bring that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So next year people, uh, they know they
know, you know, get there early.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't the only booth giving away cool
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of that going on this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every booth was giving out some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you didn't get enough stickers at
the event, you weren't trying hard enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were stickers for days.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, I feel like we've rambled
for close to 40 minutes on an endo Expo
[SPEAKER_02]: recap.

[SPEAKER_02]: We got to talk about all the wonderful
friends we saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we got to talk about, uh, all the

monkey did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: This crew up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, that was the other thing is
that's why just zero drama between the
[SPEAKER_03]: four of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that extravagant dinner Saturday
night that we had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that fucking awesome?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were very welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Mike was, Mike couldn't make
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike went to dinner with somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went out and met up with a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you guys all have for dinner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we went to the hotel room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first we took fucking allegedly Matt
and I took gnarly dabs in the car,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like off the property of the hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made sure because my hotel,
they remind me six or eight times in my
[SPEAKER_02]: check in process that I can't consume
cannabis in around near or while I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about that hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, you can leave here and do
whatever you want, but please don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: get your pipe out in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go off their property and we may
have got heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we were doing that, uh,
bro, I ordered fucking pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sat on the fucking chairs in the room
with no shoes on and we just ate pizza
[SPEAKER_02]: like lazy bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the most perfect dinner we
could have had.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd been on our feet and around people
all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was basically silent other than a
couple of good pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's even funnier because you
were staying in like a fucking five star
[SPEAKER_04]: hotel and there's these four dirty stoners
fucking eating or three, three of us
[SPEAKER_04]: eating pizza and this perfect super baller
fucking place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was exactly what we needed at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needed some pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
