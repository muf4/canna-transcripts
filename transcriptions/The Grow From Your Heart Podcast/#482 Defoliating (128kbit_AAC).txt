[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 482 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start this podcast off by
talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Curacao,
live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of coin style and dehesion
punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
vanilla fruit chew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have talked about this concentrate
on the podcast before, but I really like
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing the Curacao live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say that it tastes like a vanilla
fruit chew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the description I gave
last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that I just took a nice low temp
dab out of a freshly cleaned rig with a
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh brand new nail, and it tastes a
little bit like a candy corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are going to say that's gross
because I don't like candy corns,
[SPEAKER_00]: but imagine if you could eat a candy corn
and not have to taste that waxy bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without that waxy shit, I think a candy
corn would taste really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that vanilla candy flavor,
it's got a hint of a fruity flavor at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end, and this Curacao live batter left a
really nice sweet vanilla flavor on my
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue, and I am absolutely enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the perfect Curacao live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
pimps and hoes, friends and foes,

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be

[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's jump right into talking about
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of questions asking about how
and why and when to defoliate our ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers have a lot of opinions on
defoliating cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I will tell you when and
how to properly defoliate your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do that part, let me explain to
you why I feel like defoliation is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should start by basically
explaining what do I mean by defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean taking off excessive leaves in your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any leaves that are too large,
that are blocking light, that may become a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem in the future, I take those leaves
off early in flower, if not late in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first reason is to allow light to
penetrate my canopy and get to potential
[SPEAKER_00]: bud sites and bud sites for better growth
and bud development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goal is to grow big, potent,
quality buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can remove some leaf and put some of
the light on more of the buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: spend more of the energy on growing buds
and less energy on growing leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the potential to increase the
overall harvest weight and the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to take off excess leaf to get
more light into the canopy, more light to
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds and potential bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to remove excess leaf to allow
more air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in large scale commercial
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air flow is important on any size of scale
you are growing, but it gets much more
[SPEAKER_00]: critical as we get into larger
environments and larger rooms and larger
[SPEAKER_00]: buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: By removing excessive foliage,
we can create better air flow throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating better air flow through the
environment will have several advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help us regulate humidity in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to regulate humidity in the
grow room will help us prevent issues like
[SPEAKER_00]: bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also help us prevent issues like
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by removing excess leaf, we help to
reduce humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have less opportunity for things
like powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also give ourselves less opportunity
for bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we remove all those excess
leaves, we also give ourselves less
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a bunch of leaves,
if you don't have a bunch of excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage, there are less places for bugs to
hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it much easier to treat for pests
if you do have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it much easier to spray
preventative sprays to make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're defoliating, if you do
have a problem, you will absolutely notice
[SPEAKER_00]: a pest infestation while you're doing the
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those are three basic obvious
advantages of defoliating our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I've said before, this becomes
more necessary as we increase the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow spaces and the number of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that strategic defoliation
will heavily increase the productivity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and will also increase the
overall product harvest weight and
[SPEAKER_00]: potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be several advantages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also make trimming much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will speed up the trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did spend a few days in the grow
peeling off leaves before the trim crew
[SPEAKER_00]: ever got to it, but this will speed them
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is that many less leaves that make it
to the harvest phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why I defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of people have this mentality
that the leaves are what hold the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, we feed the shit out of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are spending a lot of money on
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are feeding high quality nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mixing up high quality soils and
soilless mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're feeding that to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting fed plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not out in the wilderness trying
to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need those excessive leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what is going to eat from those
leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who's going to live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who's going to feed off of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's help ourselves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it in a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in my opinion, proper strategic
defoliation can have many great benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move toward talking about how I
do my defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of very important steps
to preparing for a proper defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: session.
[SPEAKER_00]: One requirement is good music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need proper music for a proper
defoliation session.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, you can get
tunnel vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a large room and very long rows
that I tell four or five guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, your whole goal for today is to
defoliate this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it like a level three defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't strip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a pussy, but get in there and
pull off a bunch of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a bunch of five gallon buckets
worth of leaves coming out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen is the guys will take a
little break.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one of the requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is acceptable for you to medicate,
you've got to get baked before you
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's your thing, get plenty baked,
then put on good music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next thing that I'm going to say
you need is gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're defoliating, take me seriously
on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always need gloves when you are
defoliating plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get back to this music part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I want people to have good music
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the guys in the big grow tend to
get a little bit of tunnel vision and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will work on one area of the grow room
really heavily and they will forget to
[SPEAKER_00]: move to the next table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have 20 tables in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them will be very well defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 18 need a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: They forgot they were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tell the guys put on a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put in earbuds,
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put on the big
Bluetooth speaker that everybody can hear,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But put on some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some regular music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't listen to Fish or the Grateful Dead
because this technique won't work with
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish or the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their songs are way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on your Pandora or whatever you're
playing today and just let it play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of each song, move down a
few feet or move down to the next table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that by the end of the day,
you've got to get this whole room done and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get too stuck on one table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I tell the guys put on music
and then move after each song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to another section, move down,
move six feet, move to another table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make progress every song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason I tell them to do that is
because I don't want them to strip one
[SPEAKER_00]: section really heavily and then we have to
come back tomorrow and strip a couple more
[SPEAKER_00]: sections really heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather them strip the entire room
really lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll come back in a few days and
we'll do the entire room really lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I don't have, like I keep saying,
section one, tables one, two and three are
[SPEAKER_00]: butt naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no leaves over here, but tables
four through 20 are coated in leaves still
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's all furry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have different humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have problems in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are not consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like uniformity in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tell the guys go through and give it
all a level one strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time the guys nail it because
they know what I expect from them by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been trained pretty well,
but they usually go through and they give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a nice little strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't strip them to where they're
naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, they aren't too pussy about it
and leave too many leaves and leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: real furry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know right where to go take off those
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I do want it a little bit more,
I just tell them go back through and just
[SPEAKER_00]: do another quick strip and they can just
go through and do another quick strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they don't go too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they don't take too many leaves
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always take more leaves off,
but you can never put more leaves back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another great segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be amazed at how quickly these
leaves grow back and replace themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your grow environment,
depending on your genetics and depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on your nutrients, you may cut off these
leaves and in four or five weeks or five
[SPEAKER_00]: days, the plant will be twice as leafy as
it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good sign that is showing
that that plant is productive and that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also means that in four or five,
maybe six or seven days, we have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: back in there and pull those leaves off
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still on the first layer of
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, I would recommend no matter
what size your grow environment is,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're working in a four by four tent
or if you're in a hundred light room,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend starting with a light,
nice, even defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go back and defoliate every
few days in light phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're new and you're just
learning how to do this, you may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick one plant and defoliate the living
shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to pick another plant and
go kind of hard, then pick another one and
[SPEAKER_00]: go medium, then pick another one and go
real light and then pick another one and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't defoliate and then treat those
plants exactly the same otherwise and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how you like the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the plant that you defoliated all the
way, does that one grow better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that you didn't defoliate?
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice differences if you do
tests like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am skipping ahead on my notes a
little bit here, but defoliation will be
[SPEAKER_00]: very strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also depend on your lighting,
your nutrients and your overall grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are getting a lot of light
and a lot of quality nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see a lot of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're under smaller lights or your
plants are lacking in nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may not see as rapid leaf development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So defoliation will depend heavily on your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm skipping ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me keep myself on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about defoliating your grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say maybe you've got a five by
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got one light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are looking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be in a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have sticks holding them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not have any supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work for just about any type of
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my strategy for defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in the veg cycle, I like to pull all
the crap off the bottom of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: any little sucker branches, any little
leaves that look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really clean the plants up about two
weeks before they go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily bottom and lollipop
the plants in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave most of the branches on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mainly do just a defoliation and kind of
a those little sucker branches that are
[SPEAKER_00]: only a quarter of an inch long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just kind of starting to
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull all that crap off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that the light isn't going to
reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take all that crap off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to help the energy move to
the top of the plants and those tops can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and get bigger and beefier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're going to get our big
fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my defoliation will start late in veg,
about two weeks, maybe a week before we go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, depending on the strain and the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plant may be 12 inches tall coming
out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on the bottom three or four
inches of that plant are going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned up pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the little starts and sucker shoots
that are sticking out off those branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to clean those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave the ends of the branches there
and leave all the foliage up the ends of
[SPEAKER_00]: the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just going to clean off the
bottoms so that the bottoms of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of leaf area down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of sucker branches
down there wasting nutrients, wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and not getting any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part's not going to grow for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just clean it right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this will start sending energy up to
the tops of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to start growing a
little more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting ready to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first day I put them into flower is
when my defoliation really starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day one of flower, I like to begin a
very strategic defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do I mean by strategic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to remove the biggest leaves in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably my first targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally remove any leaves that are
blocking light from getting to a bud site.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a branch that will develop
buds on it and that branch is being
[SPEAKER_00]: blocked by a leaf and not being allowed to
get sufficient light, you can pull that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf off and let the light get to the bud
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to grow more buds, not more
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any leaves that are acting like an
umbrella that are shadowing buds or bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sites below them, I will remove those big
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I tell the guys in the
commercial facilities is take off any leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: with a purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big leaf about the size of
your hand and it's got a little purple
[SPEAKER_00]: stem on it, that leaf can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that leaf on the plant,
but I do make a couple of exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave the leaves at the very
tops of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a couple of colas that are
sticking up at the top, you will always
[SPEAKER_00]: see me leave the leaves at the very tops
of those buds on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that is a visual thing for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's an OCD thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in me makes me think that the
plants want those first few leaves at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not blocking a lot of light
from getting to the lower parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, I will leave those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they look really good and
something in me feels weird when I remove
[SPEAKER_00]: just those top two or four big leaves from
the top main buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that is just something inside
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that the plant says to
me, I have no science behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a personal thing that I have
noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels weird to me to take off those top
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave those on until just before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take those leaves off at the very
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is my one weird exception when it
comes to defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take off most of those giant
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start by removing every leaf with a
purple petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you want to dial in your
defoliation for optimal light penetration,
[SPEAKER_00]: here is a very good technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this depends on the quality and power
of the light which you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using thousand watt lights,
your lights are going to penetrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy much more deeply than if you're
using a 400 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your defoliation will depend again on
your lighting and your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can do, I like to put my hand
in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reach right into the middle of the
canopy and see, is the light hitting my
[SPEAKER_00]: hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the light isn't getting to my hand,
what leaves above my hand are blocking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if I feel like the light should be
getting that far into the canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will remove the leaves that are in the
way that are not allowing that light to
[SPEAKER_00]: get down to those bud sites that I want to
get nice and fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got any leaves acting like an
umbrella that are covering up a bud site,
[SPEAKER_00]: just feel free to pull them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be very beneficial to that bud
site below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you do have to consider the power of
that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of penetration do you
realistically expect from that light?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only defoliate so heavily to allow
more penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need to remove stuff from the
bottom because it is not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: light no matter how many leaves we remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to talk about that in a
future episode when we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: bottoming and lollipopping and popping and
twisting the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused here on defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a thousand watt light and
it's a few inches above the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you feel like that light should
probably penetrate 18 to 24 inches into
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy, put your arm in there about 18
inches in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your 6 to 12 inches from the
light as the top of your canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go down another 18 inches,
and that's where we're hoping to get light
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the light touching your hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there a bunch of shadows over your
hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Move your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to move around
branches and you're going to have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some adjusting, but move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting light on your hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you can probably defoliate a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've said this at the start of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go in there and crazily defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how leafy your plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what genetics you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what type of nutrients you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of light you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of VPD you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how leafy you're starting
with, and I don't know how the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and just do a level one
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how big your room is,
so I don't even know how many leaves you
[SPEAKER_00]: should expect to pull out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go pull a bunch of leaves and just
look in there and say, does it look like
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how the plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in two or three days, do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep doing it until you think,
huh, those look a little bit bare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start thinking they kind of
almost look like I took too much off,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably right where you want to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you can always take off more
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot glue the leaves back onto the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take off a few leaves here on day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new, wait a few days,
maybe three, maybe five days and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're comfortable with taking off more
leaves, do that and repeat that process
[SPEAKER_00]: until you are comfortable with the art of
defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you are comfortable with it,
I recommend a defoliation at the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go semi-hard at week one because we
want to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't taken any leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big, thick, jungly mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get in there and shave her up
for the very first time and make her look
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week one, we're going to go semi-hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three, we're just going to go back
and kind of clean up what has regrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again at week five, we're starting to
get bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see where all the buds are going to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I will clean off any of the
small sucker branches that I'm sure are
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to make it into anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that got left behind on previous
cleanings and bottomings, that's all going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get removed at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I will do a medium heavy
defoliation around week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to go back around week
seven and I'm going to do the final
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this one is fun because we are
getting big, sticky buds at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your arms are going to get sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your shirt's going to get sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear proper gloves and clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really recommend long sleeve shirts when
you're in there defoliating because when
[SPEAKER_00]: that resin starts sticking to your arm
hair, it really becomes uncomfortable and
[SPEAKER_00]: it is really a bitch to get off if you
don't know grower tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on week one, we're going to get in
there and we're going to remove everything
[SPEAKER_00]: with a purple pedial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use our hand to reach into
the canopy and see if the light is
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching our hand or our arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, we'll remove a few more
leaves to try to make that light get to
[SPEAKER_00]: those lower bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower and you're not
comfortable with a strong defoliation,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a light defoliation and pay attention
to the plants and then keep pulling leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: as you feel comfortable and you will gain
confidence as you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that plant doesn't die and you see it
increase productivity because of your
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling of leaves, you will gain
confidence and you will want to go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and remove more leaves and then you
will find that balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day you'll pull too many and you'll
go, oh, I pissed it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and experiment and learn
the balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get comfortable, we'll do a hard
strip on week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on week three, we go back and we
clean up the stuff that has started to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are starting to see where the bud sites
are popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we have probably bottomed
and lollipop the plants so you know how
[SPEAKER_00]: far your bud sites are going to be up on
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how far you expect the
penetration from the light to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got a really good idea of
what needs to be defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week three, you will have a lot of
contact confidence and a lot of tips from
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment and the plants themselves
on what to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on week five, that is a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to go in there and we see all the
buds getting chunky and now we can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves that are obvious over the bud
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more leaves have grown back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the older leaves have gotten
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take off all the crap that is
blocking the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're doing every defoliation,
carefully look for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully look for issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're defoliating, when you're doing
anything with the plants, the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: task on your mind is looking for issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on week five, we go in there and we
pull out all the big leaves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: covering up bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on week seven, we are getting ready
for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only got maybe one, maybe three more
weeks at the most until we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be beginning to see yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely remove those as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: At week seven, I like to take off the
majority of the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying go slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this point, we're going to go in there
and pull off most of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a day or two before harvest,
I send the trim crew in and they do a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-harvest strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take off all of the giant leaves and
they will also take off a lot of the sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't mention this before,
99% of this defoliation is done by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not using scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grab the leaf and just pop it right
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the guys are so quick that it is
scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit the microphone in the
speed that these guys pull leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell them, one, two, three,
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got good music on and they're
nice and motivated and they know the job
[SPEAKER_00]: and they know how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just get in there and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get good at it, you will be a
defoliation monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just use your thumb to kind of grab
that leaf and just pop it right off of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, once you get comfortable and
develop experience, you will also develop
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of confidence and you will start to
see the results of your defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will start to learn how to dial it
in for each strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some strains may not react super well
to defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strains that don't have a lot of
leaves may not respond well to a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn to be plant
specific when it comes to tricks like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you understand the main
goal and you don't go too hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will become very good at defoliating
your cannabis garden in no time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main idea here is just take off all
the extra leaves and you will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what those extra leaves are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to identify anything with
a long purple petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take that right out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've got a bunch of leaves at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do with all of these
leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people choose to juice their leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are spraying any type of
pesticide, please do not juice your
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not give them to anybody to be
juiced.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've sprayed pesticides or essential
oils, do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to juice that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use their leaves in
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a way to compost your
leaves, that is a great way to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a no-till garden,
if you're doing recycled beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: just throw those leaves right into the
compost, right into the recycled soil
[SPEAKER_00]: beds, or you can just drop them right into
the no-till garden and then they will
[SPEAKER_00]: decompose and they will become energy and
food for your plants and for your worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were going to throw away these
leaves, be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks extremely suspicious to see a
trash bag with pot leaves in it sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: out by the curb when you're waiting for
the trash man to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just imagine you take that bag of
trash out there and it's super fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then some punk-ass kid comes by and
he's on his bike and he hits the trash bag
[SPEAKER_00]: with his bike and the pegs go right
through the bag and now your trash bag's
[SPEAKER_00]: open and now right in front of your house
is a bunch of weed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you are, it only takes
one leaf to cause giant problems for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and your future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, be very careful with what you do with
these leaves once they're defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that overall when you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do with all of the
trash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to compost it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a wood chipper?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to happen to all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get rid of it safely
and not get yourself into any trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've covered the basics of
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you take the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strategically, I like to do it at the
start of week one of flower, the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: week three, the start of week five,
the start of week seven, and then I even
[SPEAKER_00]: do a pre-harvest defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to learn your plant specifics
on how hard to defoliate these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main goal is to remove excess leaves
to make more room for light to penetrate
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that will help control your
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also going to help prevent things
like powdery mildew and bud rot and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: also going to make less hangout spaces,
less party zones for pests like spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites and thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I hope that explains defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I work in a commercial environment,
the day after I defoliate, I generally do
[SPEAKER_00]: some popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in a future episode, we're going to
have to talk about popping and twisting
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will also talk about bottoming and
lollipopping our ganja plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: increased production.
