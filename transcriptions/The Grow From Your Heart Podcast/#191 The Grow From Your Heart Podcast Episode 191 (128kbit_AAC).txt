[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to all of our sponsors for
making this show possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before we go any further,
I want to say thanks to a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge thank you to Mr. Omnio from
Twitter and also Rich Milahan from
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud to have your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for something on a Facebook
feed and I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent about an hour searching through
Facebook, looking for it, and I posted
[SPEAKER_00]: that I needed help, and Rich found it in
about 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Omnio, you contribute to the show
via Twitter, whether you know it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a huge thank you to
everyone who's left comments on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to go read the iTunes
comments to you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one says, nice find by Todd,
that's T-O-D-D-D-D, Todd with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd says, I really like the tone of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never too serious and never boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I laugh and learn and laugh again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make people learn and making you
laugh is just a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a goofy dude, so glad that
comes across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is awesome by Lama Box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lama Box, that's a cool ass name,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, loving the show, telling about
the culture from the front lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment is from our friend,
Logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, great listen, great podcast,
always fun listening to Jeff's stories on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish I learned about this podcast sooner
and met the man himself during my short
[SPEAKER_00]: trip to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't worry, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be back to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get to meet me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to all the cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a dab for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all the people that left
comments on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave comments on iTunes,
I'll try to read it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also find the comments on Stitcher
and read those on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put the comments all in one
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay on each episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless I go search back through the
episodes, I won't find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to leave a comment on
iTunes or Stitcher, you can send me a
[SPEAKER_00]: tweet at gregoroculture or of course you
can find me on Facebook and I'll respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to say something anonymously,
you can always send me a personal message
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will keep your name private.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bust you out on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say your name if you ask me not
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to send mad love to everyone at
the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are my home away from home,
my family away from family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to be part of your circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to call each of you my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the Garden of Whedon lost a
brother recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was taken from us tragically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to take a minute and say
goodbye to Danny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read a beautiful post that
was written by our friend Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This post says, and I may tear up because
he was a cool bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, we've lost a great brother and
part of our crew living and experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado with you and your family has been
a blessing to all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danny always had so much positive energy
and brought so much fun to our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a new walk in the front door
with the yellow vitamin water and dad bag
[SPEAKER_00]: in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearts go out to you and your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love you and miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will all grind that much harder for
you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag country bearded dabbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Country bearded dabbers was something that
Danny and a few friends came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're the North Carolina boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danny was always a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind of a friend of a friend,
if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was introduced to him by the Garden
of Whedon crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the first time I met him,
he treated me just like I was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, always a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a fad dab for Danny and
we'll be back with the rest of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now back with the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some good news to report this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from vox.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vox explains everything you need to know
in two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is written by German Lopez
and it was written on May 30th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: House of Representatives late Thursday
passed a measure that would prohibit the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government from interfering with
state's medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bill is the first time in history
that any chamber of commerce has acted to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect medical marijuana businesses and
users.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also got bipartisan support.
[SPEAKER_00]: 170 Democrats and 49 Republicans voted in
favor of the bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The measure was attached to a funding bill
for several federal agencies and it blocks
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Justice and Drug
Enforcement Administration from using
[SPEAKER_00]: funds to prevent states from implementing
their own medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The measure, however, will require
approval from the Senate and President
[SPEAKER_00]: Barack Obama.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate is expected to pass its own
funding bill so the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment will need to survive through
both chambers' reconciliation process and
[SPEAKER_00]: then obtain Obama's signature to become
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're two steps away from getting these
fuckers to quit fucking with us and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting us do business and grow our herb
and take care of our patients and do what
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to rattle the cage too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article says still, marijuana
legalization advocates praised the House's
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a historic vote and it's yet
another sign that our federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: is shifting toward a more sensible
marijuana policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vote, while historic and a bit
surprising even to advocates, is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the federal government's ongoing shift
toward more liberal marijuana policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few weeks ago, the feds increased
how much marijuana can be grown for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: President Barack Obama and his
administration have taken steps to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate prosecutions against marijuana
businesses that operate illegally under
[SPEAKER_00]: state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana advocates in previous interviews
have said that this is the logical
[SPEAKER_00]: progression for marijuana policy as
popular opinion shifts in favor of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, legalization advocates have their
work cut out for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is still illegal under federal
law and considered a more dangerous drug
[SPEAKER_00]: than cocaine and meth under the DEA
scheduling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, banks don't have enough faith
in marijuana businesses to let them open
[SPEAKER_00]: bank accounts, which forces pot shops and
cultivators to run as risky cash only
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that a little bit on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it stands, we're only two steps away
from the federal government stopping
[SPEAKER_00]: rating patients, providers, and
dispensaries for marijuana production and
[SPEAKER_00]: possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe once we get to that point,
the banks will start accepting our funds
[SPEAKER_00]: and the dispensaries will start being
taken seriously like businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only hope, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another article involving the feds
and some of their silliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked all over on this article for
information on who wrote it and there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: author given here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give you credit for your homework
if you don't write your name on your
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does come from the Huffington Post
politics section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually says, feds block water for
state legal marijuana grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feds block water for state legal marijuana
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says, an agency within the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of the Interior announced
Tuesday that state legal marijuana grows
[SPEAKER_00]: are banned from using federal water on
their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a federal agency, Reclamation is
obligated to adhere to federal law and the
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct of its responsibilities to the
American people, said Dan DuBray,
[SPEAKER_00]: public affairs chief for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees
management of federal water resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reclamation will operate its facilities
and administer its water related contracts
[SPEAKER_00]: in a manner that is consistent with the
Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as
[SPEAKER_00]: amended, DuBray went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes locations where state law
has decriminalized or authorized the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reclamation will refer any inconsistent
uses of federal resources of which it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes aware to the Department of Justice
and coordinating with the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reclamation will continue to work with
partner water districts and providers to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure their enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that federal water is banned for
marijuana growing, should a Reclamation
[SPEAKER_00]: employee be aware that Bureau resources
are being used to facilitate the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of cannabis, that employee
will be expected to bring it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: attention of his or her regional director
who will report such use to the Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Justice and document the reporting
actions according to the temporary policy
[SPEAKER_00]: posted on the USBR website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if an employee of the Reclamation
Department finds that you're using water
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow some weed, they're supposed to
report to the Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently 21 states in the District of
Columbia have legalized marijuana for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational marijuana is now legal in
Colorado and Washington State and about a
[SPEAKER_00]: dozen other states are considering
legalization in the coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, the federal government continues to
ban the plant, classifying it as Schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 substance alongside heroin and LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get our way pretty soon here,
we got two more steps and we may see some
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll give us our water back when
Obama tells them to stop raiding all the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal growers and grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a dispensary in Pueblo
West that's suffering right now because
[SPEAKER_00]: their water's been turned off and I called
them and tried to get in touch with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they did not respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's read another article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next article actually comes from
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the Pueblo Chieftain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article was written by Peter Roper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fucking poor name if I ever heard
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the article is headlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo City Council, no to making hash,
no agreement on where pot should be
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making hash oil will be illegal in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one decision City Council didn't
have trouble with Tuesday night as it
[SPEAKER_00]: wrangled over some simple and some
complicated questions about allowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of recreational marijuana in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash oil, by the way, is a potent cannabis
concentrate that is made with butane,
[SPEAKER_00]: a flammable gas that has caused exploding
houses in Colorado Springs and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Council collectively shook their heads no
Tuesday night after Assistant City
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney Carla Sykes explained some of the
hazards of hash oil during the weekly work
[SPEAKER_00]: session.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the tougher question, should city
residents be able to smoke pot on their
[SPEAKER_00]: front porches or in their yards,
did not get resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the city doesn't allow the sale
of recreational pot, Council is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: give city residents guidance on how they
can legally use in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mention that there are
dispensaries like five miles outside of
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city limits in Pueblo West and Pueblo
County and just south of Stem Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're five or 10 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we don't have access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't allow it right inside city
limits, which we have talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we find silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilman Steve Narro... Oh, Councilman
Steve Narroki and Ed Brown, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilwoman Amy Narroki, all spoke up for
letting people use, legally use marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere on their property, just like
smoking cigarettes or drinking beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to trust people to use their
best judgment, Steve Narroki contended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Council President Sandy Daff responded by
underlining her opposition to letting
[SPEAKER_00]: people use pot in their front yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: My community deserves better than this,
she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sykes explained how other Colorado cities
such as Arvada and Boulder restrict the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of recreational pot to backyards and
enclosed yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of offended by the statement that
she said my community deserves better than
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with me sitting on my porch
on a nice summer day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit out there and I play with my damn
phone in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's ridiculous, but I watch
traffic and I cool off and just let my
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts wander for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I put the phone away and just
I'd like to be able to just smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: without anybody bitching at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do it because I don't want to
bring any attention to myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wish I could do it without anybody
just bitching, and I know I'm the white
[SPEAKER_00]: guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be the perfect target for them to come
fuck with, so I just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we deserve better than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted to be able to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted for it to be recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should feel free as adults to smoke
where we feel like we could smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all choked up from the jab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab, hold on for one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Front yards and walks are essentially
public, she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: An amendment 64 does not allow the public
use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver does allow open use in yards,
and Steve Narraki said he wants the city
[SPEAKER_00]: staff to bring forward an ordinance that
starts with the Denver language.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are votes to change it,
they can amend it, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was referring to DAF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilman Chris Kaufman, Councilwoman Eva
Montoya, and Councilman Chris Nichol,
[SPEAKER_00]: who have all challenged recreational pot
in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some decisions about whether to
allow marijuana clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If pot is legal for recreational purposes,
why shouldn't there be clubs allowed where
[SPEAKER_00]: people can use it together?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the general consensus on council
leaned against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major reason was the challenge of
having city police or firefighters respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to incidents at such a club, where they
might have prolonged contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana smoke that could affect their
job performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I laughed through that,
because as I read it, it got fucking silly
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to read through that shit
again without laughing at you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major reason was the challenge of
having city police or firefighters respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to incidents at such a club where they
might have prolonged contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana smoke that could affect their
job performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons they're trying to
stop us from having a recreational smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: lounge here in Pueblo, Colorado is because
they're afraid if the cops or the
[SPEAKER_00]: firefighters have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there, they will have prolonged contact
with marijuana smoke that could affect
[SPEAKER_00]: their job performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's enough news for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to take a dab and grab another
sip of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll come up with the first grow
lesson after that, and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm taking a quick dab, you guys
should check out treethugger.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: www.treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to give you a quick lesson on
germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to read a little post that I
made on Facebook a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's still relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm asked dozens of grow
questions every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give everyone my first piece of
advice to anyone who wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to start growing cannabis on any scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done those on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a simple step-by-step guide,
pick up Let's Grow a Pound by Seymour
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have a nice knowledge base,
take a look at Dr. Robert Cullen Clark's
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Botany or Greg Green's Cannabis
Breeders Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a plethora of knowledge in each of
these books.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read and study before you start a
garden, you will have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of how to build your grow
space, what to plan for during the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: which types of genetics you want to grow,
and a good plan for preventing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems will arise during your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read about the possibilities,
you'll have a better eye for spotting
[SPEAKER_00]: problems before they get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also save a ton of money by not
buying unnecessary equipment or products
[SPEAKER_00]: aimed at new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just me interjecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the grow shop, they put all
kinds of cool shit at the front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like when you go to any store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are impulse buys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shit that you don't really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want you to pick that up and
spend a few extra bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to bust out the grow shops like
that, but that's their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you need something before you
buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's shiny or flashy or has a
new light on it, don't buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So save your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good book will be the best 20 bucks you
could spend on your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will only be useful if you take
your time to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to make notes in your
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should see some of my favorite grow
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're beat to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been through battles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are book markers in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're written on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, that's what grow books are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my best advice for just supply
those people and cover your costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can you do this all discreetly and
safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to buy everything somewhere and
you have to get it all into your house
[SPEAKER_00]: without neighbors seeing your new lights
and your new CO2 setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun sneaking that hydro table into
your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: After your crop is complete, you'll have a
bunch of soil and or sticks to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running hydro, you don't have as
much soil to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're running soil crops or soil
is medium, there's a lot of shit to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's all that stuff going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to put it out with your
trash by the curb?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have enough to think about while
your grows happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little reading and preparation before
you start will make your grow much more
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable and much more relaxing
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart and the plants will
reflect your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow some weed,
my first piece of advice to everybody is
[SPEAKER_00]: get prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what you're getting into
because a lot of people think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start this little closet grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got their seeds going and they're
living week to week with their grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is almost disrespectful and
embarrassing to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to grow good weed like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be a good four weeks ahead of
myself, which sometimes I do get ahead of
[SPEAKER_00]: myself literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when this clone is being cut,
I know when it's going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a good idea of what you're trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the equipment in advance,
have the nutrients in advance because
[SPEAKER_00]: things sneak up on you when you're growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get distracted by life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be kind of secretive about
your grow in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't always do things at the ideal
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to try to get to things a
little sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your crop is at stake here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to love those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't push off the new whatever
you're into, the new Jordans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go buy those today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you take care of your plants
today also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I had to clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many dads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you're drilling out your seeds,
have a good plan of what you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with them in a few days and a few weeks
and all the way through flowering cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't skip any steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think about harvesting and selling
that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even think about that yet because
you've got to think about getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you germinate your seeds,
I totally recommend you have cups or pots
[SPEAKER_00]: for baby plants to live in for about two
weeks to a month or maybe even a finish
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need some soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I actually went and bought some
Light Warrior soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Light Warrior and Happy Frog for my
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need basic nutrients and maybe some
root inoculants in about a week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good piece of advice is to try to
use good seeds if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bag seed is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, chem dog was bag seed,
you know, but it's less reliable and less
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to use seeds from a reliable
breeder if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing what you're growing with will make
your job much easier in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need seeds, check out
naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually in the States,
so you don't have to worry about customs
[SPEAKER_00]: taking your seeds or you getting a yellow
package with green tape across the front
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nature's Green Remedies also uses
priority mail, so your package will arrive
[SPEAKER_00]: in just a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to germinate some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're on the show right now,
I'm going to start three seeds with you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to start ... These are
something I just bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't germinated any of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's seen these before.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually called ... It's
Grateful Daw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quick tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're listing genetics, put the
female first, like ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're crossing strains,
the girl strain goes first, the male
[SPEAKER_00]: strain comes after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies first all the time when you list
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just common practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Blue Dream crossed to the
Grateful Dawg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed the Grateful Dawg, used that
reversed pollen through that onto the Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream, and I've created a strain that I
would like to call Blue Healer if it
[SPEAKER_00]: proves successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to germinate some of these
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have room for a lot of extra
plants right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to see how these go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said you needed a paper towel,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fold the paper towel into a
small square.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fold it one two, three,
four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like a little couple inch by
couple inch here, fucking square and ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and thick, so it's going to hold
a bunch of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to label it Blue Healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just jump the gun here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Healer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to throw that on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to set the seeds inside here so I
don't lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful when you open your seed
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever kind of packaging your seeds came
in, don't lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lose them right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are fucking expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll piss you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like when you open your first
package of shatter and you lose that first
[SPEAKER_00]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fold it up into a little square
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get my water open.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folded it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the paper towel on the plate and just
soak the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might even flip it over and do the other
side a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it's saturated is the word
I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got some seeds on the plate
that I did earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some paper towels folded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're labeled that I did a little bit
ago because I'm starting some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to kind of recreate something that I
did a long time ago and got known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit making it because it was not exciting
to me anymore, but it's time to bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: back anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this plate has too much water on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell that there's standing water on
this plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that there, so I'm actually
going to tip it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on for one second while I run to the
sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love editing.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the paper towel is nice and soggy,
the excess water has gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfold it two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just folded it upright, but I want to
get these seeds down in there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just unfolded it and I'm going to drop
the seeds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got three blue healer seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exciting for me because I get to
see what happens with some shit that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fold it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just fold it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all soaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just put them in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want the paper towel to stay wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's damp and cold to your hand
at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that paper towel dries out,
your seeds will perish and you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping for more seeds soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them damp, but not soggy from here
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set a timer to remind myself to check on
them every four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pour a splash of water on them
whenever the paper towel seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time between watering is going to
depend on your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually traded ... I moved them from
one room to the other today to have them
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting next to me during the podcast and
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I started earlier, they dried up
because I have a swamp cooler right above
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm sitting and it dried them out
quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they were in another room,
they stayed wet for most of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll make a huge difference depending
on where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them often.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to be gone for an extended
amount of time, something that I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do is put the paper towel that
you've got into a Ziploc baggie and seal
[SPEAKER_00]: it to keep the moisture in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do this because I like to let my
seedlings get a little more air,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it helps if you're forgetful,
if you're a pothead like a lot of us are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 24 to 48 hours, hopefully, you've got
some seedlings that have little sprouted
[SPEAKER_00]: tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tail is called the taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important to your plant
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that thing intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with the taproot while you're
handling it, while you're planting your
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That taproot is going to be the source of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucker is going to dig all the way
down to the bottom of your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start spiraling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to make your plant
flourish, hopefully, if you do things
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little tiny seedling that's
sitting in a paper towel after a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you've got to get it into some
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you've got some cups or
whatever kind of pots you're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in and it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your soil, pack it into the container
that you're going to use, the cup or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it lightly packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it in there kind of firm,
but not like hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those roots to be able to grow,
but you also want them to do a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to just be able to
push through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to kind of make your plant
stuff at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're using cups, make sure you
have plenty of drainage holes in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that the pots you're using are
... Don't use clay pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use plastic pots or earth pots or air pots
or root pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something cool like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got these seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got your cup full of dirt or
your container full of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend to water the containers with
pH balanced water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use nutrients at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until a little bit later to use
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your pot filled with soil and water
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see the dirt is going to
kind of cave in because you've left air
[SPEAKER_00]: spots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how dirt works when you water
it the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to go back and sprinkle a
couple more handfuls of dirt in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a larger pot, if it's a cup,
you just need a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go put more handfuls in one cup,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want an ice cream cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the dirt's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you put the seedlings in,
what I do is I just push my finger in up
[SPEAKER_00]: to about the first knuckle into the dirt
or down, I guess, into the dirt to my
[SPEAKER_00]: first knuckle and just make a little
indention with my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just set the seed right inside
there and I don't even bury really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of backfill the dirt real
gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of push it on top of there just
where it's covered up from the light and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a little bit of a challenge to
push through to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows more quickly down than it does
up, so it'll push its way through really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it does, hopefully it's got a nice
rooted bottom to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your little seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 24 to 48, a little while
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they take a little longer, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen seeds take up to four or five
days to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes older seeds need more love or
whatever, but give them time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a little sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You filled your container with dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pressed it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You watered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made an indention with your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dropped your seed in there and you
covered it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, set that sucker under your grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 light works perfect right now,
fluorescent and T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a big 400 watt or 1,000
watt light right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little T5 or some of you guys like the
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll work fine for you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll work fine until you get close to
the bloom phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll stop right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the end of the first grow lesson
that I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick break again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breaks in this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually just easy segues to tell you
the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of spots to take dabs and drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a dab, do a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about what's coming up
in the next show and we're going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to somebody super special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of stuff to learn in that
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you join me next week because
I'll have Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to talk a little bit more about
outdoor growing and I'm going to teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to cut a clone and take care of your
baby clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those clones in the seedlings catch
up, they get about the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will start talking a little bit more
about veg, the vegetative phase and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy veg feeding and we'll talk about a
little bit of training, how to train your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to grow the way you want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about all the basics of veg
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about Nature's Green
Remedies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that coupon code DABLIFE.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get you 15% off any company's
products, not just iReGenetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everybody in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's time when we give thanks to
somebody who has been beneficial or
[SPEAKER_00]: crucial to the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that I have chosen to give
thanks to this week is of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know that you guys have been waiting
for this one, it is Dr. Lester Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys might not know who Lester
Grinspoon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Grinspoon was born June 24th,
1928 in Newton, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He graduated from Tufts University and
Harvard Medical School.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a doctor, Grinspoon was the first
American physician to prescribe lithium
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonate for bipolar disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, here's the good part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Grinspoon became interested in
marijuana in the 1960s when its use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States increased dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had no doubt that it was a very harmful
drug that was unfortunately being used by
[SPEAKER_00]: more foolish young people who would not
listen to or could not believe or
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the warnings about its dangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Grinspoon began studying marijuana in
1967, his intention was to define
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically the nature and degree of
those dangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as he reviewed the existing literature
on the subject, Grinspoon reached the
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusion he and the general public had
been misinformed and misled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally when Grinspoon started out
studying cannabis, he wanted to prove that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was making people crazy and it was all
a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more research Dr. Grinspoon did,
the more he realized that we were being
[SPEAKER_00]: lied to and misled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Grinspoon once said, there was little
empirical evidence to support my beliefs
[SPEAKER_00]: about the dangers of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was convinced cannabis was much
less harmful than he had believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title Marijuana Reconsider reflected
change in that view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grinspoon is widely known as the author or
co-author of several cannabis psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: related books, including Marijuana
Reconsidered, Psychedelic Drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: Reconsidered, Marijuana the Forbidden
Medicine, and Psychedelic Reflections.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two were published during the
1970s when it appeared cannabis was well
[SPEAKER_00]: on its way to nationwide decriminalization
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana the Forbidden Medicine was
published in 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: It describes a variety of ailments for
which cannabis ingestion may be indicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Grinspoon appeared in an episode of
the Showtime series Penn and Teller's
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullshit, the episode which addressed
America's war on drugs aired in the show's
[SPEAKER_00]: second season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grinspoon discussed the way marijuana
helped his young son while he was dying
[SPEAKER_00]: from leukemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely eliminating horrible nausea and
vomiting he experienced after each of his
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy treatments and thereby making
the final year and a half of the boy's
[SPEAKER_00]: life far more comfortable for his son and
for Grinspoon and his wife by not having
[SPEAKER_00]: to endure the pain of witnessing their son
suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grinspoon was also in a documentary called
The Union, The Business of Getting High.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy that was talking about the
pharmaceutical characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana as well as his writing
experience and also getting high with Carl
[SPEAKER_00]: Sagan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Grinspoon even has a strain named
after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's so influential.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's influenced a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that taught us how to grow
learned a lot from Dr. Lester Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we owe a lot to that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Dr. Lester Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an activist, you're an author,
you're a cannabis supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your day, you were brainwashed to think
that this plant was dangerous and you did
[SPEAKER_00]: your own research and you had enough balls
to come out and say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wrong and this plant is actually
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, I have to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Dr. Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just about wraps up this episode
of the I Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys hanging in while
it's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin was really sick this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a couple of other people
joining us in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep it more entertaining than just
me ranting on.

[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you in part by
treethugger.com, live music lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: www.treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a second to say hi to
Nick from Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the comment on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon we should have a DAB lounge
available in this area and I invite you to
[SPEAKER_00]: come down and take some DABs with me when
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you guys want to leave a comment on
iTunes, I'll try to read it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also find the comments in Stitcher and
read those on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comments on Stitcher are harder to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes puts them all in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher has them spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go on whichever episode you comment
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where Stitcher will leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I have to go back and look at each
individual episode to find the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure out a way to beat that
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get smart pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we just leave all the comments
on episode 13?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go comment on 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're going to leave comments,
do them on episode 13 and I'll find them
[SPEAKER_00]: all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easier for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, leave a comment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to leave a comment on
iTunes or Stitcher, you can send me a
[SPEAKER_00]: tweet at iGrowCulture or you can find me
on Facebook at iGrowCulture and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to say something anonymously,
send me a personal message and I will keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your name private.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't put you on blast on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are here hanging out with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back again to talk about some more
outdoor growing to catch up from where we
[SPEAKER_00]: were last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got our buddy Spence from the
Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilling, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilling, chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to have you here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys, both for being back on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it your third time, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence's second time on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kev will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited him, but he was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't been feeling well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, shout out to Kev.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you get well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of Pops for us also.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Jesse's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get right down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time Jesse was here, we talked about
pretty much prepping for outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about security.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about soil prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about caging and pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touched on strain selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our plants in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had them topped several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, by now we should have some happy
little bushes that are adjusted to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we skipped though is hardening
off the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully people... Hopefully nobody did
that already.
[SPEAKER_01]: They figured it out if they were listening
to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they did this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you should have done... What you
should have done... You should have put
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant out for a couple hours one day
and brought it inside and then maybe a few
[SPEAKER_00]: more hours the next day and brought it
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't want to throw that poor bastard
out in the cold and just fucking tell it
[SPEAKER_00]: to live and wish it good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you caught on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully if it's out there already and
it's just stuck, hopefully it's strong and
[SPEAKER_00]: happy and living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty hardy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got a winner if it lives
through the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it lived through the hail that we got
tonight in Pueblo, you've got a good
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a good way to prevent that plant
from getting beat to shit by some hail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Overhead covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mean like maybe a trash can or
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll work if it's smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a whole patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tarp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw a tarp right over them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some kind of framing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some PVC hoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fence to fence or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some tent stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most donors are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a creative bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover those babies though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's stuff that you guys are going to
have to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got it covered, do you want to
put a heater in there later on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to be wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally utilize a system like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can wrap my area in plastic and keep
my plants going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had them in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually a Halloween is your cutoff time
for what most people say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get humidity buildup, so you got to
have a vent and decent heaters,
[SPEAKER_01]: some fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some fans to keep that humidity from not
being stagnant in one spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll create all kinds of problems you
don't normally have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we run any risk with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we did not have that tent thing going
on, the cover, would we run any risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity problems of mold or anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right after rains, but other than that,
southern Colorado at least isn't a high
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado in general isn't high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it rains, do I go outside and shake
the leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the sticks to where it kind of
wiggles all the rain off my leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even set a fan around your plant or
near your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of brush that off a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk into the mic just a little
more?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to turn you up so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to turn yourself down on the
headphones so you don't hear yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the third or fourth time, you'll be
like, all right, you look way better on
[SPEAKER_00]: the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got our plants going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been hardened off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to prevent some mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to notice that when they're
outside, are they going to take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer to switch from the vegetative
phase into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that indoors I see signs in
like 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 14 days on a longer switching
strain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have what I refer to as a
stretch period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a little different period
that you don't have indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going to really be
developing flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, they'll bolt all of a
sudden, kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, wow, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's quite different than
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inside, your plants usually kind of
double in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside, are they going to triple,
do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you get those, you know,
if you didn't top the plant, the thing's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get gigantic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's like a seed plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That huge stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got my plants outside and my
fence is like six or eight feet tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: I better just keep them short before
flower time comes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we got to learn about
trellising and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some outside plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to keep them from getting
too tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about it a little bit last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds are going to get big and floppy
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start taking on,
or not the buds, but the branches are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get big and floppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to use sticks just like I do
inside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stakes, sticks, tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we touched on a tomato,
or yeah, a cage built out of four by four
[SPEAKER_01]: fencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Netting, like the indoor netting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a screen of green kind of idea?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even just throw it over the plant,
stick it to the ground and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pull the branches down into the
different little squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not have thought of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, one bud top per
square, you're going to have beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: little Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't think about trying to
maximize their space and they forget about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a big giant cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want more bud per space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've figured out how to keep them safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to feed while we're
outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were you, a lot of people are going
to just mix up some bottled crap and pour
[SPEAKER_00]: that right outdoors, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend don't do that to our
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can avoid it, you're going outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stick with Jesse's ideas as close as
we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics is easiest outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the plants feeding off the
soil that you build up to supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And help keep the soil healthy,
add teas, molasses-based stoner moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a molasses-based compost tea
with warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different guanos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of tune my guanos to what growth
stage the plants are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peruvian and Mexican guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would probably go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the seabird stuff is really
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of sea products are really
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings out the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jamaican is always high in P&K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for liver flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jamaican's there for the good part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make your compost tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some molasses, you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the warm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use their scrapings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get fed a non-GMO food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some stuff grown on my family farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetable scraps sometimes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I clean their little yard,
all that stuff goes into the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their eggshells too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their feathers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feathers.
The feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the chicken stuff make the soil real
hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicken compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cook it twice as long as just regular
vegetable compost.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of advanced stuff,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry if you're not caught up on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about composting way later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way later in more episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy once you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to just start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we've got you growing, we'll talk you
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned some of the dry fertilizers
that they offer and top feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally use like pure ingredients,
bone meal, blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different guanos again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: All kind of repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish meal is another thing I top feed
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish bone meal actually.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's in flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, various amounts I tend to- So
you're mixing that up in water almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: your tea or are you sprinkling that right
onto the top?
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose you could do it both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I dig it into the top for a little
bit.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just use my fingers and scrape up a
little space to get- Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And drop it right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sometimes they'll do like the Rev talks
about doing spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to recommend his book at the
end of all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read it five times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read True Living Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, doing the spikes where you dig a
little hole next to the plant basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can drop the stuff down there and
fill it back up with dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The theory is, is that I guess the bigger
roots get it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you water that in and then it
kind of becomes part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all natural like the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's, instead of force feeding it,
you're actually letting it eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if that's, you know, if that's
something that you're a little scared of,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you still feel like your plant needs
something extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dry fertilizer packs from like age
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing wrong with using those.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my first choice, but still
better than bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's not anything from Scott's
or Miracle Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything made by Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want really high, high ratios of
nitrogen in your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that long lasting,
slow dispersal shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want natural stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to a hydroponic store, not the hardware
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or mom and pop's garden store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have respect when you go in those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know you're growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't already tell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel the need to go in there and
tell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll kick you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they kick you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and buy stuff for your tomato
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to talk about what
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to talk about what you need
to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask where that is, where this is,
how much is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to go to the hydro shop too often,
especially if you're in a non-legal state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go to the hydro stores in an illegal
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would order online and do discreet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in North Carolina or South
Dakota or Missouri, don't go to the store
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're asking for trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in Colorado I try not to be parked
outside of there too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the law enforcement, but people
are going to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know how people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are happy and fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now we're just in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is the shows today, we're in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just veg and chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to worry about next?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's coming up in the next couple of
weeks?
[SPEAKER_01]: See where we have a really hectic life
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: More likely you're just in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are really starting to take off,
get their feet in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting alfalfa in teas right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alfalfa milk is high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be top dressing in some blood
mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting your cages ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure they're watered and happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to go into flower until
August, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, end of July, August.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little bit to get stuff
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just now getting it outside,
you're all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have some little plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have all my plants out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw your rando outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do it every year?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know how it got there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had walked outside and they were like,
you have a plant growing out back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked around and there was a little
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either, I don't know, a random S1 or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I would guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: She already looks female.
[SPEAKER_03]: She looks good though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I know they're going to start
flowering at the end of July, I think I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to go out there and fuck with her a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top her up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to top and fuck with your plants
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 to 10 days before a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe outside you may be able to go about
seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to see it coming when they
go into that stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: May not understand what I'm talking about
now, but once it happens, you'll know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your last chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much you're done topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and get the super crop in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Spence were just talking about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I learned from Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read from Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish Soma would have came and taught me
that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cropping, you basically find a
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell it's going to grow too high
and just grab it and fucking break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bend it over to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to snap and it's going to scare
you, but if it's a strong hearty plant
[SPEAKER_00]: within six hours, that will start growing
right back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squeeze the area around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bruise, break it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruise the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's strong and healthy, it'll crunch
like good celery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just like good celery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's safe to ... You can just crank
them over too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just slap my plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, I walk through right before a
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're flowering, I walk through and
just brush the whole tops of my indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rub it.
[SPEAKER_03]: With your arm and just going to just smack
a bitch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just smack the whole ... I'm about to go
home and just walk ... Yeah, just like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking six and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence is pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got these 12 feet arm spans,
six feet arm spans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just walk there and smack that bitch all
the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poof, poof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know they're alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know they're awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know they're sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're getting our stakes
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you think you need to come back
and get us caught up with some more shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're just going to grow for a
couple of weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to flower anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be growing for over a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, three, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get in here right before that
stretch phase kicks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone's got any questions,
get them to Mr. Irie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me all your questions or email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all at, let's see, it's at
iGrowCulture on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: iGrowCulture at hotmail.com I think will
work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of ways to get in touch
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read all your stuff on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll answer all your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody's doing it too, I'd like to see
pictures to see people's progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like us to share your pictures,
send them to me on Facebook and I'll share
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Instagram also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tag us in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we find you on Instagram,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Jesse Gros and where do we find you,
Spence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They post some really cool pics,
some great weed pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our bro Spence is from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not from Colorado, he's from North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, he's new to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been here for just over a year,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: About a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like it so far, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably wouldn't go back unless things
are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so, I don't know, it's free.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the words I was going to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've come from somewhere where you get
caught with a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've even seen cops put, find crumbs,
literally crumbs of weed in people's car
[SPEAKER_03]: and take them to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: You come out here and it's so much more
free and then especially the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: are moving here for real reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their children need the medicine so they
have to go to the source and Colorado is
[SPEAKER_03]: right now a source.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the source.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm definitely thankful for all the
rules and stuff that are out here and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just more liberal and free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you pretty decently and I know you
don't do anything stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking cannabis was the only thing that
made you a criminal in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel completely liberated now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just living large now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was always that worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any state you live in, people are going to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're around people that are
smoking in illegal states, it can be
[SPEAKER_03]: sketchy because it's not a safe place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stupid reason to get in trouble,
but you can get in trouble for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still forget sometimes that you're
in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you're rolling, if the cops get
behind you, you got some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like cops anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're still black.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what state you move to,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I definitely feel like I don't
have worries anymore about being high in
[SPEAKER_03]: places and stuff like that because it's
our right to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go home, I know you went to visit
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you catch yourself slipping almost?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I catch myself slipping about
talking because here we can just,
[SPEAKER_03]: all my friends grow pot, all my friends
smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just say random pot stuff out loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you go home, you kind of got to
bite your tongue a little bit and know
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're saying around certain people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of people, they know what
the word weed and pot and dope is,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I don't like why people in the South
think weed is dope, but it's their
[SPEAKER_03]: decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: But definitely I have to bite your tongue
a little bit here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, I bet you freaked people out when
you went home and took dabs with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: People go crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They see the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: They see the torch and they don't know
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get an automatic look like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when you give them a dab and they
get done coughing, it's like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they love it from that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love you forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, their dab is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sleep eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in the fridge and sleep eight
hours and wake up and want to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they did have objection,
you already took off a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you, Jess, now that everything's
all legal, do you catch yourself still ...
[SPEAKER_00]: because you were doing this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe we shouldn't say that,
but you might've been a grower before
[SPEAKER_00]: being a grower was appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get paranoid sometimes still?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you forget?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really like cops, but I'm not
scared of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like challenging them,
but no, I don't really get scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just verbally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best thing is we all have paperwork
and stuff that can disprove a cop.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get caught with some pot and you
have your card and your paperwork,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's nothing he can really do as long
as you're not high in the wrong place,
[SPEAKER_03]: like driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the only place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be high anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend got kicked off the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the Greyhound and they said he
smelled like weed and he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, damn right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, no, you can't be high on
the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to throw a fit, but we don't
know what they can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just discrimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you flip them the bird and
moon them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you still got to walk to wherever
you're trying to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, see, that's, you know, get every
insult in you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to figure out it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy's willing and able.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cool bodied guy, but what if
somebody really sick was just fucked,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from going across the country to
see them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's complete and total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of discrimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always smell like weed, even when I
don't have stuff on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just comes from my work and my hobbies,
but I always smell like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I wouldn't like to smell not
like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is to not smell like
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would really suck if I was
needing to get somewhere and someone
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't like the way I smelled.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, you guys got anything
else to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a good 24 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any cool things to shout out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to shout out Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were taking dabs before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of titanium and we're
like, we should shout out Task on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what up, Task?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an official shout out from the
three of us here, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a machinist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's a machinist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an innovator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you meet him and you hang out
with him at the cup, he's just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: He remembers us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't forget your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the highly educated hoverboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his next mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would write that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a dabric attached to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah, it's tasked.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, check out my friends,
adjessiegroes on Twitter or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he has a Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Spence, Garden of Weedon on
Instagram and Facebook now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook, Tumblr.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a hashtag, Team Weedon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our little crew, so shout out to
everybody in the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's doing the, what's that one called,
Mass Roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody on Mass Roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never check it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted one picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so overwhelmed with social media that
I haven't even messed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot stay on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop sending me games if you follow me on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop sending me games because I don't play
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take those.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have real pot farms if you don't play
pot farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the real shit happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one that isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Candy Crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Candy Crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, everybody wants you to play their
Candy Crush Saga.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife gets death threats over her
invites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what do people learn?
[SPEAKER_03]: Never, they don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there's a new hydro store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello if you're in the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, stop in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheapest price is south of Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, best price is south of Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Pueblo, Colorado on 4th Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on East 4th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between Erie and Fountain, next to ... The
ice cream place right there, ain't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, a taco shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what it's called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tacos ... How about the Hygro Shop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not a sponsor, but we want to give
them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got Denver Pricing in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be a sponsor here in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like people want to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I sponsor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can talk about that off the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want me to say in this
episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brought to you by the Garden of Weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want you to say shout out to my
nigga Spence every time the show is on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't even got to know who I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, name Spence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff says what's up to you every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to say my nigga?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that might offend some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say ninja.
[SPEAKER_03]: To my ninja shout out to my ninja spats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moves quicker, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, I want to thank both my
ninjas for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick around, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back with a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big extra thanks to those guys for
stopping by and doing a podcast with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came here right after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took a moment out of their day to
come and record with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, shout out to Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to follow both of those guys on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this is the part of the show
where we give thanks to somebody who I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe has been crucial to the cannabis
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, we have given thanks to
people such as Mark Emery, Jack Herrer,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny Kush, Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this episode, I want to give a
big cannabis thank you to Keith Stroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Keith Stroup is a Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: public interest attorney who founded
Normall in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stroup obtained his undergraduate degree
in political science from the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Illinois in 1965.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1968, he graduated from Georgetown
Law School in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following two years as staff counsel for
the National Commission on Product Safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Stroup founded Normall and ran the
organization through 1979, during which 11
[SPEAKER_00]: states decriminalized minor marijuana
offenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should take a second and explain to you
what normal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normall stands for the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Stroup was the founder of this
organization, which actually was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: group I ever heard of as an activist group
for cannabis, back in High Times Magazine
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually think I saw Tommy Chong or
somebody really famous wearing a Normall
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really proud to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Keith Stroup is the founder,
one of the guys that got this huge
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, sort of public and political.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stroup has also practiced criminal law,
lobbied on Capitol Hill for family farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: and artists, and for several years served
as executive director for the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
which is the NACDL, which I wish I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have read just that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1992, Stroup was the recipient of the
Richard J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis Drug Peace Award for outstanding
achievement in the field of drug policy
[SPEAKER_00]: reform, presented by the Drug Policy
Foundation in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1994, Stroup resumed his work with
Normall, rejoining the board of directors
[SPEAKER_00]: and serving again as executive director
through 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's currently serving as legal counsel
with Normall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Stroup has appeared on numerous
television shows, such as The O'Reilly
[SPEAKER_00]: Factor, Crossfire, Buchanan & Press,
and Hannity & Combs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually been in the same room with
this guy at a couple of parties and
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was at the High Times Cannabis Cup,
where he received an award.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just such a chill dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He beams with energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems really smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always got people around him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he speaks really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems super intelligent, but he doesn't
talk to the non-suit wearing guys like
[SPEAKER_00]: they aren't just as smart as the guys in
the suits, which I find to be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He paved the way for stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is paving the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still helps Normall fight the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavily involved in the
legalization movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a big, huge shout to Mr.
Keith Stroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for what you've done with
Normall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for what you've done for the
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that this podcast would be
possible without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a portion where I give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give thanks to you guys for
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made it through 14 episodes now.

[SPEAKER_06]: You know it's Bobby Hustle, we're
presenting for essential energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always say OG Kush to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a funny story I wanted to share
with you guys in the news before we get
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the cloning lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this in The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard
about this, but I found it highly
[SPEAKER_00]: entertaining and wanted to talk about it
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, New York Times columnist Maureen
Dowd reported direct from Colorado's
[SPEAKER_00]: bustling marijuana scene again on June
3rd, where as one of the popular
[SPEAKER_00]: columnist's last pieces talked with
nudists, 420 friendly B&B owners in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one takes readers through Dowd's
scary trip on edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this lady bought herself some
edibles here in Colorado and she ate them
[SPEAKER_00]: and she freaked the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article says in Don't Harsh Our
Mellow, Dude, Dowd plans a night inside
[SPEAKER_00]: her hotel room with a marijuana infused
edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got no guidance from the budtender on
dosage and she wasn't familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: state recommended 10 milligram dose
regarding edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: She definitely didn't read our useful
Edibles 101, Eight Tips for Getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: Right Dose Piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's plugging his own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead she asked, What could go wrong
with a bite or two?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then her trip turned into a dark
downward spiral.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, have you ever eaten too many edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a really long time since I've
eaten too many edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was younger, once I ate some
cookies, I actually made them and I threw
[SPEAKER_00]: two ounces of shwagweed in there in a
brownie, a cookie mix for 24 cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I baked it and I made butter out of it
and then I baked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The butter was green and shit,
but I ate some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend ate some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: An uncle ate some of it and a friend ate
some of it and nobody went back for
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cookies fucked us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was high for two days and was supposed
to go to dinner that night with somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went over there to dinner and I just
sat with my head in my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people would talk to me,
I would just look at them like,
[SPEAKER_00]: would you please shut up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause their voices, it was annoying trying
to keep up with them talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt retarded and couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, just quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can't even, nothing they were
saying was making any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I was trapped in time or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they would talk and then by the time
I'd figure out what they said,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were about eight sentences ahead of
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a bad, bad, bad way.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend refused to come to dinner
with me that night cause she was too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ate one of those cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ate one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came home and we found her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, she called me to ask
if she could swallow the lining of her
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth, which I think she meant her mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe her tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what she meant, but she was
super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came home and found her crawling up
the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my uncle, he's a 325 pound guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a couple of those cookies and his
eyes were red, like brick red for two days
[SPEAKER_00]: straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he'd never wanted to be that high
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cookies, I don't know if it was the
schwag weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there was something else
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were wrecked, but it was, it was no fun
to be that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This poor lady's never consumed cannabis
as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is laying in a hotel room having
eaten way too much of a weed edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just flipping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's read a little bit more about what
she says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember her last statement was,
what could go wrong with a bite or two?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then her trip turned into a dark
downward spiral.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I felt a scary shutter go through
my body and brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely made it from the desk to the bed
where I lay curled up in a hallucinatory
[SPEAKER_00]: state for the next eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thirsty, but couldn't move to get
water or even turn off the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was panting and paranoid, sure that when
the room service waiter knocked and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't answer, he'd call the police and
have me arrested for being unable to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle my candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this lady's flipping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's so thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can't reach for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's can't even turn off the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's laying there, panting and paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in a room with a girl who was
this high and God, it was hard to calm her
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just wanted to do all the wrong
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted to go out in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted to call people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, you just got to be
high right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep this high in your little bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck up the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep it contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a struggle to keep those
kinds of folks in the right state of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lady says, I strained to remember
where I was or even what I was wearing,
[SPEAKER_00]: touching my green corduroy jeans and
staring at the exposed brick wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As my paranoia deepened, I became
convinced that I had died and no one was
[SPEAKER_00]: telling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she said she was straining to remember
where she was and what she was wearing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she vividly seems to remember touching
green corduroy jeans and a brick wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, she never would have noticed that
stuff if she hadn't gotten all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was introduced to some new things in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poor lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is paranoid and freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She thought she was convinced that she had
died and nobody was telling her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine sitting there in a hotel room
by herself thinking you're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thinking that you're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to wait for housekeeping
to come find you dead and lay there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That had to be the worst fucking eight
hours of her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, this is hardly the first
newspaper columnist to eat too many
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles and land in a dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least Dow didn't end up in the hospital
after a weird trip like Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post Gazette columnist, Mackenzie
Carpenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might read that article next.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll open that up in another tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happened to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's skim through it and see if it's
worth reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep going on this one though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dad goes on in her piece to reference the
two deaths Denver police are linking to
[SPEAKER_00]: edible marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: A college student who jumped to his death
and the observatory park man who
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinated and allegedly shot and killed
his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to say, why didn't you
talk about those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to give more hype to the
people that they're trying to link these
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to push that story even
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was getting enough press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose to ignore that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you feel left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was my responsibility to keep
my mouth shut on that one, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking to it or about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she addresses issues of edible
packaging, a presentation and potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she asks this Incredibles co-owner,
Bob is paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dow's most pressing observation is the
column in the column was a plea for more
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation and warnings to the casual
user.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reckoned that the fact I was not a
regular marijuana smoker made me more
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerable and that I should have known
better, but it turns out five months in,
[SPEAKER_00]: some kinks need to be ironed out with the
intoxicating open bar at the mile high
[SPEAKER_00]: club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so there's a lot of stuff going on and
people are coming here and doing stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start kind of making the
rules a little tighter for the guys like
[SPEAKER_00]: us that know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to Colorado, please,
if you get an edible that's got a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams, I'm serious, eat a 10th of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new at edibles, you're going to
say, I smoke weed every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't smoke Colorado weed every day
and you don't eat Colorado edibles every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are made for people with
cancer, leukemia, glaucoma, Crohn's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are really trying to medicate
with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't candies to be fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat a 10th of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't feel anything, feel anything,
you can eat more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you end up curled up in the fucking
corner in your hotel room, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, damn, I should have listened to
Ross DeJeff on that podcast and only eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some respect for the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some respect for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some respect for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, I was going to click on that
other article.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm getting a little cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rainy night in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the window open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got shivery here where I'm
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skim this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is Saturday diary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dumb and dumber getting a mile high in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that article just as I suspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some lady came from another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her and a friend split a candy bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mile high candy bar actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't realize such.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was at the pot shop to be novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: She bought a joint to be cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her friend bought an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They split the edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both went to dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her friend fainted because she was so damn
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her friend got all freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up at the hospital and the guy
at the doctor at the hospital said this
[SPEAKER_00]: happens every single day because of
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lady kind of made a big deal about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the basic part of that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got too fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another case of exactly what we are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I'm going to go find a
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a little bit cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what I'm going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab while I'm finding
that hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to come back and
we're going to learn how to cut some
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang in there for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God, I just hit my funny bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they call that thing the fucking
funny bone?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not fucking funny at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fingers are numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little longer than I
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling better now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple episodes ago, we did a crash course
in germinating seeds and getting seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys started seeds, you should have
little sprouts popping up out of the dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything should be growing off to a
good start, looking happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I didn't talk enough about was
the light schedule for your new seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A T5 light is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a 24 hour light cycle when my plants
are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't let them sleep until they get a
little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, T5s are perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halide lamp is perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need anything big like a 400
watt is almost overkill to start your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start them under a thousand,
but it's not necessary at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 lights are perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect for that little fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You people that started seedlings,
you can kick back and let your babies grow
[SPEAKER_00]: while we teach everyone how to take a
clone, but pay attention because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be taking clones from that plant
that grows from that seed here in about
[SPEAKER_00]: two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I feel like if we cut clones
this week and we let them get rooted over
[SPEAKER_00]: the next couple of weeks, we should have
clones and seedlings caught up about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same size and ready for veg here in just a
couple of more episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about taking a clone
from a mother or a donor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mother plant is a plant that's kept in
veg indefinitely so that we can take
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings from it at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep that plant under 24 hours of
light or 18 hours of light, it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: flower if you treat it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you prevent it from getting root bound
and you top it and take clones from it
[SPEAKER_00]: every so often, that plant will stay in
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll always have it available because
it's great to have a reliable,
[SPEAKER_00]: dependable strain around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you hear about all the strains
that are your favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kept around as a mother plant by
someone who has given them out in clone
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bunch of people now have those
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tangy, the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody somewhere discovered the gorilla
glue or even Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody discovered the Girl Scout cookies
and some seeds they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave out a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody gave, they let it grow into a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took a clone of that and gave it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those strains are all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies is available from
California to New York now because of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and cuttings and mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you keep that mother plant in veg,
forever, then this strain will exist
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always go to that mother plant,
cut enough clones off of it to fill up
[SPEAKER_00]: your flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can keep growing more crops
and more crops of Girl Scout cookies or
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla glue or grateful dog or whatever
it is that you've grown from seed or
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten a clone of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep it going forever that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to ask why they
shouldn't grow from seed every time they
[SPEAKER_00]: start a new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason for that is because seeds
do show genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be different phenotypes,
which is something we'll talk about in a
[SPEAKER_00]: later episode, but not all seeds are going
to look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine your brothers and sisters don't
all look the same, but they came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the same seed stock, but you look
just a little bit different than each
[SPEAKER_00]: other because that's the way that genetics
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to have a clone of something
that you've ran and trusted and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: is reliable because medical patients are
limited to a certain amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're running plants that are not
going to be what you need in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of might be wasting space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heavily encourage seed running because I
do like finding those genetic differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've got space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you're comfortable with it,
I definitely encourage you to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get back to talking about mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to find a mother plant is
to get a clone that's been tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know that it's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know that it's dank good
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know that it grows without any
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually if you get it from a shop or a
fellow grower or breeder, your clones are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention that it's your
responsibility to take a new clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: you got from somebody and make sure there
are no bugs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get a clone from somebody and
then blame them for having given you bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get mites or whiteflies from a
clone, that's like not having safe sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't blame it on the person that gave
that shit to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have been taking care of that
shit in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with the clone that comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of ways to treat for
spider mites, for whiteflies, for
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should come up with a good regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's something we'll talk about on
a future episode as a way to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: and prevent bugs on incoming clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to do it is to grow from seed,
but let's get back to clones again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you've got your clone and it's
healthy and bug free, transplant your
[SPEAKER_00]: little clone into a large pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use any smaller than a five
gallon pot for a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it into a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it under 24 hours or 18 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do 18, some do 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep my mothers under 24 hours
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they grow way fast and they
like to give me lots of cuttings and they
[SPEAKER_00]: look really healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that little baby that somebody
gave you, let it get good and rooted,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a five gallon pot, let it grow,
let it get quite a few nodes on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it get growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're gonna wanna take the top
right out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, that's your first cutting that
you're gonna wanna take.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna kinda wanna even out the
height of that plant so that every node
[SPEAKER_00]: starts growing up to be the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Training a mother plant how to grow by
pruning it properly is an art that will
[SPEAKER_00]: take you a few plants of making them look
super ugly before you catch on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I do about once every year,
I re-mom all of my mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take my mother plant and I'll take
six or seven cuttings off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll take the best one of that
and I'll root it or I'll get it in a cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get it grown, I'll get it into a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes my new mother plant for
the next year so that I have a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like they start getting,
they get root bound, they get old,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are only meant to live for a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you try to keep it around for too
long, it will kinda lose its vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I re-clone it and put some youth back
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you could pretty much take a
clone that you're given or bought from a
[SPEAKER_00]: shop and turn it into your very first
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of people don't have access to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna have to run seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking about that genetic
variation from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not guaranteed of what you're
gonna get unless somebody's taking it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the F4 or F5 stage, which that is a whole
nother possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we'll talk about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have access to good
clones, you're gonna need to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and run some seeds to find your
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I usually do is I run a pack of
seeds, usually between 10 and 50 seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the strain and what I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow those seeds out and I pay very
close attention to the veg growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: because veg growth is really important to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need it to be a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pay attention to the way each
phenotype branches out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pay attention to the rate it
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pay attention to how many nodes
and how many little flower cells or not
[SPEAKER_00]: flower sites, but they will be flower
sites, how many of those develop in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little cluster area along the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super careful to feed each plant
and treat each plant the same so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can see what each plant has to offer
without messing it up by doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's nutrients or training or trimming
or topping or whatever, I treat each one
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mix up enough nutrients in one bucket
to feed all of them or in one res to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these little seedlings and I feed
them all the exact same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to rotate them under the light so
that nobody gets like one spot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: light, maybe has better lumens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure they get moved around so that
everybody's kind of treated the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't show any favoritism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're big enough to give me a few
cuttings, I take a cutting or a clone from
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant and I carefully label the
plants and I label the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take, I'm super careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take plant A and clone A and make sure
to label those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your big mother plant is plant
A.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your little clone is clone A and
then you got plant B, clone B all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down to however many you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do them by number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can name them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend who names them after old
ladies for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends that name them after
cartoon characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always seem to name my stuff after
Grateful Dead songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something, something that means
something to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Letters and numbers work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I see what my clones are gonna
root and I'm safe to flower out that
[SPEAKER_00]: original seedling plant, I flower it out
and see what I get from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of people will keep that
original plant around as a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seedling plant that you planted,
a lot of people, I believe so as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stronger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to keep that one around as a
mother and not flower that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll wait for those other clones that
they took to root and then they'll flower
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I save time by blooming out
the original plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already grown and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do a technique called lollipopping
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the bottoms off of the plants where
the light's not gonna penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little bottom branches, I cut those
off because I feel like if the light's not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna penetrate down there, there's no
reason to really have that on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gonna take energy from the tops
where I could build big fat, heady
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've learned how to grow plants with
no larv, no little tiny bud anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my stuff is big and chunky just by
doing a little bit of pruning like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'll take a couple clones from
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those make great clones and
flower that original seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are against that, but that's
just, I have great experience doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already put a couple months into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got clones of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the flowering process,
sometimes I'll even pull out plants early
[SPEAKER_00]: if they show signs of weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen plants that just grow really
wispy, really weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I was throwing away the wrong shit,
but I need stuff that breeds heavily and
[SPEAKER_00]: that grows solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to be playing with those
little weak bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the way we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We practice eugenics in the breeding room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I isolate males or hermaphrodites go
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it shows signs of hermaphrodism,
I throw that sucker away really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about hermaphrodites on
another show, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I isolate the males and if I'm not looking
for a male to breed, I throw the males
[SPEAKER_00]: away as soon as I identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking for a breeding male,
I already had that in mind when I planted
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some seeds down right now that
I'm hoping for a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping for three to five males out of
one of those packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping for three to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting a male is a fun process in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, you guys should throw away your
males if you're new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have the males around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to create pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to put seeds in all your
crop, which is probably not what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, if I throw away a male
or a shitty plant, I also toss all the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and that way you just took,
you made space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just took your numbers down.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention about is,
or I should talk about, you should plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can, plant as many seeds as you
think you're able to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a vegging plant, a clone,
and a flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about whatever you're doing,
that seedling, you're going to need three
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're able to have 15 plants,
plant five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ready to have six, I guess only
plant two.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of guys forget that they're going to
take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need plants and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have plants and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just try to keep in mind how many
plants you're going to end up with because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to, it's going to be like
anything else you fall in love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be like, I need a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to, pretty soon
you're going to be like, I need a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to be like,
I need a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've seen how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the internet too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say plant as many seeds as you
think you can safely and legally handle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but plant one extra because some shit's
going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just plant one extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to think about space
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I like to stress
when we're growing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll let the best looking plants
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you don't like the way something
grows, if a plant is really pissing you
[SPEAKER_00]: off, cut that thing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grow more weed in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to cringe because
maybe you just cut down the greatest plant
[SPEAKER_00]: ever, but as a new grower, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost strains that I miss and you know
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've forgotten all about them until now
that I'm talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually harvest, trim and cure the
plants and smoke all of them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of it, but I smoke a little bit of
each plant myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also take a couple samples of each
phenotype and I give them to friends to
[SPEAKER_00]: help me decide which is best for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medical marijuana provider,
so I have a great team of testers for me
[SPEAKER_00]: that will smoke and take good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given them a little chart to fill out
for me to tell me what they think of each
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and I don't tell them what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just label it A, B, C, D or whatever and
they tell me what they think of each one
[SPEAKER_00]: and then usually I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually know what they're going to want
me to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let those guys smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've narrowed it down to a few of my
favorites, I take them to a lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should take all of them, but honestly
the labs are a little bit expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's two hours away and I think it's
better for me to let the smokers narrow it
[SPEAKER_00]: down because they know more than the
numbers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know more than the machines and
that's who I'm growing it for is the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to just grow for high
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I like the plant that actually
has lower numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys like the flavor or something of
a plant with lower numbers and I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: can usually predict the high testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this plant is going to test high
or this one isn't and I'm usually right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you guys an idea of what some of
the stuff has been testing at,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pull up a PDF I have here on
my Macbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to find it right quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tests were done just a couple of
maybe a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's opening the PDF right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking its sweet time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew, I bred a strain called Lemon
Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually lemon scone crossed a golden
goat and she tested at 24.34 THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a high test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find another one for you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Capel Tan, that's the White Widow
times Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to blow it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real small here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is 20.58% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what we're testing in
the 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the Grateful Dog here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog, she tested at 23.32% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what some things are
coming out at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said at the lab anything over 17% THC
is actually impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we're doing some stuff right
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably give a huge shout out to
the guys over at Steep Hill Halent Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They guided me through getting my stuff
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me a sweet tour of their lab and
their facility and they got the results to
[SPEAKER_00]: me in like three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out Steep Hill Halent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely recommend those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're unable to get your stuff tested,
don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more up to the people that are
smoking it than up to the labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, once you've got your
keeper and you've got a clone of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that should become your new mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grew out a seed pack and you and
all your friends, whoever's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: partaking, participating, smoking,
enjoying, you, your girlfriend,
[SPEAKER_00]: your best friend, whoever, make sure that
you guys all kind of agree on the same one
[SPEAKER_00]: and you keep that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your new mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have that around forever
or until you find something better to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would definitely recommend sticking
with that strain for a couple of runs so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can build a relationship and kind
of learn the plant and see some
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency and see your improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, now you've got your keeper,
you've got a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep that plant around forever so that
you always have clones of it and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: always got that strain to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my mother plants in large pots to
keep them from becoming root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to switch to air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not cloth pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're plastic pots, but they've got
holes in them and they're designed to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt in while they still have holes in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that those will be great for my
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to keep a mother plant
happier for a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them under at least 18 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lights never go off in my mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: My moms are under commercial T5s and they
love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you love on those plants often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love on them once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go take some cuttings off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them the right size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a lot of air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them lively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take cuttings even if you don't need them
because that makes your plant keep growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and stay active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed it a nice healthy veg nutrient
regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not lots of nitrogen, but enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to overfeed the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let any bugs get to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them with neem oil once a week if
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're around other gardens or if
you're around places where people have
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, maybe you need to step up your
treatment game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to find a more integrated
pest management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we will talk about in more episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend who's really good at
such things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll come and help us out with that in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now we understand the mother
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we've got a good understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put some time into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually take some clones from the
mother plant or any plant that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: in the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clone from flowering plants,
but I definitely don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones in those plants have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to kind of revert the whole
plant back to the vegetative state while
[SPEAKER_00]: it roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you're experienced in that
strain of super amazing, I wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just grow some more seeds or get
some more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to grab a drink and I need to
take a fat dab and then I will be right
[SPEAKER_00]: back and we will cut some clones together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I am back and it's time
to cut some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I should say is that the
most important part of cutting clones is
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear rubber gloves while I cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also clean all my tools with rubbing
alcohol before I get started and I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure to have my cloning, my working
and my clone room really clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I use, it's cleaned right
before I cut my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're also going to need a few items.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need a pair of good scissors or
razor blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something that makes a nice clean
cut on the first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go sawing off little
pieces of your plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to whack it one time and be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some good rooting hormone or
cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to need a cup of water
and you should have some pH down to lower
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH of your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes out of your tap is probably
pHed around eight or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get, for cutting clones,
we want to get about 6.0 would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so there are two ways of
cloning that I want to discuss today.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the old Rockwool Cube and Tray and
Dome method and the other is the easy
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner style method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the easy cloner because they are
fast and simple, but they're also kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good easy cloner is going to run you
probably 250 to 300 bucks plus shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus you got to get a couple of nutrients
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the cost of that shipping,
you could probably get the entire setup
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Dome and Rockwool Cube and Tray
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so if you're using the Dome and
Tray method, you'll need a cloning tray,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dome to put over your babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the dome does is it traps humidity in
and gives your clones a happy environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need Rockwool Cubes or something
similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used rapid rooters and I've used root
riots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty much all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this type of cloning, I use dip and
grow for my root hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically just dip it in there and it's
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing the Tray and Dome method,
I also recommend that you use a heat mat
[SPEAKER_00]: and a thermostat to keep the clones warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help increase humidity and also
increase your survival rate for your new
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing the easy cloner method,
all you need is the cloner, some
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, and your neoprene discs to put
the clones into.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the easy cloner, I use clonex for the
gel and I also like to add some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: called clear res and I'm able to take some
pretty big clones of root fairly quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can usually put them into dirt in
seven to 10 days using the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I'll describe using the easy
cloner method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your hands are clean and
hopefully wear some rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your scissors are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your mother plant is healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to water the plant with plain water
the day that I'm going to cut clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just put plain pH balanced water
right through it in the morning and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut clones that night is usually the
way I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I get my cloner all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it filled with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's running.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pHed at 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my easy cloner, I use advanced
nutrients jungle juice, grow, and micro
[SPEAKER_00]: for my easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix my solution in five gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each five gallon bucket, I use 25
milliliters of grow and 15 milliliters of
[SPEAKER_00]: micro, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Each five gallon bucket gets that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill each cloner just below the
sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure not to overfill your cloner with
water because it will shoot the water all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you've got it filled up,
then you adjust the pH to 6.0 and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you have the neoprene discs in there
before you plug it in and turn it on or
[SPEAKER_00]: the water will go spraying all over the
place again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we need a healthy mother plant and
a few healthy shoots to cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lower branches are easier to clone
because they're softer and the fresh roots
[SPEAKER_00]: will grow out of that more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to take the tops of my plants
for a fat clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the top of your plant,
find a node that looks healthy and has a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice set of fan leaves at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that sticks up and looks like
it'll become a nice healthy plant on its
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top, if you've got a new plant that
hasn't ever been cut before, it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: got one fat top sticking off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow that down to an intersection to
where when you cut it, you're gonna leave
[SPEAKER_00]: the little tiny flowers that have just,
or the little leaves that have grown out
[SPEAKER_00]: of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave that behind and maybe it'll grow
into two spots if you cut it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn how to do it after a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a spot that looks like it's
gonna become its own nice happy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut that section off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to give yourself about a six inch
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to clean off most of the extra
leaves on the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only keep the top one or two pair of
leaves from my clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut this piece quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep a cup of water next to me and I
drop my cuttings directly into the cup of
[SPEAKER_00]: water to prevent what's called an embolism
from developing in the fresh cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my scissors in one hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a couple of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snip, snip, I've got two fat looking six
inch cuts with nice leaves at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just drop those into a cup of water and
I gather up cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take however many I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need 10 or 15, I'll just take them
all and have them in that cup and then
[SPEAKER_00]: walk to the easy cloner so that I'm not
cutting clones that sit there and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I take enough cuts and I've
got a cup full and then I start dipping my
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts into, one at a time, into the clone
X.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get a lot of clone X on my
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pour a small amount onto,
I use a plate because it's glass and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I won't, I feel like none absorbs
and I don't waste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pour some out onto a plate and I roll
the bottom inch, inch and a half of my
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting into the gel and I get it good and
covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take the neoprene disc out of
the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to shove the clone into the
neoprene while it's in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's caveman style.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to kill the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that little neoprene disc out of
the cloner, open it up like a Pac-Man and
[SPEAKER_00]: put your disc, put your clone in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And set your clone back into the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you cut it, you store it in
that cup for just a second until you have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut it, you put it in the cup,
you get your cup over to your cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: area, you dip it, you put it inside that
neoprene disc and then you set that
[SPEAKER_00]: neoprene disc right inside of your cloner
and you leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just cut your first clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you repeat that until your cloner is
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dip it and stick it, dip it and stick
it over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have to check my cloners for
like four or five days after I start them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just check to make sure that the water
isn't splashing out out of any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs or the input or output slots where
you plug it in and where the air hose goes
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure the water hasn't evaporated
or gotten too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can mostly set it and forget about
it until the clones are ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking clones of multiple
strains, make sure you figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: mark everything and identify which clones
you've taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll just use a sticky label and
put a name on it and stick that in the row
[SPEAKER_00]: or on the front to identify which row
those clones are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I use a cup and I cut it into
small, like a solo cup and I cut it into
[SPEAKER_00]: strips, like the size of a plant label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I write the name on there and I just
stick that in the little Pac-Man slot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the neoprene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know what I mean when you play with
the neoprene by the Pac-Man slot right in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put it in the mouth there and then
each clone's labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to label your clones if you're
working with more than one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like having a clone that
you're not sure what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow it out and you get to wait till
about day 30 or 40 to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that should get you guys
through the basics of using the EZ Cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I need to take a dab and get a
beverage right quick again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys join me and take a quick
dab and then I'll be back with the lesson
[SPEAKER_00]: on how to use the tray and dome method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang in there, I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, through the magic of editing,
I am back already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tray and dome method that we were
talking about will require a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to keep the humidity high in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to set up your heat mat and
a timer or a thermostat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the clones get too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about 75 degrees is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aim for 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the tray on top of your heat mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used everything from Rockwool cubes
to RapidRooters, to every brand of root
[SPEAKER_00]: cubes there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them work the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get what you like or whatever is available
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool is simple and it's inert,
so that's a good way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the ones that don't have nutrients
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now take whatever you've selected and soak
it in water that's been pHed at 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use Rockwool cubes, so be sure
to soak those things thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to float and they don't absorb
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just float sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I fill a five-gallon bucket with water
and I drop all my cubes in there and I let
[SPEAKER_00]: them soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull them out one at a time and set them
in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna select your cutting the same
way as you did before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll take the cuttings the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to cut a nice angle at the
tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a nice long angle because that area,
that exposed area, is where the root tips
[SPEAKER_00]: will start to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a cup of cuttings with nice angled
cuts on the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: One at a time, dip those into the dip and
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dip and grow, you just have to dip it
right into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to leave it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just dip it into there and then gently
slide your cutting right into that
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not go directly into the bottle of dip
and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour some of the dip and grow out into a
shot glass or something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to contaminate that whole
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of your plants has a problem and
you put it into that dip and grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: now you just infected the whole bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever kind of cloning solution you're
gonna use, that may work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, dipping and grow, I think it's
got a little bit of alcohol in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still we don't want to risk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to bend or break your
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel it snap, you can cut the
broken part off if it's still long enough
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to re-dip it and re-stick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would just take another cutting if
you have it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste space with one you're not
certain is gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get your cutting about a half inch
or more down into the Rockwool cube if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've finished cutting and dipping
and sticking the cuttings, you can put the
[SPEAKER_00]: dome over the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave the vents mostly closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave them just a little tiny bit open
to let some airflow on the sides if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have side vents, but I leave all those top
vents closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave them closed for a day or two and let
that humidity build up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them under a light that's always on
and let them take root.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 lights are perfect for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are good also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to check the humidity and the temp
every few hours and make sure the cubes
[SPEAKER_00]: are moist and never dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those Rockwool cubes or whatever kind
of routers you're using, if those become
[SPEAKER_00]: too dry, the clones will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about two weeks, hopefully you'll have
happy clones that are ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've gone over the basics of
using the dome and tray method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly haven't done that for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've gotten the easy cloners,
I haven't looked back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do it right and I pay attention and
I keep everything clean, I get about a 99
[SPEAKER_00]: to 100% success rate using my easy
cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out with big fat roots and
they're nice and healthy and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I skipped anything or if I said
anything, that you felt was off,
[SPEAKER_00]: please feel free to email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've given the contact
information out quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be clear, it's igroculture at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tweet me at igroculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Facebook at
igroculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for images to post on
Instagram and I found a forum post with
[SPEAKER_00]: tons of information and pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will post a link to that on the Facebook
page and I'll try to tweet it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between that post and my rant,
you should have said sexy clones in about
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that wraps up my grow lesson for
the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys have good looking clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have good happy mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In future episodes, we're going to talk
about the vegetative growth stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about keeping your plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about keeping your plants bug
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover a lot of things on
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys stick around for a lot of
the stuff that I have planned for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now this is a part of the show
where we take a moment to give thanks to
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who I feel has been crucial or
beneficial or instrumental to our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: movement and or industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, we would like to give thanks to
a nice lady named Brownie Mary Jane
[SPEAKER_00]: Rathbun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from papermag.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually wrote an article called 10
Historic Heroes of Marijuana Legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: by Abdullah T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidd Said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I pronounced that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great article.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give thanks to Mary Jane
Rathbun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A major buzzword in state medical
marijuana efforts is compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing the relief that cannabis can bring
to severely ill patients makes the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: restricting them seem cruel and unjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highly publicized story of Brownie
Mary was one of the first to inspire this
[SPEAKER_00]: sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a hospital volunteer, she distributed
weed brownies to AIDS patients on the sly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she got busted for it, the public was
on her side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who can get mad at a sweet old lady giving
brownies to sick people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brownie Mary Jane spent most of her life
dedicated to charity work and was
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental in the passage of
California's fighting the good fight for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we give you a huge thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mary Jane Rathbun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I'm going to wrap this
show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over time a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be closer to 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already getting close to the 45 minute
mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go, I want to remind everybody to
leave some comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the show is over, go to iTunes,
go to the iTunes store, search for I Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Culture, find the review section,
give us a five star rating, type in a
[SPEAKER_00]: comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the show

[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that the show is available on

.com, we have every episode posted from
[SPEAKER_00]: one all the way to whatever we are up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 15 will always be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them all up there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the next episode, we're going to talk a
little bit about some change in some
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican laws and we'll get a little bit
more into Grow Class and we will have
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse back soon for more outdoor grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned, keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in about a week with another
show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until then, take a fat dab, give your mom
a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see
[SPEAKER_09]: you next time.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to take a second and read the
comments that I actually found on
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ta-da.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how I stumbled across
this, but anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her first comment comes from our friend
Mr. Omnio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Mr. Omnio.
[SPEAKER_00]: He follows us on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I find a comment on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, educational and amusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to this weekly podcast as
it's both informative, and then in
[SPEAKER_00]: parentheses, he says, even for the
seasoned pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it's informative, educational,
and I enjoy its relaxed, easygoing style,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether presenter only or with guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pretty much be sure of a laugh along
at some point, some point too,
[SPEAKER_00]: as there's often a laugh or two moments
included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a goofy dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me personally, anybody that
knows me, you know I'm a goofy son of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep myself together and keep it
composed while I do the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes we just got to bust out on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having fun with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for learning with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a seasoned pro, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know more about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what your grow level is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a white belt grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a black belt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll read more of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment comes from Henry710.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, exactly what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast answers the questions I've
been too afraid to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is lucky to have these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for, is to answer the
questions that people in other places
[SPEAKER_00]: can't ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are growing, we're hiding
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only a few states that are,
well, almost half the states are legal
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but that means there's half that you
can't have weed, you can't grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to be on the undercover so you
can listen to this podcast while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working in your garden, while you're
driving to work, while you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can learn some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I'm helping you guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Colorado is lucky to have us,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like it's my duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the world is lucky to have me
feeling like I need to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I feel really blessed and really
lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blessed is the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no luck involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked hard and I was given what I
worked for to be this educated and this
[SPEAKER_00]: good with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I got to return it to you
because I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to give that love back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I send it out to you guys with the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: My return.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment is from our friend
Overgrow the Gov. What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the info show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you rocked it with the info on this
one, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You helped me out with a favor the other
day when put some flyers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the help and the support,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to Overgrow the Gov.
Man, I appreciate the comments you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know people are listening and
appreciating the show and learning
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a little bit of work into this and
it all pays off reading those kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys leave your comments on
Stitcher and iTunes, I will read those in
[SPEAKER_00]: a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to leave a comment on
iTunes or Stitcher, you can tweet me at
[SPEAKER_00]: igrowculture or you can find me on
Facebook and I'll respond to you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to say something anonymously,
send me a personal message and I will keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it private and I'll respond to you and
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a question or something like
that, you can always email me at
[SPEAKER_00]: igrowculture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up in this episode, we're going to
talk about putting those clones we cut
[SPEAKER_00]: last week into some dirt, but first we're
going to read some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a dab real quick and we will
be right back with a few cool news
[SPEAKER_00]: reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the news, I want to do
our first product review on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our good friends at Mary Jane's Glass
Haberdasher in Pueblo, Colorado were kind
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to give me the Clow Pore Clow Tank
M2 to review on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a handy little dab pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking some lemon Jeffrey out
of it for about a week and a half now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't burned out on me yet,
which is actually pretty impressive for
[SPEAKER_00]: most dab pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me the Viking battery to attach
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said any battery of this voltage will
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part is actually the Clow Pore
Tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the Clow Pore body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fits right into the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just screws in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part is the heating element.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that part dies, you can just unscrew
the heating element and replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part is the tank where your
extracts, your concentrates will go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got lemon Jeffrey in here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes delicious out of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your concentrate in, you screw on
the cap, and then it's got this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a dome, but it's just a straight
cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a cylinder dome that fits on top
of that piece over the tank, and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really do like is they claim that
this is all titanium and that the heating
[SPEAKER_00]: element is ceramic, which is really cool
because what I don't like about a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these dab pens is the plasticky taste that
they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure because they do have that feature
where if you hit the button for 15 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: or 10 seconds, whatever, it turns off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned that trick, so you just hold
it down for one second less, let it go,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then start over again so that you can
keep heating that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tasted those dab pens melting while
I'm dabbing them, or while my buddy dabbed
[SPEAKER_00]: it too long, or whichever one of us
overheated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could taste the plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I've been heating the shit out
of it, and I haven't tasted any plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did get clogged up one time,
but it was really easy for me to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had two other vape pens that I've
clogged up, and once they got clogged,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a dry herb attachment
available, but I did not ask for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told her I wouldn't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to smoke herb out of a little
pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems silly to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to fill that thing 25 times
to get the effect I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go and give it four stars or
four leaves out of five because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lasted me two weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays charged and charges quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds enough extract for me to do what
I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't broken it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't taste bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing is it could hit a little
harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if they made these little
holes, larger, or if they gave me a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more heat, I'd get more of a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a certain amount of time of heat
on this thing, and then it cuts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I preheat it, if I hold it
down for half of the time, like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: holding it now, and then I let go,
and then I actually go back and hit it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a way to get a fat hit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it four pot leaves out
of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out again to our
friends, Mary Jane's Glass Haberdasher.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for helping us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hooking us up with the shit
going on in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the world news, Jamaica to
decriminalize personal marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is actually by Horace Helps
from the Chicago Tribune.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool name, Horace Helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jamaican government has decided to
decriminalize the possession of small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of marijuana, joining the trickle
of countries moving to soften laws on the
[SPEAKER_00]: drug known on the Caribbean island as
ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minister of Justice Mark Golding made the
announcement at the afternoon news
[SPEAKER_00]: conference on Thursday, saying that
Jamaica's dangerous drug acts would
[SPEAKER_00]: formally be amended this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like Jamaica is going to let
you have some ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cabinet of Prime Minister Portia
Simpson Miller is at Portia or Portia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tweet me and tell me,
at iGrow Culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cabinet of Prime Minister Portia
Simpson Miller made the decision on June
[SPEAKER_00]: 2nd, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: These relate to possession of small
quantities of ganja for personal use,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoking of ganja in private places,
and the use of ganja for medical medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approval has been given also to a proposal
for the decriminalization of the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja for religious purposes, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay recently became the latest country
to legalize marijuana use, joining several
[SPEAKER_00]: countries in Europe, as well as the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just worded this one funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US states of Colorado and Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they were going to call Colorado
and Washington our own states,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they just worded that oddly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So possession of small quantities of the
drug would become a non-arrestable,
[SPEAKER_00]: ticketable infraction in Jamaica,
resulting in a fine, Golding said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's why they did it, which I think
is kind of great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, Too many of our young people
have ended up with criminal convictions
[SPEAKER_00]: after being caught with a spliff,
something that has affected their ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to do things like get jobs and get visas
to travel overseas, Golding said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He added that the government would propose
a bill in the Jamaican parliament soon
[SPEAKER_00]: that will expunge the criminal records of
people convicted for possession of small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of the drug, which has grown
widely across Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change means that a person cannot be
arrested if he has in his possession up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 57 grams of ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: In public space, anyone ticketed will be
given 30 days to pay the fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: failure of which will result in becoming a
minor offense, resulting in the offender
[SPEAKER_00]: doing court ordered community service.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Golding, possession of ganja
for religious or therapeutic purposes as
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribed by a registered medical
practitioner or for scientific research by
[SPEAKER_00]: an accredited institution will also be
decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it looks like there's nothing in
there that I wanted to argue with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to let you have medicinal
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to let you have religious
marijuana, which is damn cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-arrestable, ticketable offense,
infraction, not even an offense and
[SPEAKER_00]: infraction in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just get a ticket now and they're
doing it for the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to, they keep fucking up
the youth for small things like cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they can't get jobs and they're
screwed forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to help out a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are making progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to legalize the world before
too long here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to New York, the 23rd state to
legalize medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know some of you guys are going
to have some things to say about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is by Josepha Velasquez from the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is set to become the 23rd state
to legalize medical marijuana under an
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement announced by legislative
leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Democratic-led assembly passed the
legislation 113 to 13 early Friday after
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour of debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after midnight, Senate Majority
Leader Dean Skelos, I don't know if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how you say that, but it looks cool,
said the bill would be voted on later in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day when Republican lawmakers had
reviewed the legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skelos of Long Island said he had planned
to vote for the measure and believed there
[SPEAKER_00]: were enough votes to pass the bill in the
upper chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the so-called Compassionate Care
Act would legalize certain forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana for severely ill patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislation does not allow the drug to
be sold in the plant form or smoked,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can be administered through a vapor
or an oil base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, did you guys catch that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I read this previously and I knew
what I was getting myself into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot be sold in plant form or smoked,
but it can be administered through a
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer or an oil base.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just fucked yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pass this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing, New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier in the negotiations, Governor
Andrew Cuomo sought to ban smoking the
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, saying it was wrong for the state to
promote smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, you have to balance the needs
of many of the patients, and the truth is
[SPEAKER_00]: we're coming to a point where less and
less people smoke anyway, said bill
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor Senator Diane Savino, a Staten
Island Democrat, on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana could be prescribed for at least
10 diseases, including epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: AIDS, ALS, and neuropathy, under the
direction of the state's health
[SPEAKER_00]: department.
[SPEAKER_00]: The health commissioner would be able to
add more illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If approved by the legislature,
the bill would allow the program to start
[SPEAKER_00]: in as soon as 18 months and would allow a
governor to terminate it under advice from
[SPEAKER_00]: the health department or law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's approved, it could start in 18
months, but if a governor or the health
[SPEAKER_00]: department or law enforcement decide that
they want to shut it down, they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are fucking up over there in
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical marijuana has the capacity to do a
lot of good for a lot of people who are in
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, who are suffering, and are in
desperate need of treatment that can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide relief, Cuomo said during a news
conference with lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like somebody wrote that shit out
for her really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill does not require insurance
companies to cover the cost of the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients who sell their prescribed
marijuana could face a misdemeanor charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients will be required to carry a
registration card showing they are
[SPEAKER_00]: authorized to possess the drug and can be
prescribed a maximum 30 day supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's going to decide what a 30 day
supply is?
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, you've done fucked up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I read this, stupider you sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, five organizations get four shops
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that like monopolizing already?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the counties where the marijuana is
grown and sold, receiving revenue from an
[SPEAKER_00]: excise tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the stipulation, cultivators must
grow the drug indoors in a secure
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuomo was initially opposed to medical
marijuana earlier in his term,
[SPEAKER_00]: but proposed a pilot program in January to
allow up to 20 hospitals statewide to
[SPEAKER_00]: administer the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: He initially wanted a five year sunset
period to evaluate the new program,
[SPEAKER_00]: but negotiations extended that to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jamaica got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York fucked it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is stupid medical marijuana in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to count them as the
new state for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the new poser state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, if you didn't see six or
seven red flags in that whole article,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to more local news.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did national.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back to the hometown of
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is from the Pueblo Chieftain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for an author.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is written by Chris Woodcutt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is titled Bored Eyes Water for
Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two policies to provide water for growing
marijuana within city limits and in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: County will be considered today by the
Pueblo Board of Water Works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Water Board meets at 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Allen C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hamill Administration Building,
319 West 4th Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two resolutions have been drafted for
consideration by the board, one for
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying treated water within Pueblo city
limits and the other to leasing raw water
[SPEAKER_00]: within Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both types of water sales would be subject
to changes in federal laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resolutions are an attempt to work
with the Bureau of Reclamation's temporary
[SPEAKER_00]: policy, which prohibits using federal
facilities such as Lake Pueblo to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: water to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It excludes water not under federal
contracts that is commingled with contract
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The policy issued in May also requires
like a reclamation to notify the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice if its employees
learn water from a federal facility is
[SPEAKER_00]: being used to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although medical marijuana was approved by
Colorado voters in 2000 and recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana passed in 2012, growing
marijuana remains a federal crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the proposed resolutions,
the Pueblo Water Board would not sell any
[SPEAKER_00]: water with the federal link in the supply
chain to marijuana growers, but it would
[SPEAKER_00]: sell water from its direct flow rights
below Pueblo Dam to the pot industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resolution to the city use water would
revise the Water Board's policy to change
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of water based on federal policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also clarifies that some of the water
rights owned by the Water Board are not
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to federal policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the policy leaves open the
possibility of terminating water use for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana if federal policy changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the second resolution, the Water
Board would make up to 800 acre feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: 260 million gallons of raw water available
to marijuana growers in Pueblo County
[SPEAKER_00]: annually through leases that potentially
could provide up to $500,000 in revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: each year using the current rate of $630
per acre foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also contains a provision to cancel
contracts based on federal policy changes
[SPEAKER_00]: and stipulates that the Water Board is not
required to negotiate or approve any water
[SPEAKER_00]: lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Pueblo has regulations for
medical marijuana and for growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing, and testing recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo County has regulations that allow
medical marijuana as well as growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one part here that got my
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also contains a provision to cancel
contracts based on federal policy changes
[SPEAKER_00]: and stipulates, here's the fucked up part,
that the Water Board is not required to
[SPEAKER_00]: negotiate or approve any water lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one day they decide water is now
$900 per acre foot, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not required to negotiate or
approve any water lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys wonder, people often complain
that marijuana is too expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: that high grade cannabis is too expensive,
that the shops are charging too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reason why shit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They every time, and I'm experienced in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time a dispensary I was part of the
Wild Wild West.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a big part of the very first
dispensary in city limits in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no dispensaries in the city
limits of this town when I had a shop with
[SPEAKER_00]: some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a shop started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped them get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day they got tired of it, handed me
the keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one day the police came in and closed
us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time we would get our shit
together, they'd say, here's your next
[SPEAKER_00]: hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would jump through that hurdle and then
they'd go, oh, these guys can jump high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give them a really high hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put us up another hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually we were playing high jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we got good at high jump,
then they wanted to do more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted us to javelin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensaries went from a few rules to
ridiculous rules, to everything being
[SPEAKER_00]: under camera, to everything being on
lockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every one of those steps costs more
money and more money and more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a lot of what they're
doing it for is for more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the stuff that's making the
price of cannabis stay where it is instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of going down with the mass supply that we
have provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to come up with more money for
water now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another rant that I just went off
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you guys were a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that was enough news for the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to get into a grow lesson
right quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, we took a bunch of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we better learn how to get them into
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys hang out and I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, we talked about
mother plants and cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those clones should be rooted and ready to
go into dirt now or within the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potting clones from the EZ Cloner and the
Rockwheel cubes will be pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to be a little bit more
careful with the clones from the EZ Cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't have anything holding
the roots in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be a little more careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of more delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go too far, I should mention
something noted to me by my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutproof does not use mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutproof uses his vegging plants as his
mother plants and takes cuttings off of
[SPEAKER_00]: them two or three weeks before he flowers
his big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that saves him some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only growing a few strains,
that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool uses that strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of thinking about switching to it
myself to make more room available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of having a mother plant that
you take cuttings from and then you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: those cuttings, you just have this plant
that's been in veg for a few weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just take two or three,
three or four cuttings off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got your new mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've also got your next round
of plants to veg from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you're confident in your
clone cutting, wait a couple of weeks for
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones to root or whatever,
and then throw that plant into the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got your next mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you take healthy cuts,
I don't think there is any genetic loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it happens if you are proper
with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could probably talk a whole other
episode about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to getting our clones into dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your area is clean and try to
wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important because you're
going to have the roots out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are the most gentle part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything they touch, they will absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go setting them on some dirty shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to use good soil for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like happy frog or light warrior for my
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that allows a lot of oxygen into
the root zone is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a small amount of nutrients
when I put these babies into dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure to add some kind of root
inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something with lots of
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Great White or OGT.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get OGT at Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about them earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycos are beneficial fungi that promote
root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll definitely notice a difference in
your plant's performance if you use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use them in one plant and don't use
them in another, you'll be able to tell by
[SPEAKER_00]: the root acceleration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the roots get bigger, they can take
more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes your plants grow bigger,
better, happier, faster, healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely recommend using some Mycos in
your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use a small dose of Veg Nutrients
for my transplants right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix up a five-gallon bucket of water
with my Great White and my Veg Nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: For small plants, I do use bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like organic care for my babies,
so I'll mix up some Nitrex and Great White
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just adjust it to 6.5 with my pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I toss an air stone in the bucket and I
let that water get oxygenated while I
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting my containers ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these small plants, they're just
little babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use solo cups like a beer
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use clear cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want your roots exposed to
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a solo cup and I cut plenty of
drainage holes at the bottom to let excess
[SPEAKER_00]: water escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want water to drip right out,
but you need the bottom of the cup to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once my cups are prepared, I fill them
about halfway with soil or put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tray and water each cup with my nutrient
solution before I put the clone into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically just want to water the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference between the Rockwheel
Cubes and the Easy Cloner is that the Easy
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloner is a little more vulnerable and
needs a little more help for this next
[SPEAKER_00]: step.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Easy Cloner clones, I make a
little mound in my cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should kind of look like a traffic
cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should remind you to wear rubber gloves
for this whole process, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little mound of dirt like a
traffic cone inside my cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to spread the roots apart around
that mound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that really promotes root growth
and balance plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the roots are carefully spread out
and the clone is centered, add more soil
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cup until you have about a half
inch space on top left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then water the clone thoroughly with
the nutrient solution and put it under a
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 light that stays on for a minimum of 18
hours per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my T5 lights very close to my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them as close to the tops as I can
get without exceeding about 70 to 87
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't get above 80 or 85 in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 is kind of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: 85, you're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the clones in Rockwheel, the Rapid
Rooters, they do the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not as concerned about spreading
the roots out because the rapid rooter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rockwheel, hasn't spread out enough
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of holding them intact to
the base of the clone, which is where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're real tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just set that Rockwheel into the wet
soil and fill the cup until there's about
[SPEAKER_00]: a half inch of space left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then water the Rockwheel clones the
same as you do the Easy Cloner clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get those under 18 hours or more of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5s are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, don't get them up real high in
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to stay about 77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't pay enough attention to their
temperatures when they're in veg and that
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't allow you to grow strong,
healthy plants so that when you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, your plants don't live up to their
full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where the humidity dome and
tray and Rockwheel cube method go wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of the new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your clones have been in 70% humidity for
most of their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once those clones get upset about the
lack of humidity, it's hard to bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've been taking off the dome
daily and letting these clones acclimate
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly, they're going to freak out when
you expose them to the drier atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend putting those cupped
clones that came out of the dome back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the dome if you have room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can fit about 12 of those cups
in one of the domes and tray setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't use the dome, you can put a
clear cup on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get another bag of those solo cups and get
clear ones this time and put those on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of your red cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you accidentally bought clear cups
in the first place thinking you were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put clones into those, now you have a
use for them because they aren't any good
[SPEAKER_00]: for rooting your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that one on top and it'll work like a
dome for each individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get rooted into the soil,
they'll be more forgiving to that humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have another life source.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be so dependent on the moisture
in the air to live because they'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get moisture and sustenance from the
roots for survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them more and more time without
the domes each day until they're stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in just a few days, they'll be
well adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once your clones are into cups and fed,
be sure to label your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks having a clone that you don't
know what it is because you got stoned and
[SPEAKER_00]: mislabeled it or forgot to label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to make up a name and that
just creates more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please label your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these clones we just put into cups are
going to need a few days to adjust and dig
[SPEAKER_00]: their roots into the new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be cool in the cups for about
10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go a little longer if you really
need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to leave them in there until
you can take off the cup off the dirt and
[SPEAKER_00]: just see the roots kind of trying to bust
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I want to put them into bigger
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some guys are going to ask why we
don't go to larger pots now and save time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger pots do require more soil,
which means more nutrients, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger pots also take up more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these cups, we can plant plants and
enough dirt to let the roots grow while
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the water use low, which means you
don't have to add a lot of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of saves you some time and
saves you money, saves you dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: saves you space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to feed nutrients to a three
gallon pot full of dirt while I'm only
[SPEAKER_00]: aiming at a cup worth of roots is kind of
what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to be more efficient,
more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once these clones take root and they
show us they're going to survive and
[SPEAKER_00]: survive that transplant process,
we'll begin the vegetative growth phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let them grow in the cups for a
couple of weeks before we repot them into
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing pots or they'll veg for a few
weeks or a month and then they'll begin
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a long journey ahead of us and
I hope we can grow a nice crop together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been going on and on and
on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take a dab and we'll wrap
up the show real quick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said before, if you have any
corrections, questions, concerns,
[SPEAKER_00]: or any kind of input, please contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given a great tip from Cutproof and
I'm glad he chimed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have thought of that if he
didn't say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I try to cram a lot of info into
one episode or into one show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So correct me or ask me to elaborate on
anything you want to hear more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me at iGrowCulture on
Twitter, iGrowCulture at hotmail.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: or of course there's always a Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick dab and I'll be
back to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get Jesse on for the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on July 2nd, I'm going to be
recording the podcast live from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Brickyard in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be closing down the hookah bar
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a private party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see if I can't invite some of
the podcast listeners to come down and
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to figure out what they're going to
allow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may give you guys a password on the next
episode, and then you'll have to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: password or something to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then only the people that know that
are allowed in, but we have to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: private to be able to do the things we
want to do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the portion of the show where I
give thanks to somebody who I feel has
[SPEAKER_00]: been beneficial in the evolution of the
cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hanging out with a friend of mine a
few years ago, several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, this was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an old school grower and an old
school reader from back in the overgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking and he's like,
hey, do you know who Soma is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I don't know who Soma is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, dude, you remind me so much
of Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did wear any responsible pothead
would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got online and I checked out this guy
Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Soma and I have some related
bloodlines somewhere along the line
[SPEAKER_00]: because this dude's got dreadlocks down to
his ass and dresses like an old hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the original Wookie right here is
Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma was born in 1949.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably been growing weed longer
than you've been alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the author of the book Organic
Marijuana Soma Style.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was accidentally became known as the
ganja guru after developing award winning
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's best known for New York City Diesel,
Amnesia Haze, Lavender, and So Gouda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taught me a lot of not personally,
but through his readings and his YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taught me a lot of things about
mimetics and the vibe of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are things that I understood and
believed in anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good to see Soma out there doing
the organics and teaching this vibe for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just how to grow fat buds,
but how to love the plant, how to connect
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of Soma's awards, his strain winning
awards were 1999 Reclining Buddha won the
[SPEAKER_00]: indica category in the high times cannabis
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2001, New York City Diesel won the
sativa cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the high times cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2002, Buddha's sister won the indica
category and New York City Diesel won the
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa category in the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2003, Amnesia Haze won the sativa breeder
category in the 420 IC growers cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The list goes on and on and on and on and
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude's bred, grown, and won many,
many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to say thanks to Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know who Soma is,
check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably smoking some of his
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a G13 Haze from Soma one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blew my freaking mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have done all kinds of crazy shit
for a clone or seeds of that, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: not available at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to live without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank you, Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done a lot for my development as a
grower, as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're doing it for a lot of
people in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma is in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't come to the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, he hasn't been here in
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you hear the show somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big love, Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pretty much wraps up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out on Instagram at
iReadGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also follow the show on Instagram at
iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Twitter for both of those as
