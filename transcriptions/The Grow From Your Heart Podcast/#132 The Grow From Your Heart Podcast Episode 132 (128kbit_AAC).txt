[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, shout out to my friends in the
Mystic Roots band for letting me use their
[SPEAKER_02]: music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, Mystic Roots is on tour this
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're touring around with Catchafaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing five or six shows in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be at the Colorado Spring Show at
the Black Sheep for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a good chance I'll be at some of
the Denver shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot commit to any of that right now,
but I will definitely be at the show at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Black Sheep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look forward to seeing the Mystic Roots
band there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody stay positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get down.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, hope you guys are having a
great week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am having a wonderful week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hot as shit here today in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is the hottest day of the year that
we've had so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hit 80 degrees in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was over 80 degrees today in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first day I got sweaty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first day it actually got a
little bit hot in the large grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I thought, hold the shit, it's warm in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to start making those summer
adjustments in your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start thinking about air conditioning and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, maybe we need to do an episode
on doing the season switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's do some important
announcements.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, the Secret Sesh is coming back
to Denver on May 19th.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Secret Sesh brought to you by Gatsby
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want more information on the Secret
Sesh in Denver, Colorado on May 19th,
[SPEAKER_02]: all you have to do is follow at Secret
Sesh Colorado on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Secret Sesh CO on the
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I cannot get you tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot get you passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get you on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot do anything to help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am simply blessed to be at the event
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the people that asked me for help,
all the people that sent me text messages,
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you right now, I can't do shit
to get you into that event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do what you gotta do, get on the list,
make your reservations, pay your dues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take some fat dabs with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby for throwing
this event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, a huge shout out to Adam Ill for
coming from California to host this event
[SPEAKER_02]: for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love, much respect to Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without Adam Ill, this podcast may not
have happened, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Ill kind of inspired me to do a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He quit doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt an absence.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple other podcasts that
inspired, but Adam Ill had a huge part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big respect, much love to Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I'm gonna turn down
this music here, and we're gonna talk a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about, let's see, I've been
growing in cocoa lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made the switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran a few pots at the Big Grow with
nothing but cocoa in there, and I am
[SPEAKER_02]: really liking it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like I'm watering a little bit
more frequently, but one thing I've
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed is that I cannot overwater the
plants that are in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing a couple of experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one pot set aside from all the
other pots, and when I water, I give this
[SPEAKER_02]: one pot double or triple what every other
plant gets, and it does not ever show
[SPEAKER_02]: signs of stress from being overwatered,
so that's something I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some times when I know I'm not
gonna get back to the grow first thing in
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning, so I will just heavily,
heavily water those plants, and I felt
[SPEAKER_02]: like when I was running soil, sometimes I
would flood those plants so much that I
[SPEAKER_02]: could see them getting droopy and being
angry from being overwatered.
[SPEAKER_02]: That never happens with the cocoa,
so I'm able to flood these plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't get pissed off from being
overwatered, but it does feel like on my
[SPEAKER_02]: regular watering schedule, I need to hit
them a little bit more frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had to increase the amount of water
that I give them, because they are drying
[SPEAKER_02]: out a little bit more quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I've noticed with cocoa,
one thing I should mention with cocoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are no nutrients in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just using straight cocoa,
there's nothing there to keep your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: going, so you're going to need to feed it
nutrients almost every watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been giving it lots of nutrients,
and I water the plants twice a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do nutrients, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's two waters in one day, nutrients,
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day, I'll go nutrients,
nutrients, and then I'll go nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the watering before I leave on
the third day, I usually just hit them
[SPEAKER_02]: with clean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any over nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look mad from being
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really liking the cocoa, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I should mention, don't let your
cocoa dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you see the top layer of cocoa drying
out, that's when you're in danger of your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants getting a little bit too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens very quickly on cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: The timeframe, when you walk into a soil
grow and you see your plants drooping,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're starting to get pissed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're drooping in cocoa, they're
fucking angry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing some experiments,
and I'm learning so that you guys don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to kill plants to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got more access.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got more space, so we're learning
with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This kind of segues into something else I
want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overwatering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of people and a lot of grows
overwatering their plants, and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering why the growth of their plant is
stunted.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something that happens when the
soil starts to dry out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: or when your medium starts to dry out a
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moisture to oxygen ratio in there
really makes your roots want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really makes your roots want to eat,
so they start searching for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start growing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This really makes your plants get active.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have noticed that when I used to run
clones in root cubes or rockwool,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would notice that my clones would
actually root the best when I would forget
[SPEAKER_02]: about them, and the rockwool cube would
dry up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that that dryness is what
the plants are looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more than the wetness.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to be soggy all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a good idea to give your
plants a short dry-out period.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want them getting wilty and
crispy, but keep an eye on your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water your plants thoroughly, and then
keep an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see right when they start to droop
a little bit, that's when you need to give
[SPEAKER_02]: them water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start learning right before that happens,
and then start feeding them right before
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right before they start to droop,
that's when you should be giving them
[SPEAKER_02]: water every time so that you allow that
dry-out phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that happens in that dry-out
phase that we've talked about on this
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast, several episodes back,
as the moisture level in your root zone
[SPEAKER_02]: changes, as the water level in your soil
ball and your cocoa area, as that moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: level changes, so will the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're feeding your plants a nutrient
solution that's real high in pH,
[SPEAKER_02]: you pour it in there, only certain
nutrients are going to be available at
[SPEAKER_02]: that pH level.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the moisture level and temperature
change inside of that soil ball,
[SPEAKER_02]: inside that rhizosphere, inside your pot
in your container there, the pH will
[SPEAKER_02]: change and different nutrients will become
bioavailable to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several advantages to letting
your plants dry out just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want you to let them get crispy,
but it is good for your plants to dry out
[SPEAKER_02]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see much more production.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I like to put my mother plants
in root pots or air pots or earth pots,
[SPEAKER_02]: any type of fabric pot that they can
breathe a whole bunch, or they make those
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic pots that have a bunch of holes in
them that have the dimple shapes on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that because I feel like
you're getting a lot of oxygen,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then if you're using that and cocoa,
your roots are going to be surrounded by
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen and they're going to grow rapidly
and your plants will love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my take on cocoa and kind of a
segue into letting your plants dry out a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to use more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely need more cow and more mag
with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: More cow mag, heavily with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you're using soil or cocoa or a
soil, this makes it a good idea to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: let your plants dry up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a quick talk, quick ramble about
how I feel about cocoa and what I've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned about letting the plants dry a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move into the next part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, yesterday I spent a couple of
hours working with a male plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been following my social media,
you know that I've got an Arise male from
[SPEAKER_02]: Arise F1 seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a male plant that looks like a true
stud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I plan on using him as my breeding stud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took him to about eight weeks of flower
in a flowering room to see what he would
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday I cut him down, but before I
did, I collected the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is how I collected the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several methods to doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually used a couple of different
techniques to see what I liked better just
[SPEAKER_02]: because I wanted to talk about it on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I started, you guys, I was holding
a mason jar and I was just going to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom buds and I grabbed a drumstick
because I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grabbed a drumstick and I was just
tapping the male buds over the jar and
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen was falling into the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was working, but I felt that a bunch of
the pollen was missing the jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was tapping the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollen was falling down the side of the
jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollen was falling on my hand,
the side of the bud that didn't have a jar
[SPEAKER_02]: near it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just pollen falling onto the
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was plenty of pollen collected,
but I felt like I was wasting a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this jar and I'm just tapping buds
and I'm tapping the buds, the pollen into
[SPEAKER_02]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next method that I tried was I cut the
buds off of the plant and I just laid the
[SPEAKER_02]: male flowers, the buds with the male
flowers, onto a glass tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was just tapping them with my
finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was noticing was a bunch more
pollen was falling off and landing
[SPEAKER_02]: directly onto the tray and I wasn't losing
as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem there was I was gathering
a whole bunch of male flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I had to do was sift out the male
flowers from the pollen because you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to leave those male flowers in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you store it with those male flowers in
there, there is a chance that those male
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers have moisture in them and they
will mildew up inside of your jar and
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture is one of your biggest enemies to
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about that here in
just a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I found to be the most successful was
I just chopped the top right off the male
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and I set it on a glass tray and
just tapped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just tapped it for a couple of good
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was tapping it kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I could just see the pollen falling
out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I turned it over and did it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I picked it up and tapped it with my
finger to knock off any pollen that stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I just threw that big old pollen ...
What did I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pollen removed a bud, just threw that
part right into the trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt that setting it on the tray and
tapping it was my best method for
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I did get all those male plants,
so I just used ... It felt kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: sketchy, but I just used an old ID on a
plate and just separated the male flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: from the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of felt like a cross between when
you used to pick seeds out of shwagweed
[SPEAKER_02]: and also when you used to use a credit
card to do bad drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a weird feeling, but it was
definitely ... It worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a mason jar with a nice two-inch
layer of a rise pollen in the bottom of it
[SPEAKER_02]: and I do plan on making some crosses with
the rise and I also plan on making a rise
[SPEAKER_02]: F2 in the future here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look out for some seeds coming up from
iRegenetics in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll need some testers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need you guys to run those for me and
tell me what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a bunch of messages from
people that want to be testers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could deal with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very selective on testers,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes time to test seeds,
you need to have an impressive resume if
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to be a tester for me because I
need to know what's truly going on with
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need reliable testers.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the time comes, I will talk about
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not time for testers yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, another method that I was using
to try to collect the pollen that I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: find to be very successful was I was
cutting the branch off that had the male
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers on it and just cutting it into six
or eight inch sections and actually kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of dipping that into a mason jar and then
tapping it at the base of the stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was working, but I was not able to
knock off enough pollen to make it worth
[SPEAKER_02]: my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also knocking off a bunch of male
flowers into the mason jar, which meant
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had to pour that back out onto the
plate anyway to sift it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't find it to be effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best method was to put ... If
you've got a giant mirror, or if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: drummer and you've got an old kick drum
head, just drop a nug, the male plant
[SPEAKER_02]: right down onto the giant mirror and just
tap on it and then all the pollen will
[SPEAKER_02]: fall off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then use a credit card or an old ID just
to scrape it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've got your pollen, you're going
to need to store your pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend putting it in a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I like to put that mason jar in a
brown paper bag to keep it dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I put all of that inside of the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carefully label your jars of pollen,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: My jar says, a RISE F1 pollen collected
5516.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's easy enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that that's a RISE pollen and I
know when it was collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never really tried to store pollen
for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always use it kind of soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could imagine it would last a few months
maybe, but I'm honestly not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's properly stored six months,
maybe a year, I don't want to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got information on how long ...
If you've had pollen stored for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time and you used it and it worked,
send me an email,
[SPEAKER_02]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear your pollen methods on how
long and how you apply pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know how long you keep it before
you apply it and what the oldest viable
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen you ever had was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've collected a bunch of pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got it in a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been stored in the fridge for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something I must mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not get your pollen wet in any way,
shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moisture is pollen's worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people ask me, they're like,
bro, you breed and you grow seedless
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers in the same facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you scared?
[SPEAKER_02]: Having that male flower around or that
male plant around that's just spitting
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you worried about seeding up all of
your females?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes shit happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I have grown crops that were
meant to be seedless and I've accidentally
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered a whole bunch of seeds in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because it had a male plant in the
same area and it just got cross
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The secret is water deactivates pollen,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got two separate areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: One's got a male plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: One's got female plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The female plants are in flower and
completely able to accept pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still in their ovulation phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can accept pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can become seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to grow long enough to make
viable seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that I prevent them from being
seeded when I mess with my male plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday, I was playing with a male plant
about 30 feet away from those female
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did was I took my backpack sprayer
that I would apply pesticides or foliar
[SPEAKER_02]: feed in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mixed up some water in there,
just straight clean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pHed it at 6.5 and I sprayed that all
over my female plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I went and I played with my male
plant in a separate area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I collected all the pollen from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw away all the trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw away the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw away, not the pot, but the
container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw away the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw away all the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I swept up that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cleaned up the room where the male was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I took the clothes that I was wearing
and I walked straight to a washing
[SPEAKER_02]: machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the clothes off and threw them into
a washing machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I walked myself directly to a shower
and I hosed myself down, including you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am 6'5 and I have got dreadlocks almost
to my knees.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dreadlocks are mid thigh region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to run to a shower and just rinse my
whole self down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go wash the dreads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go wash the beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went and scrubbed myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that the water I applied to those
female plants made them unable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit of birth control.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made them unable to collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pollen was not allowed to land on the
pistol and move into the ovule because the
[SPEAKER_02]: water was in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also feel that any water or any pollen
that was on myself or my clothes was
[SPEAKER_02]: destroyed as soon as it hit the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I carried those clothes up to the washing
machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw them in the washing machine,
turned on the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the hat that I was wearing got thrown
into that washing machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the clothes got washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hat got washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the dreadlocks got washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then before I went back into the grow room
with the females, I went and grabbed my
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayer again and I sprayed it in front of
me as I walked into that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was water landing on those plants
before I got into there is what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: aiming for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that these plants will not
be seeded, the female plants that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: messing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday after I played with my male
plant, I went and took pictures of the
[SPEAKER_02]: girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am 99% sure that I did not seed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about water, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen people set up a screen,
like a screen door so you open up your
[SPEAKER_02]: grow room door and then there's a screen
door and they've got water running down
[SPEAKER_02]: that screen door.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little mister spring water right
at the top and it collects on the screen
[SPEAKER_02]: and runs down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is their pollen catch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also sell a UV light that will kill
pollen that goes in your ducting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If pollen comes in, it goes through this
UV light that goes through your ducting
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it is just killed right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neutralized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollen isn't as scary as a lot of people
like to think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water will destroy pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are afraid of pollinating your
plants, just apply a little bit of water
[SPEAKER_02]: and you should be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are playing with pollen and
female plants and male plants in a small
[SPEAKER_02]: area in a house in a home grow,
the first couple of times, expect to get
[SPEAKER_02]: some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes one little tiny speck of pollen
to make a seed and pollen is so tiny you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't get it all off of you unless you
kind of have some experience and know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't be surprised if you pollinate
your crop on accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have been going for 17 minutes
now and you can hear the dryness in my
[SPEAKER_02]: throat so I'm gonna take a quick drink and
a couple of dabs and I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I am back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm well hydrated and well medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to give a huge shout out to my
friends at Terpex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the whole Terpex crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I am dabbing some cactus
cookies cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's shatter made by the friends at Terpex
and this stuff tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, props to the grower, whoever grew
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not me, I'm not bragging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever did the growing here, they did a
really nice job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great work, great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always pick up your Terpex
shatter, your Terpex live resin,
[SPEAKER_02]: your Terpex waxes, your Terpex butters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get your Terpex products at
Green and Healthy Wellness at 430 West
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado and Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a medical only facility so you do
need your medical marijuana recommendation
[SPEAKER_02]: to shop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, many of you may know that I am
a consultant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I help people build grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I help them get their grow rooms going.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a problem in your grow,
you can contact me, pay me a small fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will come to your garden and check out
your grow and tell you what's going on and
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you what's wrong and help you correct
and improve your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So recently, I was called to a place where
this guy had powdery mildew and he could
[SPEAKER_02]: not figure out what was causing the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem was that he was not getting
rid of his old stale air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to remove the stagnant air from
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get rid of that extra
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get rid of that old moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get it out of the room and get
some fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy is failing to do that in his area
and he is getting powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried a few things to get rid of the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've applied a couple of products that
seem to be working but unfortunately he
[SPEAKER_02]: had to harvest a little bit early because
the PM was overtaking a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me tell you a little bit about what
we tried to get rid of this powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: A while back when I first discovered the
powdery mildew in this guy's garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: I started applying a product called stylet
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's JMS stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed to be working very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was knocking the PM off of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't see any on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't come back for quite some time,
but we had to keep spraying it about once
[SPEAKER_02]: a week to keep the PM away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really didn't want to spray this
stuff on heavy chunks of funky buds
[SPEAKER_02]: because I could tell it was leaving a
little bit of an oil on the plants which
[SPEAKER_02]: was actually the main ingredient that was
stopping the PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't want to put this oil all
over his buds so I didn't like spraying
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I researched another product and I was
recommended big time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time exterminator is 90 or is mostly
citric acid or citric oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember which one it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's citric acid and it works very
well at keeping insects away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes the plants look really good and
it also took the powdery mildew off of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, this product only works to
keep the powdery mildew at bay for about
[SPEAKER_02]: three to five days at a time before we
would start seeing little speckles pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was getting closer to harvest and I
wanted to try something a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were ready to go extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not want to use Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am trying to only use products that are
allowed by the MED in my personal grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: in my caregiver grows and in my consultant
grows just because it's easier to have one
[SPEAKER_02]: playing field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will not use Eagle 20 in this
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did use was I got 30% hydrogen
peroxide and I filled up a four gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: pump sprayer and I put 20 milliliters per
gallon of 30% hydrogen peroxide in this
[SPEAKER_02]: water and I adjusted the pH and I soaked
all of the plants with this hydrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: peroxide solution and it took off most of
the powdery mildew and it did not come
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there was one plant in the
back corner where the powdery mildew had
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of taken over and I didn't see it was
so bad back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't spray enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not take off the powdery mildew on
one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend harvested most of his plants
didn't show signs of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one plant that did have powdery
mildew, I found a solution online.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Jorge Cervantes taught us about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a five gallon bucket and I put 50
milliliters of the 30% hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_02]: in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, let me back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever you were messing with this
hydrogen peroxide, be sure to wear rubber
[SPEAKER_02]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need some latex gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to get this stuff on your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll burn your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on what kind of skin you've got,
it could mess up your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a white guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dribbled some on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made my fingers look bleached white.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine if you don't have working hands,
if you've got some softer, more gentle
[SPEAKER_02]: hands, it probably could burn your skin
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you wear gloves when you're
using the hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mix your 50 milliliters of hydrogen
peroxide into a five gallon bucket of
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys, this may sound crazy,
but I chopped the buds off of this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was dunking them directly into the
water and swishing them around for about
[SPEAKER_02]: five to seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just swishing it under the water with the
peroxide in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would cut off most of the leaf,
you guys, most of the larger leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd give it a little pre-trim and then I
would dunk the bud into the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was hanging it on a line with a
fan, an oscillating fan blowing near it
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly to dry these buds out as
quickly, not dry them, but to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: water out of them as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left the fan on there for two to three
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then toward the end of the day,
I just turned the fan to where it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing directly on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave all the buds a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot tell the difference between the
buds that I dunked in the solution and the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds that were not dunked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best part is the buds I dunked shows
zero signs of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this is something you want
to try at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not something I would do in my
garden, but I saw it work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I smoke this product,
it's not ready to smoke yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be ready in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am 90% sure that I'm not going to notice
any of the peroxide solution in these
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may sound completely crazy,
but if you've got a plant that's got to be
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested and it's got a little bit of
powdery mildew on it, the best solution is
[SPEAKER_02]: to get a five gallon bucket, some water,
and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_02]: and go ahead and dunk those buds in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave them in there for five or six
seconds, pull them out, hang them up,
[SPEAKER_02]: put a fan on them, and try to start
getting them dry safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once they get dried out from that
water you just put in there, you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: drying them just like normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would dry and cure them just like any
other flowers that you've cut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that helps save your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important part, you guys,
if you're getting powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to correct the issue in your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something is causing that powdery mildew
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are not getting enough airflow in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend heavily defoliating
your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take off all the extra leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will prevent PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be less surface area for the PM
to build up on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got two leaves that are on top
of each other, one leaf lays on top of
[SPEAKER_02]: another, and you get that little water
layer underneath there, that will
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually turn into powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants are sweating on top of each
other, and that sweaty space is the
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect environment to create some PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also another thing that we are
experimenting with, I need to get with my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend that's got this product,
but he recently bought the Clean Light.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the Clean Light is, it is a UV light
that is designed for the strawberry
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and the pumpkin industry,
because strawberries and pumpkins
[SPEAKER_02]: apparently get powdery mildew very
heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they take this light and they hold it
three to four inches above the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they just move this ultraviolet light
around, and this light supposedly kills
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend just got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's only used it a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it takes about a week of constant
use, of consistent use to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_02]: PM, but I will check with him in a few
days, and we will see if this has cured
[SPEAKER_02]: his powdery mildew problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, since I'm talking about PM,
I have a theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like CBD-rich plants seem to be
more susceptible to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's something in the THC that
gives it resistance to PM, and I do plan
[SPEAKER_02]: on talking to Fox a little bit more about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next time I have Fox on,
that will definitely be one of my topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fox, we got to get you on the show
soon, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the guys from the Colorado podcast,
this is the second time I told you we got
[SPEAKER_02]: to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get Jesse and his crew back in
here to do another outdoor grow lesson for
