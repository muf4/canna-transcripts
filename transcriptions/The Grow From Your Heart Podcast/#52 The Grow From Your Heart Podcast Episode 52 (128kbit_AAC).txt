[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 52 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower or a professional
grower, if you're a new smoker or a
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis
activist, or if you're just curious about
[SPEAKER_00]: the current state of cannabis,
this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a huge thanks to the Mystic
Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for letting me play your
music on the show, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: The song is DJ Anna Dance, the
instrumental version.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intro I usually play is called the
Doggie Dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to switch it up, you know,
bring some spice to your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Kat and Coot from the
Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming to you on, today was our good
friend Jesse's birthday, and it was also
[SPEAKER_00]: cousin Tater's birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got home from Jesse and Tater's
birthday party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that was a fun party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an alcohol drinker, so I left
when the alcohol kind of got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy, but we retreated back to the Garden
of Weedon, and Spence, and Matty,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Michael, and Big Mike, and myself,
and Joe hung out and took some dabs after
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, big shout out to Jesse and Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep calling you Tater, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your name's Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, cousin Tater and Uncle Jesse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for bringing me to your party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, huge, huge shout out to Matty and
Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a little dinner at their house
before the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to a bowling alley and tried to
bowl, but it was too damn crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone just ended up in the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before that, we went to Spence and
Matty's and had some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a vegetarian, and I will not eat
anything with animals or animal products
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can eat what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't judge you, but I don't eat
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were nice enough to make me several.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an entree for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made a portobello, a big portobello
mushroom, and I put it on a bun,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I called it a portobello mushroom
burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a couple of slices of avocado,
some Swiss cheese, put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: onion on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made some potatoes that were
delicious and some pasta salad that was
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big, huge shout out to those guys for
catering to my picky ass and taking care
[SPEAKER_00]: of me and my picky diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Spence and Matty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me at the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you guys every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yesterday was Bob Marley's birthday,
since we're doing birthday shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dreadlocks and I'm a rasta,
so you know I love me some Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other reggae,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone always tells me, when they see my
dreadlocks, their first thing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people say is, I love Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there's more reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to some other reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out some Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out some Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're into it, it's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out some Bounty Killer and some
Capelton and see where I was inspired to
[SPEAKER_00]: name my strains from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honored two of my favorite reggae
artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kalanji is after Sisla Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out Sisla, Bounty Killer,
and Capelton also and see where I decided
[SPEAKER_00]: to name some of my strains that I've bred
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing an episode by myself,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just gonna be rambling for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some news articles and this will
be the episode where I am going to
[SPEAKER_00]: announce the winners from episode number
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm probably gonna do that towards the
end of the show just to keep you listening
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how you build suspense and
keep people listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you entered the contest on Facebook
and or Instagram, this could be the show
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're gonna get excited and win
some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep listening and I'll tell you the
winners in a minute here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get that far, I have to do this
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is brought to you on your
entire order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pay what I pay when you
shop at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice little discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every penny helps with the way the economy
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can save a little bit of money on
your grow, that's definitely gonna help
[SPEAKER_00]: you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell them that you listen to the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, new to Hygro Indoor Growing
Supplies, they are now carrying Rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Worm Company Worm Castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, if you've messed with worm castings
before, the minute you pick up this bag of
[SPEAKER_00]: worm castings, you will know that this is
a high quality bag of castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody paid me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a bag of it myself and it smells
rich like worm casting should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the proper color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a little bit of tea out of it and
that tea foamed up really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are gonna think I'm gross
because I think the worm tea smells good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it smelled the way it was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, quality worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the mic bump right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so check out Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Jay and the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are scheduled, Jay and one of his
partners, whose first name I do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know his Instagram name, but I don't
know his real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay from Rocky Mountain Worm Company and
one of his partners are scheduled to be
[SPEAKER_00]: here on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to be here Tuesday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we said six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check my scheduling, but they will be
here to record a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next episode should be Jay from Rocky
Mountain Worm Company and we're gonna talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about worms and environmentally
sustainable cannabis and organics and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see what Jay brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna let them talk and tell us what
they wanna say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up after that, I think will be an
episode with Jesse talking about we wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: give a lesson on light deprivation so that
you guys can get your outdoor crops going
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to plan more outdoor
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just letting you guys know we got a
lot of cool shit coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not slacking off like I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get more on top of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do it week by week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm trying to be a week or two ahead
of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels better and I feel like I'm
bringing you a better show, which I wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: keep doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to somebody told me that they went
back and listened to a bunch of old
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes and I felt embarrassed,
but then they told me, don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: embarrassed because I'm kicking ass now
and they got to see the progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that said that, you know who you
are.

[SPEAKER_00]: So where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna take a minute and read a couple of
the Facebook and Stitcher comments that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to save them on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm searching through the phone right
now to find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, my iPhone has been slow lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a comment that was left on our
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Grow From Your Heart iTunes page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comment was from a person who calls
himself StickyWiki.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave us five stars and he says,
good listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently found the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have followed iRegenetics on IG,
which is Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I followed iRegenetics on Instagram for a
while now and I'm really enjoying some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these episodes and take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: StickyWiki gave us five stars and loves
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for following iRegenetics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to have you on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go comment on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will follow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me who you are and I'll follow you
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next comment was from a guy named
Buzzer with a bunch of Z's.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, sweet show, five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his comment was, thanks for making
this for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for commenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for showing me that you appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're growing better cannabis than
you were before and I hope you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: better understanding of the cannabis
plant, the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned some stuff and thanks a
lot, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Robert Lee commented,
Robert Lee, I know who you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for finally listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to get you to listen to
the podcast for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem to be reluctant to hear me on the
show, but thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: His comment was left on Stitcher and he
said, I really enjoyed this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he left that comment on episode 51,
our CBD episode, which featured Angela and
[SPEAKER_00]: my good buddy Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys listen to that, you understand
why I'm going to give a huge huge shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Angela for letting me post that
entire show without editing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really cool of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of what she said there was kind of
personal and could have been embarrassing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she's a bad ass chick.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a bad ass woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: She deserves more respect than being
called a chick.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a bad ass woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she let me post the entire
conversation without a single edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the Stitcher and iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I had a little bit of a brain fart
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys leaving
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows me that you are listening to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hate the show, you can leave a
comment because I haven't gotten a shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: comment yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do people just not do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just not, you probably skipped it
and don't even want to listen if you hated
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even go leave a shitty review,
but it makes me feel good that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: liking it and giving me lots of good
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please leave me a review you guys,
because what that does is it boosts me up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the iTunes and in the Stitcher
rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more people see the show and then
the more people see the show, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the more people grow better
cannabis and the more people have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: education about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can dispel a lot of the stupid
myths and rumors, and then we can legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our, I think that's our goal for
now is to legalize it and grow the best we
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are our two main objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to assign ourselves main
goals, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the best cannabis we can and legalize
this shit everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really rambly today, which is good
because I'm by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time to get into some news
articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first article has nothing to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it loosely has something to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that is personal to me and
I found it very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remaining members of the Grateful
Dead, along with Trey from Phish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you guys are going blah,
blah, blah right now, but just give me 10
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a concert in Chicago on the third,
fourth and fifth of July at Soldier Field
[SPEAKER_00]: in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is celebrating 50 years of the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Mickey Hart, Bill Krutzman,
Phil Lesh, Bob Ware, Trey Anastasio,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Chiminti, and Bruce Hornsby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that was hard to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing three shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all Grateful Dead music.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from JamBase.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you're like us, you were
wondering just how many mail orders were
[SPEAKER_00]: received for Fair the Well, which will
bring together Grateful Dead members,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Ware, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart,
and Bill Krutzman, along with Trey
[SPEAKER_00]: Anastasio, Jeff Chiminti, and Bruce
Hornsby for three nights of shows in
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicago over the fourth of July weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is almost unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a note on the event's website,
it mentions that 60,000 plus envelopes
[SPEAKER_00]: were received so far by the company that's
handling their mail order fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tickets only went on sale through
mail order, which is only the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's up are going to be able to
order the mail order.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't like a publicly known thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to kind of be on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got 60,000 requests just from the
mail order.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a huge event,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Chicago on the third,
fourth, or fifth of July, make sure you go
[SPEAKER_00]: check out Soldier Field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't want to go to the
concert, go see what it's like to be on a
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dead lot, the parking lot scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go see that hippie scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see that community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to see the Grateful Dead
because I was only 15 when Jerry died,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, 15 or 16, but I did see plenty of
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, fish kind of took over for
the Grateful Dead, so the dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: fish, all of that stuff kind of means
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys go see that lot,
go see that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know, Rasta Jeff could be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not committed to anything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check that shit out, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of why I am who I am and a
lot of what made me who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, the strain ChemDog was
discovered in a bag of weed that was
[SPEAKER_00]: bought on a Grateful Dead parking lot at a
Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where ChemDog came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there weren't these silly hippies
traveling around being deadheads,
[SPEAKER_00]: ChemDog would not exist, and a lot of the
strains that we work with now would not
[SPEAKER_00]: exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my lineup would not exist because
a lot of my stuff is crossed with ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a picture of this African
student, and they're trying to blame a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of this on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, an African student in Wyoming,
Levi, I'm just gonna say Levi-Tamba,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm not sure how to pronounce
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Levi-Tamba died after eating an entire
marijuana-infused cookie and jumping off a
[SPEAKER_00]: hotel balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have also been several cases of
children mistaking pot for candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means some changes for edibles,
including placing marijuana-infused candy
[SPEAKER_00]: and baked goods in childproof packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each individual square of chocolate must
be marked according to how potent it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, back in the day when you
would buy... I can't even pick a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't want to single out a
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day when you would buy a large
edible of a candy bar, it would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of your normal candy bar that you buy
at the gas station or at the grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: store, wherever you get your candy bar,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would buy that one candy bar,
and it would just look... It would be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapper that was plainly marked,
this is a ganja candy bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once you open it, you can't tell
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now every single piece, they have made
a mold that you pour your chocolate into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not you, but the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pour their chocolate into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it divides it for you into little
squares, and they're showing a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole candy bar is 100 milligrams,
but now they've divided it into 10 little
[SPEAKER_00]: squares, and they're all labeled 10
milligrams THC for each little square.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's a little better because
sometimes when you buy edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't remember what you bought,
or you don't remember which is which,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sometimes it's hard to tell if this is
a third or if this is a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now these guys have really made it nice
and easy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep reading the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, at the Incredibles Edibles shop,
they mark each square of chocolate with
[SPEAKER_00]: the number 10 to indicate 10 milligrams of
THC, the psychoactive ingredient of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 is the standard serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, chocolate didn't have to
indicate the amount of THC in each bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were in line with what
industry feels will improve... I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: start that sentence again, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are in line with what the
industry feels will improve safety out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others seem like overkill, but we were
happy to do it, said Incredible spokesman,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Ischino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some clerks working at retail pot shops
have been recommending much more,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could cause some issues with those
who had not had much experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, edible packaging contains warnings to
eat only a small amount and then wait
[SPEAKER_00]: before eating more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, wait 45 minutes, so when you
eat this, wait 45... This is a weirdly
[SPEAKER_00]: worded article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, wait 45 minutes, so when you
eat this, wait 45 minutes to see how it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects you, and then you can continue
with another dose if you really wanted to,
[SPEAKER_00]: says Sweet Leaf spokeswoman, Elizabeth D,
that's a long last name, Elizabeth D,
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't butcher that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're showing a picture of the
package, and it totally shows like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, it says to educate and to
medicate, and there's like a little clock
[SPEAKER_00]: on there, like the one that you'd see at
the store that says, be back in 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead it shows, it says, take one
square, wait two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to encourage you to take
one and wait two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is a lot of people don't,
dude, they think they're badasses and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can just eat it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back into the article, a variety of
the marijuana infused products,
[SPEAKER_00]: including drinks, cookies, and candies,
come in single servings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wanna educate people that five
milligrams is a good serving, not too
[SPEAKER_00]: much, not over the top, make it safe,
said Elizabeth, I can't read her last
[SPEAKER_00]: name, I'm sorry, it's long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first step in regulation for
the edibles industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good idea, you guys,
but something I wanted to bring up,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to crush a couple of
companies, I'm sure, because this came up
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and it had to happen, I think it
went into effect on the first of this
[SPEAKER_00]: month, and they didn't get a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had to pull product that they have
already made, already have packaged,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had to pull it all off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had to repackage it,
or I don't know if they were even allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to repackage it because if the pieces
weren't properly labeled, they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy those candy bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm certain that this put at least one
or two small businesses out of business
[SPEAKER_00]: because of these new regulations they keep
pushing on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of agree with the whole situation
because, well, I work at the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hang out with people that work there
all day and we insist to people just take
[SPEAKER_00]: this and they laugh like they're going to
be able, like they're Superman,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't realize what they're buying
is proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to buying brownies that their
cousin made or that their stoner uncle
[SPEAKER_00]: made and they weren't that potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're buying these medical edibles
and they're just getting, or they're rec
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, but I mean, they're made by the
same people that make medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're buying these quality edibles and
they're just getting fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of like the idea that we're
marking them each piece, but it's hard for
[SPEAKER_00]: a business to keep itself going when every
month there's a new regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, you guys put all those
stripes on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to put the stripes plus a
hologram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to crush somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into another news article
because that one is boring as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up to The Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: They read a lot of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is by David Magoya.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a writer for the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, Oregon's M Bank pulls
out of Colorado a week after taking on pot
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are going to say what,
but I'll catch you up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the Oregon community bank that a
week ago openly welcomed Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana industry customers has changed
its mind, publicly saying it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the infrastructure to handle the
overwhelming response for service.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people familiar with the move say the
retreat was pressed by federal banking
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators who stepped in late last week
to tell M Bank executives that crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: several states to work with an industry
that remains illegal under federal law was
[SPEAKER_00]: simply too risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following national press, the volume of
inquiries in Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Colorado has been so overwhelming that
we don't currently have the infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: to adequately support all of these
customers, M Bank CEO Jeff Baker said
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is the furthest from our market
area and the most difficult to provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality customer service to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are nearly 2,200 pot retail
manufacturing and grow businesses in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, according to the state licensing
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bank will continue to serve legal
marijuana businesses in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Baker said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry Insider said, the pullback was
not unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've become accustomed to our banking
solutions not actually working out,
[SPEAKER_00]: said Michael Elliott, executive director
of the marijuana industry group.
[SPEAKER_00]: After they got all that press,
I was wondering if they'd get increased
[SPEAKER_00]: scrutiny and pressure as a result,
just like all the other banks have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the issue, Baker said,
was M Bank's lack of a Colorado branch,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would require approval from the
state banking authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not need approval to accept
deposits from Colorado businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just searching for loopholes to
not want to do business with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it says, without branch cash
deposits, millions of dollars that often
[SPEAKER_00]: must be treated with cleaners such as
Febreze to remove the pungent marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: smell would have to be made at a federal
reserve bank, such as one located in
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, deposits would be
electronically credited to M Bank's
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts, then to its marijuana business
depositors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Founded in 1995, the $165 million bank has
three Oregon locations in and around
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It nearly closed in 2009 following a
string of problems that ranged from
[SPEAKER_00]: inadequate board management to a balance
sheet
[SPEAKER_00]: weighed down by toxic and poorly
performing loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard to say, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a dab here after this
article, trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Baker said the five
Colorado-based marijuana business accounts
[SPEAKER_00]: that were open will most likely be closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100% on that, but we're reviewing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 60 inquiries from Colorado pot
shop owners will be shelved, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: When M Bank went public with its desire to
bank the marijuana sector last week,
[SPEAKER_00]: its brazenness raised industry eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banking regulators such as the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which oversees M Bank, have frowned on
institutions that are overt about working
[SPEAKER_00]: with legal cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's legal pot businesses have long
lamented that their accounts are closed as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as, okay, as soon as where they are
banking becomes public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly the reason why the
marijuana industry cannot say who they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bank account with and why the banks
don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker sidestepped the question about
whether the FDIC, the agency he said
[SPEAKER_00]: offered its tactic approval to the idea
only a week ago that pushed M Bank out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control, out of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are regulated by the government,
and the expectation is that we run our
[SPEAKER_00]: bank in a safe and sound manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the event we don't, we face severe
repercussions from our regulators,
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, regulators influence our
decisions, but it ultimately is our call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were definitely coerced into it by
the FDIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want, the feds don't want
cannabis money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want us to be able to bank,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others familiar with the outcome of the
FDIC frowned at the public nature of M
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank 's move, making it unclear whether
the plan would have met approval had it
[SPEAKER_00]: not been so well publicized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulators have the gun and all the
bullets, said one banking insider who's
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with the FDIC and its methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of us who have survived the financial
crisis knows exactly how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not team players, our life
becomes miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado has had several efforts at
banking, at banking the marijuana industry
[SPEAKER_00]: go awry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most recent, a long delay in the
opening of the fourth corner credit union.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world's first credit union created
specifically for the pot industry had
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to open at the new year,
but it has not yet been granted a master
[SPEAKER_00]: account by the Federal Reserve Bank in
Kansas City.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're already two months,
almost three months behind in getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: open because the feds don't want us to put
our money in the banks so that we can have
[SPEAKER_00]: it on us when they rate us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they can take it all from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll keep reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: A move last year by the Colorado
legislature set the stage for a banking
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperative similar to a credit union,
but has made no progress despite numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it too would require the
same master account necessary to access
[SPEAKER_00]: the nation's money system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs State Bank, the last
Colorado bank to openly work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana industry closed about 300
accounts in late 2011 that made concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: of working with companies that violate
federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker said he'll likely revisit the
Colorado plan, but it might take some
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The position of state and federal
regulators is that they do not object to
[SPEAKER_00]: banking services being provided to the
cannabis industry, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they absolutely expect the
development of strong programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time and experience will allow programs to
become stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like they want to work
with us at all to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dispensaries are making a lot of
money and without having a bank,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see how difficult it can be because
other businesses don't want to be paid in
[SPEAKER_00]: cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever businesses are attached to your
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a security guard all day
long, so you have to pay for security
[SPEAKER_00]: service.
[SPEAKER_00]: The security service does not want to be
paid in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the dispensary customers paid in
cash, so now the dispensary is sitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: a shit ton of cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to turn that into some sort of
currency that they can pay the
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity, they got to pay payroll,
they've got to pay the accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to pay the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to pay the employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to pay the master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to buy nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pain in the ass to deal with this
because I'm going to press pause for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink and a dab and
I'll be right back with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me get a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting all dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple more news articles and then
we're going to get to the part that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give away some prizes,
some prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bear with me through a couple more
articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm building up suspense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another article in a minute
that's going to come from my hometown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to click over and see how long
we've been going at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 minutes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more articles and I'll give away
the prizes and I'll get out of here and
[SPEAKER_00]: let you guys get back onto your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is from Ricardo Baca from The
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it says $573 million in pot
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are 12 stats that define the year in
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple episodes ago, Spence and Matty
came on and we talked about the year in
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in episode 50, we talked about live
resin being one of the big dicks of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabis went and put together their
12 stats of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read most of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably won't read all 12 of them
because I want to get to the prizes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one says, number one,
130.3 metric tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Colorado's annual demand for
marijuana equal to 36.8 million eighths of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, Colorado sells and or smokes
36.8 million eighths.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of eighths.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying them at a shop,
that's averaging you about $65 to $70 an
[SPEAKER_00]: eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of freaking money we're
bringing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, makes you wonder how many
Coloradoans use regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that is 485,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the number of adults who are 21 and
older using marijuana regularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they account for at least once a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 9% of the state's population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, and what about those using
more often than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 23%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the amount of Colorado's user
population that consumes cannabis nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in my club, 23% of us,
we're in the 23 club, we smoke cannabis on
[SPEAKER_00]: a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the out-of-state tourists
visiting Colorado that purchase legal
[SPEAKER_00]: weed?
90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the amount of recreational pot
sales out-of-state tourists are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for at shops in Mountain City.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my neighborhood, in our area,
what we have observed, I'm going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: about 70% of the people that stop into the
spot dispensary are from out-of-state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say 50% of the people are
from Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what we have observed being in
the place a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one says, but how much of
Colorado's annual demand are these
[SPEAKER_00]: tourists actually buying?
[SPEAKER_00]: 7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the amount of Colorado's annual pot
demand purchased by out-of-state tourists.
[SPEAKER_00]: 9% is the price drop on a recreational 8th
of marijuana at a dozen prominent Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: shops since the 1st of January.
[SPEAKER_00]: An 8th has gone from $53.88 to $48.95 is
how much the prices have dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip over a couple of these
because they're just ridiculous numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a million?
[SPEAKER_00]: $246,810,599.03 is the state's total
recreational marijuana sales as counted
[SPEAKER_00]: from January to October because November
and December data was not available at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time of this article from the Colorado
Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: $246 million, you guys, that's nine
digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your hundreds, you got your
thousands, your 100,000, your 10,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: your 100,000, then you got these other
three digits over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two commas in that set of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of damn money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you're going to ask,
what about total medical sales?
[SPEAKER_00]: $326,716,273.59.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys fathom that much?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nine digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Colorado's total medical marijuana
sales also from January to October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody do some math on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $572 million, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: $572 million we made on cannabis,
legal cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, that's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine where that was going before we had
legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a lot of it is coming from
out-of-state people and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but imagine where that money was going
before we had legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was that going?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was happening with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next number is 103,918.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the number of medical marijuana
patients reporting severe pain as their
[SPEAKER_00]: condition for a license, or 94% of the
state's total patients are using severe
[SPEAKER_00]: pain as their condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which yeah, how can you deny severe pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the doctor and you say,
it hurts, he's going to go, I believe you,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's a doctor and he's
compassionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hell yeah, use that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a spot and say it hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: $60.1 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the amount Colorado has brought in
via taxes, licenses, and fees on
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational and medical, I'm not going to
say marijuana, recreational and medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from January to October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So $60.1 million has been brought into the
state of Colorado just from taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses, and fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was sold and no product passed
hands that way, simply licensing and
[SPEAKER_00]: taxing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: $60.1 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what about the cannabis infused
edibles, the cookies and gummies and
[SPEAKER_00]: brownies that proved to be surprisingly
popular in this first year of recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: sales?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the answer is 10 milligrams of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the state's standard single serving
size for marijuana edibles with 100
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams maximum allowed in an
individually packaged product being sold
[SPEAKER_00]: recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 milligram incredible bar is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing, you don't need more than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from out of state and you're
coming here and you're going to buy 100
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram edible, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't eat that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that that is a decent amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 milligrams is a good limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can buy multiple of those because
you're allowed up to, if you're out of
[SPEAKER_00]: state, you're allowed up to seven grams of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're allowed to divide that into
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many milligrams are in that candy
bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a neat fact that says,
and did any of these edibles end up making
[SPEAKER_00]: for a crazy Halloween as some thought they
would?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the response is zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the number of reports of THC laced
candy given to trick or treaters on
[SPEAKER_00]: Halloween, regardless of widespread
concern that legal marijuana would lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: pot laced candies in children's Halloween
halls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nobody got ganja edibles because
they're expensive and because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: bought it, you probably ate it yourself
and didn't want to give it to some kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are 12 interesting facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistics, I guess they are from the
state of Colorado for the first year of
[SPEAKER_00]: legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got one more article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from, part of this happened in
my hometown in the lovely, lovely town of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I have said stop shipping
cannabis because this dude got caught and
[SPEAKER_00]: he is going to get fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'll probably get fucked after
that, but I'm not going to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says police found $63,000 in
marijuana and pot products in a UPS
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the headline is Pueblo police
Texas man arrested after trying to ship 63
[SPEAKER_00]: K of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of a table with,
it looks like this dude has a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: eights and they're rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know those are probably ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I'm trying to zoom in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got ounces and they're wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those ounces are all shoved into
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like he's got one,
two, three, four of those ounces per bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's got one, two, three,
four, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like eight of them on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever I just push made the thing
refresh, but yeah, he's got several pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another picture of a
bunch of edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a monkey bar on there,
which was one of my favorite edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of a bunch of really
popular edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some Mahatma concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like this dude was trying to
send the goods back to Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's read about what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those articles by Jesse Paul from the
Denver post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the Texas man was arrested
Wednesday on suspicion of trying to send
[SPEAKER_00]: himself an estimated $63,000 in marijuana
and marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of which was legally purchased from
Pueblo back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious because they say $63,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Texas price or was that the price
at the dispensary when he bought it or is
[SPEAKER_00]: that street price or is that DEA markup
price?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I say this guy's name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read his name in the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to because that makes him
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to get credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Wolf was arrested by the San Angelo
Police Department in Texas at his
[SPEAKER_00]: residence and is being held at the Tom
Green County jail in lieu of $100,000 cash
[SPEAKER_00]: only bond, Pueblo police said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wolf has been charged with possession of
marijuana with intent to distribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where the article gets interesting
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police in Pueblo began investigating
Wolf early last month after United Parcel
[SPEAKER_00]: Service employees reported receiving a
package that was suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package was sent by Wolf out of Pueblo
to himself at an address in San Angelo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what makes a package
suspicious because they show a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy and this dude's got long hair and
he looks like he'd be a rowdy Texas
[SPEAKER_00]: troublemaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just called you out, but you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you got that long hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dreadlocks too, but I know what it's
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you look like fucking trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that was all it took to make
him suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and the fact that he sent the package
to himself in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'm Justin Wolf and I want to
send this to Justin Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might have been it, but I'll keep
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says inside police found several double
vacuum sealed packages with the total of
[SPEAKER_00]: nine pounds of high grade marijuana,
police said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigators say the package also had
cannabis, edibles, cough syrup,
[SPEAKER_00]: skin patches and wax concentrate that had
been legally purchased from two separate
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police estimate the marijuana to be worth
$58,000 and the cannabis products worth to
[SPEAKER_00]: be $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo police say they drafted a warrant
on Tuesday for Wolf's arrest and contacted
[SPEAKER_00]: police in Texas who arrested him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually read this article somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that they already have a team in
Texas that works on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way they just called their bros,
you know, hey, we got another one guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just went and picked him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point, the reason I'm reading this
article, stop fucking shipping things out
[SPEAKER_00]: of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are fucking it up for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want some weed, come get it and
enjoy it while you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want weed while you're at home in
Texas or North Carolina or Alabama or
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Arkansas, do what you got to do to
make cannabis legal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come here and mail yourself some
shit to your state and fuck it up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're fucking it up for yourself
because you're going to go to jail and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're thwarting your legalization efforts
in your own place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have spent that energy,
that time and that money legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my rant on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send shit in the mail, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is going to go to prison and he's
got long hair and he's a skinny white
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will not do well in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the same build.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ship some shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit bitching at you about shipping
shit because most of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to the show aren't the people that
are going to ship some stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll quit bitching at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it is time to get to the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long the show has been
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 37 minutes in and I haven't given
out any prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.

[SPEAKER_00]: I feel guilty already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feel bad that you didn't win.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to pick winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had so many prizes and I had a lot
of entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody that entered the
contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody that listened to
the podcast.

show and it pushed us up to 888 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher ranks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 25,000 shows on Stitcher and
this little show that happens here in my
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen at my dining room table has placed
888 out of 25,000 shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not me that did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you guys because I don't listen to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just produce it and record it and talk
into a mic.

[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there was an extra prize package
that I did not list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look over there one more time
because I realized that there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: prize pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to peek across the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four bags over there,
you guys, and I only gave away three of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant that I had an extra bag and
that extra bag has Heavy 16 Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's I read genetic stickers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Heavy 16 stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's random shit from Hygro under
growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to give that bag to El
Rocho.
[SPEAKER_00]: He entered his comment on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So El Rocho, bro, I need your contact
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you won the prize that I forgot to
list because you commented on the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since there's another one,
bro, you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So message me and I'll get that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking really fast, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is almost over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to pause for the last dab because I
needed a drink so badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourselves a dab, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the email going, so I'm already
ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dab some Sativa Mix that I
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Garden of Weedon and
Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and Big Mike helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michael, those guys have got me making
pretty good hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a dab, wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, two, one, let's dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have been bigger than I wanted to
take on the podcast, but we'll be all
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to tell one quick story
before I wrap it up because I just hit my
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman rig and it made me think of
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, I straight dropped and broke a
$300 Hitman Phase 2 cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hit the table and it just fucking
broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know everyone's going, oh my God,
really, you broke a $300 rig?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like a real dumbass about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of had like a moment of guilt in my
heart for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sat at the table and I was like,
you just dropped one of your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: rigs, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's broken glass on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be mad for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be broken hearted, but then you
got to grab the broom and the dustpan and
[SPEAKER_00]: sweep up the fucking broken glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to throw that glass in the trash
and you got to move on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I could do because it's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't glue it back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duct tape is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a moment of zen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was sweeping up this broken glass,
I thought, there's so many things that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in your life that suck and they
hurt, or maybe they're good, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: cling to things because you could drop
that glass at any minute and that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: could break, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't put it back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you just got to sweep some
shit up, throw it in the trash can and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking walk away and just move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have some shit happen to you,
just try to learn something and think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it like that because I've been stuck
on something and breaking that rig was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely symbolic in some way to me and
I learned something from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke a rig and I learned a huge life
lesson from it that had nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the rig itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This moment of zen came over me and taught
me a huge life lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned something from it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's something that you're fucking
stuck on that you're clinging to,
[SPEAKER_00]: just let it go, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's easier said than done,
but I dropped a $300 rig and I swept it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and threw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing we can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to sweep some shit up
and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get cut from the rig and I had
fun hitting it when I hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, you guys,
now that the show is over, please go to
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes or Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the iTunes or the Stitcher main
