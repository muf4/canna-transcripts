[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did invite me to be a guest on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made two appearances recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may recognize this t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the Dude Grow Show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recorded a great segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do look forward to that coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure their production schedule,
when they're going to drop the episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it should be fairly close to the same
time that this episode does come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thanks to all of my friends at
the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude, Scotty, and of course,
our new friend, Grambo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody, the old school
crew and the new crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just discovered me from the Dude
Grows show, thanks for joining us,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to be part of the Dude Grows
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri Army Dude Grows crew is a very
parallel crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like being a team together,
so shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel any sort of competition or
territorial insecurity crap when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to multiple podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should all do our own shows and
help everybody and be a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why we shouldn't work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in aiming for the same goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want you guys to grow the best herb
and we want to legalize our favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to my friend,
J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did get the same t-shirt,
joke, you're the only one going to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: joke, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you laughed at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be on there more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did talk about me going on that show
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm only doing one episode per
week here, it does allow me to do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more guest spot time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doorbell rang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I'm going to go grab that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording here in the middle of the
day, so we did receive a package at the
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't leave packages out there too long
because other people will decide that that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a gift or donation if they see it on
the porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to go get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something that we have
all seen in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the cannabis podcast should talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that got quite a few
people kind of excited, kind of riled up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we saw a lot of responses to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am referring to the statement
that Joe Biden made about freeing federal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis prisoners who were in federal
prison for petty cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk really briefly about what Biden
said there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said a bunch of bullshit to make
people think he was going to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't say anything useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't do anything useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's break down what he said really
quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going to free federal cannabis
prisoners who were in federal prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: minor cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you commit a minor cannabis crime,
you don't go to federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: A federal crime is how you go to federal
prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those minor cannabis crimes went to county
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal crimes went to federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who he released?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a greeting card to make you
feel like something went well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really do a lot for the movement,
for the plant, for the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am misinformed, uneducated,
and some people did get released,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pardoned one or two people,
that is great, but it's not the move that
[SPEAKER_00]: we all thought he was talking about
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were duped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were fooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a clever statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a sales pitch, and it did
not work on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that what he said was just some
frosting, or a band-aid, or just some
[SPEAKER_00]: decoration, and I didn't buy the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give you my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he freed all of the federal
cannabis prisoners who were in prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: minor cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, you don't go to a federal
prison for a minor cannabis crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never made it that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nobody to free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my ramble on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something more fun,
more exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you do know that I had a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: running, and I did harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is down now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of plants still in
there until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some long-standing, some late finishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were plants that I did not expect to
take so long that took a really long time
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, but they are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the plants have been processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are getting counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited because I think that by
Halloween, I should be able to re-drop the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On ireadirect.com, on other vendors,
there will be a restock of blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: butcher by Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that 10 times fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry butcher is back in stock,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around Halloween time, I do plan a sale
and a Halloween drop for the restock of
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more stuff that drops along
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every order on ireadirect.com does come
with freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I load you up for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on if you buy cheap packs or
more expensive packs, it depends on if I
[SPEAKER_00]: load you up with five packs or 10 packs or
Femmes for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's a pretty close to buy one
get one free ratio with the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies that you do get, but I am
rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blueberry butcher drop will happen
around Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some new stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys have heard me talk about
the feminized seeds that I have got
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are harvested as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are kind of big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking longer to dry than
anticipated, but as soon as they're dried,
[SPEAKER_00]: processed, counted, all of that good shit,
I will get you guys the feminized lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feminized orangegasm and the feminized
golden goat S1s will be back very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to stay updated on that is to
join my newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to my website, ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom of the page, there is a
newsletter tab where you can fill in your
[SPEAKER_00]: email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that and it will update your
email address in my newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put out new drops, when I put out
specials, when I do promotions or
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising, I do send out a MailChimp
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really only try to do it about once a
month, maybe every six weeks, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to overload you and bombard you
with spam emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to remind you that,
hey, I put hoodies on sale, or hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I put seeds on sale, or hey, there's a new
drop coming, or hey, there's a secret
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to stay updated with all of
that stuff is, of course, through the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter at ireagenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ordered more iregenetics t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered black long sleeve t-shirts and I
ordered black hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the ladies, I ordered a few
iregenetics tank tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all got the square logo with the
cross that says iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been asking for more designs,
more ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put that logo on a few different
items, long sleeve black shirts,
[SPEAKER_00]: black t-shirts, black hoodies,
and black tank tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will branch out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to get all the bases covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we got the basics covered,
I will expand the merchandise line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got recommendations or
suggestions, send me those ideas at
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be Grow From Your Heart idea
merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be iregenetics merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you've got in mind, please do
hook me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love making merchandise that I know you
guys are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could design shit that I like all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're an artist out there,
I could use a discreet iregenetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: irearmy logo, something that people in
prohibition states could wear and they
[SPEAKER_00]: could proudly represent iregenetics,
the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the irearmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could represent all of that stuff,
but not tell their boss their community,
[SPEAKER_00]: their neighbors, the preschool teacher,
the daycare worker, that they are cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to whip up a cool logo,
please do send me your ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will definitely take good care of my
favorite logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is enough rambling here at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I was going to talk about
phenotype selection and a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me segue into rambling a little bit
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a good spot to start would be
by explaining what a phenohunt is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by a phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: A phenohunt is simply searching through a
population of seeds to find the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: of those plants that works the best for
you, your garden, your clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: your needs, or your patients, whatever it
may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do I mean by phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we grow from seed, we will see
variation amongst the different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is known as a phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants, so we may have a 10 pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are regular seeds, most of the
time, half of those are going to be males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pull the boys out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got five girl plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, you're going to see
plants that look a little bit like the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant, plants that look a little
bit like the father plant, and then plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like combinations of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call those the 50-50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are usually my intended and favorite
phenotypes, but that's a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like if you've got brothers or
sisters, you don't look exactly the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you came from the exact same parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you do look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got blue eyes, your sister's
got green eyes, maybe you've got brown
[SPEAKER_00]: hair and your sister's got blonde hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a phenotypical expression and
variation that happens amongst phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: With plants, some plants may be taller
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may be shorter than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may get a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may not make any resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may have a certain aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may have way different aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all traits that we will see as
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about a phenohunt,
I'm talking about finding the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a population that works best for my
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me get off on a tangent here
because being a breeder, being the person
[SPEAKER_00]: that is making a lot of these seeds and
that has a lot of experience with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that I make, when I make these
seeds, I get to grow them first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to play with them as long as I want
before I even let you know about it or
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them to you or give them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running them a lot, so I know
what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you get the seeds, I can tell you
what phenotypes will show up and the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits of those phenotypes that you can
expect from a pack of seeds because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got experience running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran the seeds so much that I know
what it's going to show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I talk about phenotypical
selection, people often say, which
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype is the best out of this line of
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not for me to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often describe it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted a pack of, let me just say,
strawberry starburst seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that you want the seeds that have
the strawberry candy flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make really good concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice sativa buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that that's as far as we've
gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a phenotype in there that's
going to be perfect for you and one that
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be the best for you and one that'll
be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I describe this is we've all
chosen that we want to eat at the Italian
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all chosen we want the Italian
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your strawberry starburst pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get to the Italian restaurant,
we're going to get a menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to want white sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to want red sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody's going to want eggplant
parmesan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to want gnocchi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to want pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a million kinds of pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gnocchi or spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things that are at the
Italian restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all very acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all kind of the same because
they're Italian food made in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant, but there's going to be little
variations and differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think we find when we go
growing from a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the Italian restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your pack of strawberry starburst
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got to find the phenotype that
expresses the traits that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the marinara or do you want
the garlic sauce?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the seeds, to the
strawberry starburst plant, do you want
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that tastes more like watermelons
or bubblegum candy or the one that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: that weird sour sort of a tangy and
watermelon and grapefruit sort of aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for you to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the one that tastes like strawberry
bubblegum, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Kelvin likes the one that tastes
like juicy watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the phenotype that will get your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the trait and the phenotype that
will get your attention that works best
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the phenotype that works for me may not
be best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a head buzz that makes me paranoid
and fucking forget what I'm saying and
[SPEAKER_00]: lose my keys when they're in my hand and
lose my sunglasses when I'm wearing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't desire that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may want totally different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a grow space that's eight feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a three foot tall grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: My phenotypes aren't going to work in your
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my best advice is to pick the phenotype
that works best for you in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, for your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, maybe it's a medical
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a retail product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a gray market product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're making concentrates out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're making edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select the phenotype that performs the way
that you need that phenotype to perform
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to reach your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
method of a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pheno hunt can happen with a little bit
of seeds or a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can happen in a little bit of space or
a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm hunting for something, I don't grow
the plants very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't even take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just rely on a revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mainly looking for the one keeper out
of a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I took a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did not get the clone, then I will
rely on that revege and it will be worth
[SPEAKER_00]: the work because it was the keeper out of
however many plants, which means that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the one I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be worth doing the extra work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever amount of space you've got,
whatever amount of seeds you got,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's utilize that to the best of our
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe small plants, short veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing a pheno hunt, I do not
manipulate the plants very much on their
[SPEAKER_00]: first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you've got, okay,
let's do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I live, I'm only allowed to grow 12
plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my pheno hunt, let's just say I've
already got two plants as mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're over there in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 10 plants that I'm allowed to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pop a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me 10 seeds to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, like I've said before,
we're going to pull out five because
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll probably be males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to grow these 10 seeds
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put them in a room and I'm
going to treat them all exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the same soil, the same size pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get fed the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get defoliated the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do any manipulation to plant one,
it happens to plant one through 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other plants are getting the same
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only way to keep it fair,
scientific, and actually make a real
[SPEAKER_00]: discernible determination on which plant
is the best or most desirable out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will grow all these plants exactly
the fucking same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somewhere around week six or
seven, you'll start making decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go, this one right here has a lot
of resin, but this one right here is
[SPEAKER_00]: making a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there'll be another one that
doesn't make as much resin or as much
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, but smells and tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually the way that a pheno hunt
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep growing those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on re-vegging, leave a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here comes the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing these plants to share
with friends or patients or clients or
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever it may be, gather a few of them
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a smoke party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll up a couple of joints of phenotype
number one, phenotype number two,
[SPEAKER_00]: number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke them with the whole crew and
see who desires what.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing it for yourself,
pick the one you like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the grower, if you're going to
breed with it, if you've got goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: you make the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the advantage of being the grower,
the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to make that final decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let people say, I like this one
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this one the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, it's your decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a good eye on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them all exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then decide which one was your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your keeper out of your pheno
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, like I said before,
you'll find two or three that are the
[SPEAKER_00]: winners out of a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of treat that like a bracket
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will re-veg those or have clones of
those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will run them all three side by
side in a room kind of focused into just
[SPEAKER_00]: those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll see what works the best for me
out of those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I keep two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I keep one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll keep the tall one for
myself and send the short one to a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: so that he can run that also and kind of
experiment with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see what we can do with the
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll breed to both of them, see what the
breeding does on both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just phenotypical selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep the taller one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll get the shorter one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But find the one that you like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a minute ago, I said, we could do a
pheno hunt from 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be really fun to run 100 at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that rate, you might need 100
clones if you want to clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that rate, you've got to manage 100
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most areas, that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we can do this is if you can
run 10 at a time, or this works however
[SPEAKER_00]: many you can run at a time, max out and
then do the math on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you've got 100 seeds and
you can run 10 at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick your favorite out of those 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprout nine more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run that clone and those nine seeds right
next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, pick the best out of all
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first clone you kept last time does
not have to be the keeper out of the next
[SPEAKER_00]: round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work it like a bracket system,
an elimination match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you won the last fucking Royal
Rumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in the ring with 10 more and see if
you fucking survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time, as long as you select a
phenotype that you think is better through
[SPEAKER_00]: every pheno hunt, you're making forward
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also making product every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a waste of time or a waste
of space because you're producing those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be the most desirable,
the most sellable, most profitable smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: ever, but you're going to produce a
quality product out of each one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if you do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a good way to segue into
another thing that I wanted to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people expect to plant a seed and
find the perfect phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't sell one or two seeds
to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you've got to buy a pack of
seeds because that's not a good
[SPEAKER_00]: representation .
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, if you buy one seed and it
doesn't germinate, you've got 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: non-germination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that looks really bad on a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to give you more seeds to at least
get some to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want you to complain that it
gives you better numbers, a better ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tested my germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testers have tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers, customers have tested that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the seeds are reliable,
but it still feels weird selling you one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two because then you got a chance of
100 or 50% failure rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be it could have gotten too hot
in shipping or that simply could be
[SPEAKER_00]: customer error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to allow for that sort of
a ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you should run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when you get one seed or two
seeds, I think you should run more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that to actually find the phenotype that
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people think that their first
grow is going to be the grow where they
[SPEAKER_00]: find the gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you got to run a pack,
maybe two, maybe three packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like dating in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just find one person and fall in
love right off the bat, that's great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not common.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to kind of play the field and see
like does that kind of person make me
[SPEAKER_00]: happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this person make me happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're not locked into one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Date a little bit with these plants is
what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for the bad dating analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done that in a while,
so I'm fucking confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But find out which plant you like the best
and stick with that and then grow that one
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then develop a relationship with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple times you grow it,
it'll come out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine if you learn that like in week
six, I could drop out the Kalamag and
[SPEAKER_00]: really add bloom boosters and it goes
shebang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you need to feed it nitrogen just
a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you discover that if you let it
go five extra days, it really puts on more
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So run a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with the population of seeds and
grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them all exactly the same to keep it
scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry them, cure them, smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Determine your favorites out of that
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your keeper phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the basics of a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more seeds of the same thing
or if you've got different seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking to keep the best plant
around, run another phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that one plant that won the last round
in up against all those other plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: see who is the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it the Royal Rumble before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the Royal Rumble going until you've
got the best plant you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to stock a stable of
mother plants, repeat this process until
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got 10 of the best mother plants
you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got 10 mothers to keep clones
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep working with those or however
you may need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need one mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're looking for a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a phenohunt with the male plant
the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to flower it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare it to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the traits you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can find that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, then you've got to do some
pollen chucking, which is a whole other
[SPEAKER_00]: slew of podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I gave you the basics of a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically run the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the one that rings your bell,
not my bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to live with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pick the one that works best for you,
your patients, your clients, your market,
[SPEAKER_00]: your wallet, your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep all of that stuff in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to run it indoors and
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a clone, let's say I took 10
clones off of a plant and send it to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all going to send me back 10
pictures with subtle variations because
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure deficit differences,
lighting differences, medium differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient differences, defoliation
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are going to make a
difference in the phenotypical expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you change anything in the grow,
it may change a lot of stuff and the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've rambled long enough about
selecting a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your favorite, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot like dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pick that favorite one, build a good
relationship with it, dial it in and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it like a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got that one figured out,
then unlike dating, then at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you can move on and do another
phenohunt and find another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you got some variety in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I've got for you for this
episode, ladies and gentlemen.
