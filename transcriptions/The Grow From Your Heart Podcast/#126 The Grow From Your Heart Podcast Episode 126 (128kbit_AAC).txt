[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for episode number 126 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_05]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_05]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_05]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I want to thank my buddy,
White Mike, for joining me again.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing today, brother?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: I am doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that we got this recording equipment
figured out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we spent some time working on the
sounds so that this sounded great for all
[SPEAKER_04]: of you out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, 126 episodes into the
show, I opened up the recording software
[SPEAKER_05]: and hit go, and the recording equipment
was just giving me the middle finger.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, no, not today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Took a couple of dry runs to get her
going, sounding right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got her fired up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've done more damage to my head
working on this podcast than I did at all
[SPEAKER_04]: of the concerts I saw in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Working well?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just said it's working.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's working good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's working well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's work on our English skills today,
class.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, I apologize for the headphone
malfunctions there.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what was going on with this
equipment today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was super loud, and then it was super
quiet, and then it was extra loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys just want a quality show,
so let's get into that part.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to read some news articles.
[SPEAKER_05]: We may actually play a news article,
but first, let's talk about another email
[SPEAKER_05]: that I did not include in the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might have been a Facebook
message is why I missed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to our friend Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rasta Seb has had a little bit of bad
luck, but things will turn around for your
[SPEAKER_05]: brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad for what happened to you,
but Rasta Seb sent me a question asking,
[SPEAKER_05]: what is reclaim?
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't laugh at the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to remember, not everybody is
smoking four and five grams of hash on
[SPEAKER_05]: their day off.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, perfectly valid question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: No giggles at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, a lot of people in Colorado
would be like, well, it's a reclaim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reclaim is this, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: For all you folks out there who are not
able to consume a whole bunch of Earl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoiled hash brat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talk to people all day who have,
I don't even bother to get to reclaim with
[SPEAKER_04]: them because I already gave them a
thesaurus worth of fucking information.
[SPEAKER_04]: The look on Mike's face was priceless
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let me tell you what reclaim is.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we use a dab rig, we put a nail
attached to the rig somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It either sits on the outside of a male
joint, or it sits on the inside of the
[SPEAKER_05]: male joint, and then you put a dome on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, you heat up that nail,
and then you put some hash onto there,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you inhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you inhale, some of that hash oil will
collect onto your rig, just like the resin
[SPEAKER_05]: collects on your pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you doing good so far, Mike?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as we vaporize the hash before it all
gets to us, some of it unvaporizes and
[SPEAKER_04]: reconstitutes itself into a reclaim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a lot of times, that'll fill up in.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're smoking BHO, I highly recommend
you using a rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call the rig a pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bong, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a small bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like a little small bubbler.
[SPEAKER_05]: A special little hash bong, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it a rig, but I like something
small.
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly recommend you smoke with
something with water in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want that bubble action to cool it
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hash is really hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cool it a little bit before it gets
to your lungs and throat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll really help you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times, the water will collect a
lot of reclaim in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of claim in the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of claim on the entryway to
the pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times, I'll use what's called a
drop down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm grabbing my drop down right now to get
a nice visual.
[SPEAKER_05]: The drop down goes onto the rig where the
nail would normally go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an extension of glass.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll actually go a little lower to get
the nail out of your face a little bit and
[SPEAKER_05]: get it further away from your head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the nail goes on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a lot of the oil, the reclaim oil,
will collect right into here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some here that we can talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably a measurement of one dram.
[SPEAKER_05]: One half dram, I think, is what that would
be probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you poured it out, it'd be half a dram.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those little tiny vials,
they'd be half of one of those is what I
[SPEAKER_05]: think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a half a dram of reclaim that I
could remove from here and do something
[SPEAKER_05]: with.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what reclaim is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically reconstituted hash oil
that's stuck to my piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can you do with it was one of his
follow-up questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people just stick the dabber
inside of this mucky part and pull it out
[SPEAKER_05]: and redab it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people will do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our friend 44, he would do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not against his standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of people go for dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people who take great care
to clean it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then try to dry it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drying it out is the part that I would
make sure you do really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave it on some parchment paper or on an
oil slick pad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you let it dry really well
before you try to dab it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to one dude who was cleaning his
rig with Everclear so that he could throw
[SPEAKER_04]: that into a glass dish when he was done
agitating and getting his rig all clean
[SPEAKER_04]: and then slowly evaporate that back down
into reclaim powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our friend Gary was teaching me
about that a while back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shut out Gary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you still listen to the
show, but he was talking about doing
[SPEAKER_05]: something very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our friend Fox was CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD extracts run CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what he would say would be to make
edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another use that I know a number of
people do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already been decarboxylized or
decarboxylated?
[SPEAKER_05]: Iced.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look like you just picked one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say you just picked one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said them both in my head and I was
like, no, the first one sounds like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been decarbed because it's been
heated to a temperature above a certain
[SPEAKER_05]: beyond four.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been heated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know how hot the surface of
this nail is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is really hot, but it's been heated
above that and it's reconstituted.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been activated essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you eat it, it's already broken
down so that your body doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_05]: break it down as much to make the
psychoactive components bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was deep on accident,
but okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what reclaim is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may be an asshole because what I do with
it is I fill my rig with rubbing alcohol
[SPEAKER_05]: and I shake it up real good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I pour that down the drain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ironically, for some reason,
my garbage disposal doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too high, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't eat anything that would really
clog that thing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't put anything down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just need some love.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like 90% sure I need to pour a bottle
of ISO down my garbage disposal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's my only problem is it's
just all resiny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a whole bunch of reclaim in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine times out of 10, I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I've got a big fat glob of reclaim
sitting somewhere that's easy to get to,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll use my torch to extract it real
quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of heat it up, make it turn into
liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn it into basically a liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then pour it into a silicone
container.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I use it for seasoning my nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great use for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it's the only reason I keep it
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I only do it when I've got like a
really fat glob sitting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause what I've got now, I could season a
hundred nails with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to get another question.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell does he mean season your
nail?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get a new titanium nail,
just like any skillet that you would want
[SPEAKER_05]: to cook on any pan that you're going to
cook on, you're going to want to put some
[SPEAKER_05]: oil or fatty substance on it to grease it
up before you cook on it so that you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: taste that iron, that cast iron.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to taste cast iron on
whatever you're cooking.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're making some asparagus in there,
if you're making pork chops, you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: want to taste fucking cast iron.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't want to just taste raw
titanium.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I get a new nail, I'll heat it up
just to about dab temperature and I'll let
[SPEAKER_05]: it cool so that the oil will puddle on
there and kind of soak into the pores of
[SPEAKER_05]: the nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to kind of season your nail
before you start dabbing with the brand
[SPEAKER_05]: new titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can do it with quartz also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you get a quartz nail perfectly
seasoned, it's so smooth and tastes
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got to hit a really nice quartz
banger recently and it tasted really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to a Bobo Blaster Co and the
traveling stoner and sloppy nine one nine
[SPEAKER_05]: and whoever else Buzzy probably was in the
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where you were bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, did I give a shout out to Lindsay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave a shout out to Lindsay on the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: That episode came out really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You did a great job on the show and Mike,
you were awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we're going to get Mike and Lindsay
back on another episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, a listener sent a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I wasn't even prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me grab my phone and we'll read a
Facebook message right quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was a fun show to record.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some good feedback on it from some
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: This Facebook message stemmed from that
episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pulling it up on my phone right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is impromptu.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not prepared to talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to wait till you guys were
both here, but uh, it seems like a fair
[SPEAKER_05]: time to mention this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: This comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, Oh, and she has replied to my
reply.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, I listened to this podcast and
was sad to hear that the Libertarian
[SPEAKER_05]: candidates were ignored or were entirely
ignored.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary Johnson is way better than Sanders on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnson, besides owning an extract
company, even admits to using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when Hillary Bertz beats Bernie,
which she will, and then she leaves us a
[SPEAKER_05]: link to follow so that we can read about a
Libertarian future.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm, uh, I'm very familiar with Gary
Johnson.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm just a realist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Gary's awesome, but, uh, Gary don't
have a shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, she said, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually rooting for Bernie for the
dem nomination, but my heart is with Gary
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnson.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, it's not totally impossible
for Gary Johnson.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I don't know enough about that to
have an opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like Mike does.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I do have an opinion on is that,
um, Elizabeth, I appreciate your
[SPEAKER_05]: interaction with the podcast on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you ever have any more questions or
anything you'd like to say, feel free to
[SPEAKER_05]: throw it up there on the Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Libertarian candidate is typically far
better on marijuana policy than the
[SPEAKER_04]: Democrat or the Republican candidates,
but, uh, they don't have a shot right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we just don't have that third party
infrastructure in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike knows a lot of political shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a buzzword champion, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I listened to that episode because of
course I clean them up a little bit before
[SPEAKER_05]: I put them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody pauses for too long or says,
shit, they want taken out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll cut it out for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, listening back to that episode,
you were buzzword king.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just getting my mind every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, we talked about reclaim shout out
to Rasta Seb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, he said, I owe you one bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: You helped me out one time, uh,
by contributing to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you may be in a time of
need.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anything that Mike and I can do
for you, Mike, I just volunteered your
[SPEAKER_05]: services to our buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can do anything for you,
bro, let me know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I owe you one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what we could do,
but if something comes up that you think
[SPEAKER_05]: of, send me an email, send me a Facebook
message.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get it on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, our next, uh, article, our next topic
is going to be a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to go to the internet for
this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually going to play a quick video
clip from channel 13 news here in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado and Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it says, I should give credit to Katie
Spencer, who is a multimedia journalist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the cannabis clubs in Colorado Springs
United and did something great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, they were giving away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Free joints to people who volunteered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this all of them or was this some of
them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a small group.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a group of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was more than one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was more than
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The article should tell us, but I saw our
friends from one shop posting about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw the guy on this news articles
from another shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know how many of the places
participated, but I'll play the news
[SPEAKER_05]: article for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what they did was they were giving
away a free joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you participated in their litter
cleanup program, if you went and picked up
[SPEAKER_05]: one bag of trash and brought it back to
the organizer of this event, he would give
[SPEAKER_05]: you a free joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's an image of him standing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, he's standing in the park
with a bowl of dude tubes full of joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got the joints aren't exposed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in little containers, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I would have organized this event,
it would be an organized slightly
[SPEAKER_04]: different, but I love it for what it is
and what it did for the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's not a hundred percent like put
your best foot forward necessarily as far
[SPEAKER_04]: as optics go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do joints for picking up trash all the way
clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if you could smoke the joint
while you pick up trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that'd make it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't do that though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not legally in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole thing with Hannah and
about, cause I'm sure plenty of people did
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was just bring me a bag of trash,
get a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there were plenty of people who
brought him several bags of trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how many people went and cleaned
out their car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope not many.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, I'd like to see, see more of
the industry doing stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the consumption clubs can really push
the boundaries with like giving away
[SPEAKER_04]: product and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the, the shops can't even give away
product legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to charge at least a penny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way a dispensary would be able to
do that would to be if they checked your
[SPEAKER_05]: ID before they let you sign up for the
program, and then they would have to give
[SPEAKER_05]: you a coupon that may give you a joint for
a penny because they can't give you
[SPEAKER_05]: anything for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then you'd have to go back to that
shop and get the joint for a penny with
[SPEAKER_04]: your coupons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then didn't you just technically you're
employed by that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that happens, you're like kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they're just handing out coupons.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's who they hand coupons to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this does, I don't know if you could
claim that's employment, but like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that a stink would get raised if
a dispensary actually did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Too many hoops to jump through for the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody would pay tax money on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the shop would have to pay the taxes
on that as though it's sold at normal
[SPEAKER_04]: price.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet would be the bite that the shop
would have to take.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, like there's a shop down here
that's adopted a strip of highway and I
[SPEAKER_04]: drive that strip of highway every day and
it's always fucking filthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I shake my head every time I drive and
see that sign.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they need to get out there and clean it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's their part of the highway,
their little redheaded stepchild part of
[SPEAKER_05]: highway, part of the highway is all dirty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out there and fulfill your obligation
and shout out to the shot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumption clubs that did this event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish more of the industry was thinking
of stuff like this to help clean up or
[SPEAKER_04]: better their little part of the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to play the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I got to get the volumes correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize if things go wonky here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how loud this is going to be
because it is coming from the,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, news 13 website.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Colorado Springs Cannabis Club
offering free marijuana today to those who
[SPEAKER_00]: helped pick up trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dozens of volunteers showed up to help the
pothole Cannabis Club clean up Vermejo
[SPEAKER_00]: Park into other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And KRDO News Channel 13's Katie Spencer
tagged along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new at five o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal of Sunday's get together,
making Colorado Springs more beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: One trash bag at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we're going to go out here on the west
side and clean up, uh, down here off of
[SPEAKER_03]: Cimarron and, uh, the park off of 26th.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effort started here at Vermejo Park
where volunteers were picking up trash for
[SPEAKER_02]: a unique reward.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you bring bags of trash back to me,
I'm going to give you a joint per bag you
[SPEAKER_03]: bring back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those cleaning up, it wasn't just
about the free weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hike every single day and I see trash on
every single trail and it saddens me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a personal connection to their
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels good to actually, um,
go pick the trash up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't mind it because I use
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the trail cleaning up the park as
well as the reputation of the marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: To show that we are a positive impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's nothing wrong with weed
and there's nothing wrong with our kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado Springs, Katie Spencer,
KRDO News Channel 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: They picked up a lot of trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The club hopes to continue the cleanups
every month and move to other parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every month that'd be cool to see
people picking up trash for pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that shows you guys, we're not just a
bunch of lazy stoners.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do contribute to the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want it to be cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at the park, chilling out,
enjoying our buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want it to be clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to look around and see trash
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this weird myth out there that
because we're associated with marijuana,
[SPEAKER_04]: like we want everything to be bad and
destroyed and stoned or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like bad people and it's just
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're people just like everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, we like cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I've noticed being around
potheads a lot for the past 20 years is a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of them have OCD, especially,
and I may sound sexist, but this is just
[SPEAKER_05]: what I've observed.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of women get, got to clean some shit
OCD.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get stoned and they're like,
oh, those dishes are dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just go clean the dishes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not, it's just cause in their
mind they're like, those dishes can't be
[SPEAKER_05]: dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's driving me crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they do the damn dishes and pot heads
get the same OCD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's trash everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to pick it up, make my environment
look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just easier and more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a boy scout back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was important to the people around
me that like when we went camping,
[SPEAKER_04]: not only did we do zero impact camping,
so like, or leave no trace camping,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like we actively pay attention and
grab other trash while we were out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we always had one pocket full of
other people's bullshit, like on the way
[SPEAKER_04]: back to camp at night, just so that next
time we were up there, it was a little
[SPEAKER_04]: better than it was this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I do it at my house too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when it's been crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy windy down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every night when I get home,
I spend like two minutes picking up other
[SPEAKER_04]: people's trash out of my front yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we should put up a net.
[SPEAKER_05]: The past few days we've needed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A trash net would be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a shout out to Four Pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you follow at Four Pieces on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure their website and stuff,
but if you check them out on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_05]: Four Pieces is an organization that
encourages you to pick up four pieces of
[SPEAKER_05]: trash per day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't matter where you find them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it kind of does.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to go take them out of the
dumpster or some shit, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: do your part, pick up four pieces of trash
per day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a picture of it, post it up on Four
Pieces, encourage other people to pick up
[SPEAKER_05]: four pieces of trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm continuously blown away by shit I see
out in the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's the Starbucks cup doing in my
parking lot?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it wasn't there 20 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go on hikes and I find the weirdest shit
on hikes and I'll be far from like the car
[SPEAKER_05]: or wherever there is, I'm far from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, how did people bring a fucking
pie and some forks out here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what were these people doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why couldn't they just take their pie
container back?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pie container in a bunch of plastic forks
and I found a stop sign out in the middle
[SPEAKER_05]: of nowhere one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just cleaning your shit up.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are way off on a tangent here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know how we ended up in this
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the news article, picking up trash for
joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, yeah, think it all the way
through, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not give out the joints in the park
next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That looked a little weird on the news
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one thing that everybody sort
of has against the consumption clubs is
[SPEAKER_04]: that some of them have found a way to do
some sort of distribution and we're giving
[SPEAKER_04]: joints away in the park for bringing us
bags of trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's an awesome program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, getting people to clean up trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care how you do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to jump in and interrupt you and
do my part for the consumption clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to avoid the word distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would much rather hear the word
reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and I'm just educating you and our
listeners so that when you, if you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: come to a consumption club, don't say
purchase, don't say buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say, may I reimburse you for some of that
fine quality product there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like reimbursement is the key word in
these places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is why it's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you fuckers vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sick of word games.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just call them all fuckers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just talking about headshots.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't mean it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just talking about how some head
shops in Colorado are still playing the
[SPEAKER_04]: water pipe game because they have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's because enough of our generation
isn't voting regularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The water pipe game.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to find the water pipe game
because some people might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, when you come into my marijuana store,
I'm happy to show you the bongs on my
[SPEAKER_04]: shelf and tell you how much my bongs cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if the head shop up the road shows you
the exact same thing, they're not allowed
[SPEAKER_04]: to call it a bong because if it's a bong,
it might be used for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's used for marijuana,
it's not really legal, legal to sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still against federal law because you
called it a bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's 2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should be able to say, can I check out
that bong?
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, really is 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually 2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be saying, can I get that rig?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sick of the word games.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's legal in Colorado now, and there are
still places where you have to say water
[SPEAKER_04]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a huge advocate for consumption
clubs and learning another word game makes
[SPEAKER_04]: that harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that segues into my next news
article because you said consumption clubs
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're a big fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this article says this is from the
Indy, the Colorado Springs independent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was by Nat Stein.
[SPEAKER_05]: The article headline says city council
bans cannabis clubs knowing full well
[SPEAKER_05]: lawsuit is coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is shocking news because just a
few days ago we were told they had eight
[SPEAKER_05]: years to get their shit together to recoup
their investments.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really weird decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're too dangerous to be open,
but they have eight years to recoup their
[SPEAKER_04]: expenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, well, which is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the article goes a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice trying to hide that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that real well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to cover that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, those Mountain Dew cans are fucking
fierce.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just, you call them fuckers and cheers
bitches.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're having a great night, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I drank this whole- It was like one
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just glad to be getting the show
recorded at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gingerade kombucha.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, there might,
I might, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel strange from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say there's alcohol in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every time you drink, I see random
things floating in the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kombucha.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have a nice little kombucha buzz
going on to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, this article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The clubs, which were membership based,
social clubs that allow for adult
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana use have caused consternation
for city officials for several years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They first started springing up after
voter approved amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2013, 2014, excuse me, studio a 64 won
a zoning violation appeal in which the
[SPEAKER_05]: city granted the downtown club as similar
use determination.
[SPEAKER_05]: In essence saying that cannabis clubs are
like social clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are areas zoned as such.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in parentheses, it says permitted
in multifamily, residential, commercial,
[SPEAKER_05]: and industrial zone districts.
[SPEAKER_05]: More clubs opened up all over town.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even after the six month moratorium on new
marijuana business licensing began in
[SPEAKER_05]: September, the city couldn't stop issuing
a license that did not exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then earlier this month, the planning
commission recommended banning the clubs
[SPEAKER_05]: outright.
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Don Knight took the ordinance to
council proposing the group prohibit the
[SPEAKER_05]: opening of any new clubs mandate licensure
for all clubs that operated prior to the
[SPEAKER_05]: moratorium, subject to all sorts of new
rules and forced those clubs to close
[SPEAKER_05]: doors after eight years.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the ordinance council gave a final
reading on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Bill Murray moved to the table
the ordinance for six months.
[SPEAKER_05]: So council could work with the industry to
develop more moderate regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, council voted six to three in
favor of adopting Knight's original
[SPEAKER_05]: proposal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilors Jill Gabler and Helen Collins
joined Murray in voting no.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about limited government all the
time, but limited government is not about
[SPEAKER_05]: number of employees.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about limited laws, Murray said.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're turning democracy into a morality
play.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gabler said she was skeptical of the
public process behind the measure or lack
[SPEAKER_05]: thereof.
[SPEAKER_05]: Collins on her part said she didn't think
a ban would be constitutional.
[SPEAKER_05]: Knight and Councilor Keith King both
argued that council had already exercised
[SPEAKER_05]: its right under amendment 64 to opt out of
the retail side of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Knight cited articles from the Gazette and
Fox News as proof.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those articles highlight the clubs
practice of offering marijuana to patrons
[SPEAKER_05]: who didn't bring their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes in exchange for a donation or
reimbursement, assisting other adult in
[SPEAKER_05]: the use of marijuana is permissible under
act 64, is what this article says.
[SPEAKER_05]: This article is written in two different
colors, so I apologize for my stutter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes my eyes jump around when it's in
two colors like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that if you type some shit,
that's rude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Club owners and goers took their
opportunity during basic public comment to
[SPEAKER_05]: try and correct some misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amber Racic, owner of studio A64,
insisted that cannabis clubs are benign
[SPEAKER_05]: relative to bars that serve alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: She says, I get off at 1 a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: in the morning, and every time I drive
downtown, I see people outside the bars,
[SPEAKER_05]: stumbling around, causing problems,
getting into fights.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are peaceful, peaceful people,
she said.
[SPEAKER_05]: All we want is a place to be accepted as
human beings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking weed is how we choose to relax,
and it isn't hurting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Presence Mercure, I hope I said that
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patron and cousin of a local club owner
took a different tack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you hate pot, that's fine,
she said, but we all love money,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about what you'd gain from these
clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's such a good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's kind of a tasteless way to
say it, but I mean, it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about all the money that you're
gonna miss out on if they close all of
[SPEAKER_05]: these clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shutting down a bunch of businesses,
I mean, you lose a lot more than the sales
[SPEAKER_04]: tax, payroll tax, property tax,
business tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of the money that those
employees go spend back in your community?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and all of this is silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there are places in the world that
already have these clubs zoned and
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo County happens to be one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado Springs isn't one, so they're
pretending like it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because they're refusing to throw
rules down and just be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_04]: follow these, apply here, and be done with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna be doing this nonsense for
the next half decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to figure out that loophole of
how people can reimburse the club for the
[SPEAKER_05]: product that they use there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems to be the- Or like the club has
to have a way to survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, a lot of the rules that are
in place are like they can't do anything
[SPEAKER_04]: other than sell prepackaged drinks and
snacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't even do like cold
sandwiches, let alone like decent food.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: No way to reimburse for the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you pay your rent at that point,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you exist as an entity?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how far out in the middle of
nowhere do they wanna push it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like eventually, it's just gonna be like
cousin Earl's farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then that's pointless.
[SPEAKER_05]: We like having a place in the congregating
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some dude with 50 acres and a big house
and a barn in the middle of it's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: slap up an ad on the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, I've been in those
situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been out in the middle of nowhere
smoking because we had to hide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been to gatherings in every
environment you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: From some random dude's house,
to some hippie's house, to some gangster's
[SPEAKER_05]: house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in every environment smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those social clubs are the ideal,
safest environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing's gonna go wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not on somebody's turf.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in a club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, hang out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You paid the entry fee.
[SPEAKER_05]: You showed us your ID.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're part of our club.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have anything against you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody here is in a different club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a video that I saw years and
years ago where they're interviewing a
[SPEAKER_04]: coffee shop owner in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what the consumption club in
Amsterdam are called.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says he's been open for like 15
years and he goes, there's never been a
[SPEAKER_04]: fight in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes to the bar across the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: The police are there every night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every night.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, it's just a different,
it's a different type of intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't come with that aggressive
tinge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see anti-pop people linking like anytime
there's a violent incident and marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: gets mentioned, like they post it up as
though it was directly caused by.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, well, then you wouldn't
have had to go to Texas to find this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like your town sold $17 million worth of
weed last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if it was being caused, you could
link that article from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problems with the clubs are just,
they annoy people that really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really hate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the biggest problem caused by
allowing consumption clubs is that you
[SPEAKER_04]: annoy the squeaky wheel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it a few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're old.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's never been a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's never been any trouble there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to continue with this article,
uh, joking that being from Denver
[SPEAKER_05]: shouldn't be held against him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Activist attorney Rob Corey reminded
council that amendment 64, which he had a
[SPEAKER_05]: hand in drafting protects the activities
in question in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adults have the right to associate with
each other, consume marijuana,
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivate it, distribute it, and help
others with all of those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, that's the supreme law of the
land.
[SPEAKER_05]: The voters have spoken.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just like the other constitutional
rights, which council members swore to
[SPEAKER_05]: uphold the rights afforded by amendment 20
and amendment 64 are non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Corey said that may be difficult for you,
but that is the reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jill Gaber asked Corey how other
municipalities in the state are dealing
[SPEAKER_05]: with cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a single one has banned them because
they can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: He answered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus a city devoid of venues for social
consumption creates other problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: He explained marijuana will be smoked by
adults in groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what you do, you can't prevent
me from inviting 50 of my closest friends
[SPEAKER_05]: over to smoke pot together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where are they going to go?
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming soon to a neighborhood near you,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they banned the clubs, we'll just open
the front door, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just come on everybody in everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come just take some dads in my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start diving with some
really interesting people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go that route.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's part of the beauty of the
club.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that because I would go to the club
once or twice a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would make an effort to show up once a
week or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I got to about once every two
weeks during trim time because we were
[SPEAKER_05]: just busy, but once or twice a week,
I'll pop in there and try to spend an hour
[SPEAKER_05]: there and say hi to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would always meet new people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes I'd meet people that I wish
would walk away, but most of the time I
[SPEAKER_05]: would meet people that are like,
damn, I'm glad I'm friends with that guy
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like most of the people I've met in the
community and I wish I could spend more
[SPEAKER_04]: time with the consumption clubs and I
haven't felt that way about a bar in
[SPEAKER_04]: forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the gray area they exist, it just
annoys the shit out of me at this point in
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just ridiculous at this point and
that the more people don't see it as
[SPEAKER_04]: ridiculous, it's starting to really annoy
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said this so many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can we have so many bars, but we can't
have somewhere to smoke cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems unfair.
[SPEAKER_04]: The retort that I always get for that is,
well, you can enjoy one alcoholic beverage
[SPEAKER_04]: without getting any sort of intoxication,
but every time you consume cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's to get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, well, sort of, but you can
also consume a small amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and get no high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it consuming large amounts of
cannabis products when I'm consuming
[SPEAKER_04]: straight CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just like, that's medical consumers
like you and me, like one or two high THC
[SPEAKER_04]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still no intoxication.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just all sort of painkill.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to make that argument is the most
people don't go to the bar for more than
[SPEAKER_04]: one drink or to feel some sort of ease,
relief of stress or blow off some steam or
[SPEAKER_04]: get a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been aware of the phrase three
martini lunch since I was like five.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a nonsense argument,
but I hear it day after day from elected
[SPEAKER_04]: officials, people in suits, people whose
opinions being printed in the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's unfair.
[SPEAKER_05]: How come you guys have somewhere to hang
out and congregate and drink one drink and
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have somewhere to hang out and
congregate and take one dab?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same damn thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to continue because there's one
more paragraph.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says at the end of his testimony,
Corey made a show of delivering the icy
[SPEAKER_05]: attorney, a draft lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He intends to file as soon as the mayor
signs the club ban ordinance on behalf of
[SPEAKER_05]: nine clubs and 14 individuals who own or
operate those clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: The complaint asks for the ordinance to be
struck down for violating plaintiff's
[SPEAKER_05]: rights of association, freedom of speech
and due process under the U S
[SPEAKER_05]: constitution, as well as their right to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of
[SPEAKER_05]: happiness, religious freedom and rights.
[SPEAKER_05]: A medical and personal use of marijuana
under Colorado constitution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor night took exception to the
claim that council has no right to ban
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will talk about that in court.
[SPEAKER_05]: Corey said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with this happened, they had four days
to draft the new rules and have the city
[SPEAKER_05]: attorney sign them is what I was told.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that should have happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the day for that signing would be
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as soon as that was signed,
is this story still developing as soon as
[SPEAKER_05]: the paper was signed is when the law suit
went into.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the 27th is when the paper will be
signed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when the lawsuit will kick in
is what I think I was told.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to watch this one
play out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure will.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want these clubs to get closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be able to go hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like we have rules for them down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just none of them are open because
essentially the rules mean it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be a huge upfront investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rules also mean they've got to
make that investment back.
[SPEAKER_04]: With a quarter profit apiece on like
prepackaged bags of chips and bottled
[SPEAKER_04]: water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those buildings are expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That part of most parts of Colorado
Springs right now are really expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got one more news article I want
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I want to mention something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody was reading a CBD article from
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody was sharing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The article was a hoax, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got all this riled up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking at it a little further and
that actual article was a hoax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety nine percent of it's a hoax.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's based on a truth, though,
like the FDA did set out warning letters
[SPEAKER_04]: to different CBD companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was my understanding that a lot of
them were the ones you and me were warning
[SPEAKER_04]: people about a couple of months back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Chinese nonsense companies that are
like two drops of this will cure your
[SPEAKER_04]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they test it and it's pure
codfish oil or some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I read an article on Facebook that
was saying that the FDA sent out a letter
[SPEAKER_05]: saying that all CBD products were banned
because it was now FDA regulated.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a hoax.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys saw that, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may come down the pipeline in the
future.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of this time, that was a hoax.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was click bait.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were trying to get you a click.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bought the bait.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I read it, I was like, this isn't
written well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to do some research.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a few episodes ago, continuingly,
we've been talking about a raid that
[SPEAKER_05]: happened in San Ana, California,
when some police officers raided a
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary that was open and full of
customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know which raid we're talking
about, hit pause real quick and Google
[SPEAKER_04]: Santa Ana police dispensary raid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that should bring the video right up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these cops were caught on camera
destroying this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: They ate what I thought was edibles on
camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this article covers a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tries to back them up a little bit on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say that they were eating edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This article kind of defends them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if the headline calls it the
pot-eating video, we can go ahead and be
[SPEAKER_04]: solid on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looked like they were eating
edibles in the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would still say those were edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was edible something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, they were the most fun snacks ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: This article is from the OC Weekly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn,
[SPEAKER_05]: that sentence was hard for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: The video first posted by OC Weekly last
June clearly showed officers passing
[SPEAKER_05]: around candy bars, joking about feeling
lightheaded and tossing darts after
[SPEAKER_05]: finishing their Scooby snack.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shocking footage of the sky high cops
went viral, leading to nationwide and
[SPEAKER_05]: international news reports.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet in its official announcement of the
misdemeanor charges filed today,
[SPEAKER_05]: the OCDA claims there is no evidence that
any of the Santa Ana Police Department
[SPEAKER_05]: officers shown in the video consumed
marijuana products during the raid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, they're being prosecuted for
causing intentional damage to legally
[SPEAKER_05]: disabled video cameras and eating detour
sample protein bars and Mr. Thinster
[SPEAKER_05]: cookies that were not marijuana-laced
products on sale at the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_05]: but were simply snacks available to staff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the word laced.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate the word laced too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically the good news is charges
were filed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bad news is because the video footage
is so grainy, the cops are claiming that
[SPEAKER_04]: what they were consuming were non-infused
products that the store had on hand for
[SPEAKER_04]: staff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of their charges, if I remember
correctly, is stealing those food items.
[SPEAKER_05]: The officers named in the OCDA
announcement as facing petty theft charges
[SPEAKER_05]: for eating the supposedly non-pot-laced
candy bars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I wanna stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say laced.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you put it in there on purpose and it's
being sold as, laced is hiding it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Laced is when you put some, when you take
a joint and you put some special sprinkles
[SPEAKER_05]: in there and you don't tell somebody and
they smoke it and like, yo, I'm fucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, yeah, it was laced.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's laced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Infused is what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're purposely putting this product in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lacing only happens in crazy people's
minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mostly a myth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely not what dispensaries do
to get their customers stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lacing doesn't happen in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: So non-pot-infused candy bars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: The officer's name in the OCDA
announcement is facing petty theft charges
[SPEAKER_05]: for eating the supposedly non-pot-infused
candy bars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Brandon Matthew, do we wanna read all
their names?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't wanna glorify them by reading
their names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another officer also faces an additional
count of vandalism for damaging the
[SPEAKER_05]: disabled video cameras and allegedly
smashing their lenses into the corner of a
[SPEAKER_05]: display case and cash register.
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy's an extra dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gets an extra charge.
[SPEAKER_05]: The three defendants are accused of
consuming the food items and sharing the
[SPEAKER_05]: protein bars with other SAPD personnel,
the press release states.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before leaving the premises at the
conclusion of the search warrant,
[SPEAKER_05]: two officers, I can't even say one of
their names, are accused of taking extra
[SPEAKER_05]: cookies with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The DA's office says it concluded a
thorough investigation of the incident,
[SPEAKER_05]: including the careful review of more than
16 hours of unedited video surveillance
[SPEAKER_05]: footage with cooperation of the SAPD.
[SPEAKER_05]: While other SAPD personnel, like the bald
cop, seen in the video saying he felt
[SPEAKER_05]: lightheaded after eating one of them,
ate some protein bars, there is
[SPEAKER_05]: insufficient evidence, sorry, I'm
stuttering on this one, there is
[SPEAKER_05]: insufficient evidence that they knew the
food items belonged to the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_05]: not their fellow officers, the release
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also no evidence that any SAPD
personnel consumed any edible marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: items available at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's- They expect us to believe
this shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the article even says, right,
no evidence whatsoever other than the fact
[SPEAKER_05]: that the cops were at a pot shop eating
candy bars and acting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is then left with the obvious
conclusion that these poor officers are so
[SPEAKER_05]: underpaid that they have no choice but to
munch down on pilfered protein bars while
[SPEAKER_05]: on duty.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes so much more sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, like they broke in, they smashed
everything, and they were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, Chaz brought cookies to their
military-style raid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: They jumped out of their SWAT car and
their SWAT gear, and they fucking bang
[SPEAKER_04]: open and unlock fucking door by kicking it
the wrong way a bunch, screaming,
[SPEAKER_04]: yelling at everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, what, the dude in the
back had cookies?
[SPEAKER_04]: Motherfucker, how high are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: How little attention do they have?
[SPEAKER_04]: They think we're paying.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sit there in the video and talk about
how they're all woozy from eating the
[SPEAKER_04]: protein bars they stole.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you see the video and then you look
at these charges and it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, the rest of that was just legal,
common procedure.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that common?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it also says, if convicted on all
counts, the trio of uninformed snack
[SPEAKER_05]: fiends faces between six months and one
year in jail plus fines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they do go to court, they do get a
jury.
[SPEAKER_05]: The jury is going to watch this video and
convict them if they get real people on
[SPEAKER_05]: the jury, if they don't fucking fix that
jury up real nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want to see what happens to
these guys if they go to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cops don't do well in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I've seen plenty of
movies to know that cops are not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: do well in jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: The behavior is so egregious, and we've
seen it for so long in this community.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a raid for a dispensary or
whatnot, and they come back the day after
[SPEAKER_04]: the raid with video cameras and
everything's broken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everything, everything, the walls,
the lights, the light bulbs, the
[SPEAKER_04]: doorknobs, everything's destroyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The carpet's ripped up, electrical
wiring's destroyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, well, you were serving a
search warrant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a display of aggression.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just came in, destroyed everything in
baths.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't even arrest anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: No charges were filed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just came in, took everything,
destroyed everything that isn't worth
[SPEAKER_04]: taking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's not law enforcement,
that's piracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's terrorism.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the public's cool with it
because they're doing it to the stoners.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stoners that worked hard to open a
business and try to help and contribute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God there hasn't been a lot of these
raids in Colorado, but I see them
[SPEAKER_04]: regularly in other states where a business
has invested years and millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_04]: to get up running, start getting
successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the cops come in, destroy
everything, take everything worth money
[SPEAKER_04]: and bounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a year later, no one's been charged
with anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the store is back up and running
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, from my perspective, that's why
they don't want us to use banks because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's more paperwork to seize a bank
account than to just snatch the saves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hadn't thought about it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that sounds accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more cash in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can just come get it and buy
themselves more armored vehicles and
[SPEAKER_05]: Humvees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: These aren't necessarily the opinions of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the opinions of Mike himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might support your statements,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I bring you on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I don't mind waiting for hours
in line to vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because I started paying attention
and the more I paid attention,
[SPEAKER_04]: the more it caught my attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more I saw, the more pissed I got.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start reading the news in your area,
folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, you should just do mic drops.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should just take that mic right out of
the stand to start dropping it
[SPEAKER_05]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had enough gear problems without me
breaking the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of gear problems, let me see
how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing about 33 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't looked.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are at 44 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my friend 44.
[SPEAKER_05]: 44 and 2 is your new name, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast
lately, but you've earned the new name of
[SPEAKER_05]: 44 and 2.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one was that ticket and number two
was your recent adventure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 44 and 2 is your new name, tough guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's all the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got for you today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I had to make it a late night for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to, my man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Late nights to get these shows in are the
name of the game right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys enjoy it because we work
pretty hard to bring a good one to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to try to come up with some
smart ass to say, but I didn't have shit
[SPEAKER_05]: for you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Too many dabs to be a smart ass at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a lot to say here at the end
of the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any sponsors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you check out the secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence and until
next time, take a fat dab and give your
[SPEAKER_05]: mama hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I met a girl this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was love at first sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I met a girl this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was beauty to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked her where she from.
[SPEAKER_01]: She tell me in the topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: She asked me what's my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell her I am Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said girl, tell me what's your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she tell me that her name is Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl, smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smile for me, Jamaica.

[SPEAKER_01]: But she tell me say she tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tired of the exploits and the liars.
[SPEAKER_01]: She give them reggae, give them beaches,
give them flowers and the ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: All she got is abuse in return.
