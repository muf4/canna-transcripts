[SPEAKER_00]: description to make it nice and easy for
all of my friends maybe you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you're driving maybe you've got your
hands full right now keep yourself safe
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get yourself in trouble these are a
few things that didn't qualify for a full
[SPEAKER_00]: show but should be mentioned on a show so
here are a few of these small notes
[SPEAKER_00]: compiled into a Thursday episode without
too much more rambling let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the first ones on the list it says
quarantine incoming clones that's right
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about clones on a previous
episode I've talked about sharing clones
[SPEAKER_00]: with your friends it's never a bad idea to
get clones from friends or get maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: get them from a dispensary however you get
them it's always fun to get new genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you do that it is very important it
is very critical that we quarantine these
[SPEAKER_00]: clones they are coming into our garden
they're being introduced to your grow they
[SPEAKER_00]: can contaminate your entire grow with
whatever problems they've got they come
[SPEAKER_00]: with free bugs they come with free mildew
they come with all kinds of free funk that
[SPEAKER_00]: you did not expect so as a responsible
grower as a responsible farmer it is your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility and your job to quarantine
that incoming clone if you get a new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: a little baby plant I don't care how big
it is how small it is I don't care how
[SPEAKER_00]: much you trust that other person if you
get a plant quarantine it treat it like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got a problem treat it with the
fungicide treat it with the pesticide do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your routine is to make sure that
it does not have problems I treat things
[SPEAKER_00]: in a certain way because I work in a
commercial grow environment I am exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to a lot of things I expose those
commercial grows to a lot of things I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get a clone from a friend that's got
mites on it and then take it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow and contaminate one of
those multi-million dollar commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities so when I get a clone the first
thing I do is I treat it with pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to tell you what I use
because I will get flack for it I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback all I have to do is say the word
pesticide on the show and people start
[SPEAKER_00]: messaging me and leaving poor comments so
pesticide there you go but it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with appropriate pesticides
appropriate fungicides to ensure that I do
[SPEAKER_00]: not get any bugs or problems from an
incoming clone I don't want bonuses with
[SPEAKER_00]: my clones I want genetics not bugs not
mildews not issues not problems not shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did not expect so it's my
responsibility to put that clone in
[SPEAKER_00]: another area I've got a main grow space a
little further away from that main grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space I've got another small light where I
can house a couple of incoming plants it's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing major it's not an impressive grow
space but it will keep plants there for a
[SPEAKER_00]: week and it will keep them alive that way
I don't have to introduce them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: general population get everybody in
general population sick I'm sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand with the the pandemic we just
went through you can get everybody sick
[SPEAKER_00]: with just one contaminated infected person
the plants work the same damn way so when
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are coming into the grow from a
friend let's quarantine them for seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: ten days if you can at least five to seven
days keep them away from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants treat them with the appropriate
pesticide fungicide maybe you're gonna put
[SPEAKER_00]: predator mites on them maybe you're gonna
put it in a really hot room and heat up
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature to get rid of the bug eggs
I don't know your approach but have a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy to make sure that those bugs are
gone before you get to the main grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if I brought just a clone home and
it had mites on it I'd took it into my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space then I went to do a
consultation at a commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and they got my spider mites how
bad of a dick would I be they probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't even know that the mites came
from me but I would know and then I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: be mad at the person that gave me spider
mites it is my responsibility to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: myself everybody says I don't have mites
dude I don't have mold I don't have thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything get a clone from
them that's how you find out that they do
[SPEAKER_00]: have spider mites they do have thrips so I
am NOT perfect you guys why am I talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about this because guess what I got a
clone that I thought I quarantined it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly I thought I did the appropriate
measures but it had some ferocious fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites on it so I ended up dealing
with a little bit of a spider mite battle
[SPEAKER_00]: not a big deal I'm an experienced gardener
I know what I'm doing but I had to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the big two commercial grows where I've
been recently and say hey I had spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites and it's like going to somebody and
saying like fucking hey I had a fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: STD test and you might want to get tested
too it's the same fucking feeling so I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to these grows and say hey guys I
had mites in my garden dude you might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to up your game or do some extra shit I
didn't take plants to their grill but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been there I'm fucking I'm sure I carry a
spider mite on me you know I came from one
[SPEAKER_00]: grow to the other the mites are
microscopic one could have been on my
[SPEAKER_00]: pants on my shirt someone's gonna say
they're in your dreads I'm waiting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: joke to come already nothing new but yes
it's very likely I carried a spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: to these commercial grows luckily we were
very diligent with our pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: system at those commercial grows we do
things when we walk in we suit up at one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the places we actually wear Tyvek suits
got my hair in a bun and in a hat with
[SPEAKER_00]: like a hairnet thing over it that place is
fairly well protected the other place is
[SPEAKER_00]: so pesticide crazy and they're really
clean about everything I don't think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get any bug problems but it is
possible so I went there and I said hey
[SPEAKER_00]: guys guess what I had spider mites so you
might too and really it's the same feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: as giving a fucking negative STD result
like you got to call people and be like
[SPEAKER_00]: hey you might want to go to the doctor but
again it was my responsibility just like
[SPEAKER_00]: an STD test it was my responsibility to
make sure my shit was safe just like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: your responsibility all right I said I
wasn't gonna go on too long about one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I think we went long enough about
quarantine your incoming clones treat them
[SPEAKER_00]: the day you get that clone treat it with
the pesticide put it in a room turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: light off for an hour treat it with the
pesticide whatever you prefer however you
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer to do it treat it with something
that's gonna ensure you that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a problem maybe this plant is an
incoming mother plant maybe you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: even going to consume this plant maybe
this is just the one that's coming in you
[SPEAKER_00]: can spray that one with fucking anything
you choose if you're not going to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: it just blast it with something crazy put
it in the grow let it grow take a few
[SPEAKER_00]: clones out of it I know people are gonna
say half-life and that good stuff but
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you've got to do what you have
got to do if your life and your your goals
[SPEAKER_00]: and your business depend on it you may
have to do some things just if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna consume that plant you can treat it
with whatever down the line people are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say that pesticide is in there but
we will clone it it will work itself out
[SPEAKER_00]: over time we just need to get rid of that
bug to get this plant into the grow so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can work with it to save it to make it
acceptable so treat that plant however you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel necessary but beware incoming clones
especially from a dispensary grow that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have bugs on it dude not to point
fingers at the dispensaries it's just hard
[SPEAKER_00]: it's such a big facility once you get a
pest outbreak it becomes challenging so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you got the clone from the dispensary
please do quarantine it treat it treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: the day you get it then treat it like
three to five maybe seven days later treat
[SPEAKER_00]: it again then pull a leaf off of it look
at it under a microscope under a
[SPEAKER_00]: magnifying glass do you see you may see
some dead eggs you may see some shit left
[SPEAKER_00]: on there from before but do you see
anything moving anything viable anything
[SPEAKER_00]: alive anything that will be a problem or a
threat if so leave that fucker in
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine and keep treating it until the
problem is gone if it's a small plant you
[SPEAKER_00]: can dunk it I've showed you in previous
episodes how to do a dunk that dunk we did
[SPEAKER_00]: right before we popped the clones into the
the clone gel you can hold the plant so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the plant coming out of a cup
or a small pot I've got big hands I can
[SPEAKER_00]: put my hand over the top of the pot and
basically hold most of the soil in and
[SPEAKER_00]: have the stick coming out from between my
fingers so that my hand is working like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lid to cover the soil the stem of the
plant still sticks up between my fingers I
[SPEAKER_00]: just flip the plant upside down and gently
dunk it into the pesticide give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of swooshes a couple of plunges
take it out let it dry off if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: rinse it with clean water after that that
is acceptable or spray it down with clean
[SPEAKER_00]: water this plant should be big enough and
safe enough to where it's not gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: any photo toxicity oh yeah in a previous
episode I did say the word phytotoxicity I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have any notes and I was talking
fast I said the wrong word you're correct
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the updates sometimes I'm
gonna say the wrong shit you talk for
[SPEAKER_00]: countless hours by yourself and don't say
anything wrong anyway give that plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: dunk give it a rinse if you want don't put
it under light for several hours let that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide work its thing let it kind of
dry off under there then when it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: put the light back on check the plants
make sure there's no bugs alright for a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick fucking chatter on that one I went
for a long time let's see we've been going
[SPEAKER_00]: for we got plenty of time alright I also
saw somebody on social media say that the
[SPEAKER_00]: rec market was looking sad in Colorado
that the medical marijuana is much better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the recreational cannabis and I just
had to chime in with a small correction I
[SPEAKER_00]: asked them what is the difference between
the recreational cannabis and the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and they couldn't tell me any
difference in the actual plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers they kept saying that the taxes
were too high and that none of their
[SPEAKER_00]: statements supported the statement that
the product was better or that there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference and that's because I work in
recreational and commercial grows I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation manager for a facility that on
one side of the building one side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parking lot we had a recreational grow on
the other side we had a medical grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were grown the exact same way we
modeled the two grows after each other to
[SPEAKER_00]: where we could have standard operating
procedures that worked in both buildings
[SPEAKER_00]: so we didn't have to train new growers
like hey we grow the medical weed this way
[SPEAKER_00]: and we grow the rec weed this way no we
grow it all the best we fucking can we had
[SPEAKER_00]: the same well let me be honest with you in
one building we had better shit because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a newer building and we learned a lot
but that was just timing that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking because of it was the future like
the next podcast studio will be better
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will be better there'll be new
shit we'll have learned something but it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be mirrored after this just upgraded
so honestly it was a little bit different
[SPEAKER_00]: just because technology but then the next
grow will be a little bit better but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all the same shit in both facilities
we've got the same lighting the same HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: system the same nutrients it is the same
clones we were so you're allowed to enter
[SPEAKER_00]: clones into your system at a certain time
when your facility is new you can get them
[SPEAKER_00]: from certain sources we were able to get
the same clones sourced for the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: or for the recreational facility as we did
the medical so we've got pick a strain I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just gonna say a rise we got a rise at the
medical and a rise at the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: facility same clone same cut same plant
same breeder shout it to a rise by the way
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rocking the Arise t-shirt today grab
your Arise t-shirt at iriegenetics.com
[SPEAKER_00]: click on the irie store it'll get you
right there if you were signed up for the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter you did get a fatty coupon code
that'll help you out but so we got a rise
[SPEAKER_00]: in the recreational and a rise in the
medical grow guess what I feed them both
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same nutrients I feed them the
same day the same fucking thing they get
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed the exact same pesticides they get
sprayed the same foliar feeds they get
[SPEAKER_00]: popped and twisted and defoliated the same
then guess what here is something that may
[SPEAKER_00]: blow your mind they are watered and fed by
this same grotex that's right we have two
[SPEAKER_00]: buildings across the street from each
other these guys work over here from
[SPEAKER_00]: morning till lunch then they travel across
the way and then from lunch to the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day they work on the other side the
same dudes are watering the same plants
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the same popping and twisting and
lollipopping the same techs are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: the recreational and the medical marijuana
plants I don't like the word marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: plants it didn't feel good recreational
cannabis when I say medical marijuana it
[SPEAKER_00]: flows it works but recreational I'm not
gonna say a recreational marijuana again
[SPEAKER_00]: that was weird you guys I'm good in stone
add some fatty dabs today shout out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty business dabs from green dot labs I
enjoy that shit um so it's the same grotex
[SPEAKER_00]: then guess what at the end it is the same
harvest crew the same trimmers trim the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational and the medical herb the same
people they just move from building to
[SPEAKER_00]: building we can't move the product because
technically legally license wise the
[SPEAKER_00]: product has to stay where it is but the
team can move they're they're mobile
[SPEAKER_00]: they're fucking they just walk across the
parking lot so sometimes we start the day
[SPEAKER_00]: with like grotech a and grotech b you're
in building one grotech c and grotech g
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in building two and then trim crew
we need you over here and that's how the
[SPEAKER_00]: day starts we just assign people to rooms
and buildings and they go where they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to go and they get comfortable and they do
the day in that building or we'll do half
[SPEAKER_00]: of it over here half of it over here being
the lead guy I do fucking half of it in
[SPEAKER_00]: this building half of it in this building
then the other half in the office and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that's three halves of a day but you
be the manager and you'll know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck I mean all right so the recreational
and the commercial are the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing now here's something I want to talk
about since we're talking about growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial environment commercial
cultivators I'm going to kind of direct
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this podcast at you right now the
biggest part of being on a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation team is knowing your role in
the team and understanding your part on
[SPEAKER_00]: the team does the lead grower need you to
do a certain thing learn that part and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking do that part or do we need you to
be the jack of all trades where I can rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on you for if this guy calls off or if
that guy calls off can you cover their job
[SPEAKER_00]: find your role in the team understand that
there is a big picture understand that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not like this one detail that we've
got to do but that one detail is what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes these other three things fucking
possible so just understand your role
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that there is a bigger picture
understand that yeah you've got some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: on your mind and your day and your things
but there is a big picture in this
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facility the lead cultivator
or a term that I'm going to touch on in a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute the master grower knows what is
going on somebody in the building has got
[SPEAKER_00]: a map and unless you're the one with the
map that knows how to get from point A to
[SPEAKER_00]: point B and you know the goal and you've
spoken to everybody on the team just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of find your spot and understand your role
on the team everybody is just as important
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking tremors are just as important
as the grow techs are just as important as
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking tech leads are just as
important as the master grower are just as
[SPEAKER_00]: important as the consultant are just as
important as the investors are just as
[SPEAKER_00]: important as the owners because without
all of them the shit does not work if the
[SPEAKER_00]: owner doesn't own it and pay all the
people down the line the shit doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen but if the tremors don't trim the
herb there's no fucking product to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking had and everybody down the line
has to do their part so figure out under
[SPEAKER_00]: try to understand the bigger picture in
the cultivation facility it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sitting there trimming weed so that
the owner can drive a Porsche the owners
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot on the fucking line the owner
had to establish money to acquire licenses
[SPEAKER_00]: and buildings and they're giving you a job
so understand how the whole dynamic of
[SPEAKER_00]: that building it's not just you listening
to 311 all day fucking trim an herb or you
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkling water on these plants or you
being tortured because you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate all day it's a big big picture
in there so be part of the team understand
[SPEAKER_00]: your position and play your part fucking
roll really really well watch those videos
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube where the people from other
cultures can grab a fruit off the tree and
[SPEAKER_00]: cut it into the shape of a butterfly and
season it and fucking serve it to you in
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 seconds and do 30 of them without
taking a break get your job like that your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow team will love you your grow lead the
master grower will notice it and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate you that stuff gets mentioned
to the investors gets mentioned to the
[SPEAKER_00]: owners then guess what when it's bonus
time when it's raise time guess who gets
[SPEAKER_00]: the bonuses and raises then when I leave
that facility because I've had enough
[SPEAKER_00]: because I just get ADD and I get bored I
like to go in and get a facility run in
[SPEAKER_00]: and then have it smooth and then somebody
will call and they'll say hey my girl was
[SPEAKER_00]: falling apart can you come help and I'll
go I'm gonna go there now and then guess
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's time for the person that was
shining the most when I was there I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend they take over my position and
now they get to be the grow lead or the
[SPEAKER_00]: master grower you guys I don't like the
term master grower as much as you I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna save that for the end but let's jump
up to this term so you guys find your find
[SPEAKER_00]: your role on the team a know is a team
know your spot and the team understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is a big team we're not just going
to work every day to do a fucking job
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's got a role every player is
important so show up and be important
[SPEAKER_00]: today show up and be important shine today
at work because there are a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that want your job I've got statistics
just stacks of applications of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: want your job so crush it get out there
and do it now let's talk about this silly
[SPEAKER_00]: word master grower when you're the word
master grower you automatically cringe
[SPEAKER_00]: right social media goes crazy relax bro
chill out nobody thinks they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking ninja master in the grow when you
work at the brewery the term is master
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer but nobody's getting uptight over
the master brewer we did not assign
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves the fucking role master grower
it's on the application it's a fucking job
[SPEAKER_00]: title we're not trying to say I'm the
master I don't have a fucking black belt
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crown no I'm the fucking one in
charge of the fucking grow there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the grow they can have a little
say in some opinions but when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to it I'm the fucking captain now and
we're doing what I say that's all the term
[SPEAKER_00]: master grower means don't get it twisted
don't think that it makes me think I'm the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking master no I'm the fucking boss
it's just the way of saying motherfucker
[SPEAKER_00]: that is in charge that's a master grower
means so quit fucking giving people shit
[SPEAKER_00]: about it quit being a crybaby about it
that's my two cents on the phrase master
[SPEAKER_00]: grower it's on the fucking application
it's on the job title that's all it is all
[SPEAKER_00]: right you don't give other people weird
shit for their fucking job title
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the master brewer no you don't
you know fucking chill out all right
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my wrap on that now let's see the
part where I was saying fill your role the
[SPEAKER_00]: best you can and show up and kick ass at
work today that part also applies to a
[SPEAKER_00]: small personal grow what is your goal know
your goal do you have a plan and a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy for your personal grow why not
what are you doing tomorrow what needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be done the next day do you know what
needs to be done in that are you just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of flying by the seat of your pants hoping
that you get some good product at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: the more time the more love the more
energy you put into that grow the more it
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to show you sure you can fucking
grow some weed anybody I hear people say
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody can put some seeds and some dirt
and pour some water on it and grow some
[SPEAKER_00]: weed sure you could anybody could also
paint a fucking painting you get some
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas and some paint and just fucking
splattered on there right sure does
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody give a shit is it interest in
anybody is it quality are you even proud
[SPEAKER_00]: of it probably not but if you took your
time took some effort put some energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: it put some thought and some heart into it
even if your painting looks like shit in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end everybody else you can be proud of
it because you put pride into it your
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers your ganja garden your herb your
medicine is the same exact way spend some
[SPEAKER_00]: time in there love it care for it do some
research have a plan again though don't go
[SPEAKER_00]: over there in there and fucking just over
love it sometimes you just got to get out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and let it do its thing but you
wouldn't take a puppy home and not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: leash a collar a puppy bowl like a dog
bowl a fucking water bowl maybe a puppy
[SPEAKER_00]: bed you better have some pee pads and some
fucking napkins or something to clean up
[SPEAKER_00]: all this dog piss and shit you're gonna
have to deal with you kind of prepare you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't bring a baby home without a fucking
bassinet and a blanket and a crib at least
[SPEAKER_00]: most of us don't a lot of us maybe you
fucking did and sorry if I'm calling you
[SPEAKER_00]: out but my point is if you've got cannabis
plants be fucking prepared you have got
[SPEAKER_00]: pets you've got plants you've got a
project you've spent money on the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil the grow space you have built
some stuff you care about it enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an environment for it let's put some
thought into it let's understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have a goal do you know your goal
do you know your strategy do you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing or are you coming to social
media every Monday saying what should I
[SPEAKER_00]: have done to my plants what is going on
because that's gonna set you up for a
[SPEAKER_00]: failure I love social media I love the
internet I'm on the internet teaching you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grow but everybody thinks they know
how to grow and they don't know your
[SPEAKER_00]: situation they don't know what you're
doing and they think their way is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: and the only way as a experienced longtime
cultivator I know that there are thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of ways to skin this fucking cat we can
grow cannabis on the moon we can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in dirt we can grow cannabis in
soilless mixes cocoa we don't even need
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt you can suspend that shit and water
and grow it all of those ways are right
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all absolutely correct you can top
it you can film it you can pop it you can
[SPEAKER_00]: twist it or you can leave it the fuck
alone and guess what all of those ways are
[SPEAKER_00]: correct so when you go to the internet and
somebody says you have to do this you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to do shit you have to have fun
in there and you have to grow it and not
[SPEAKER_00]: burn the place down that's fucking
basically all you have to do if the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: die or the place burns down you fucked up
and failed if you're happy with your
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome you did it right but if you have a
strategy and you know what you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a book and a goal and some sort of
ideas you'll have a much more successful
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome so set a strategy set a goal read
some books read about like week one this
[SPEAKER_00]: is what I should expect when you're gonna
have a baby they sell you that book what
[SPEAKER_00]: to expect when you're expecting and it
tells you on week on month one expect this
[SPEAKER_00]: month to expect this and then it's like on
month nine you're gonna have a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: baby or month 10 the baby comes out then
you get this there are books for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: just like that and they'll tell you what
to expect every week and there's only nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks of flowers you've only got to read
nine weeks and it's about a page per week
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to figure that out so get a
book listen to some podcasts and know what
[SPEAKER_00]: to expect every week that's coming up that
way you can be prepared you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Facebook and say hey I kind of grow
weed 63 at Facebook net how do I do this
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're everybody on there is
gonna have fucking different opinions and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all gonna fuck up your garden for
you so read your books read a book have an
[SPEAKER_00]: educated fucking basis of doing what have
an educated yeah I know what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: say have an education have some sort of a
basis and understanding so you know why
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing what you're doing think about
what you're doing think about the outcome
[SPEAKER_00]: and have an education on why not just a
bunch of people on social media saying my
[SPEAKER_00]: uncle Bill tried this in 63 and it worked
or my friend Larry's cousin Bob says to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this read a book from an experienced grow
author that can fucking tell you how and
[SPEAKER_00]: why also don't be afraid to ask somebody
why when somebody says do this to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants say why they should have a reason
if they can't explain to you why they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what the fuck they're talking
about I can explain to you why everything
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you to do to the plants there's a
reason for it also have a goal without a
[SPEAKER_00]: goal there's no reason to do some shit so
I feel like I've been rambling for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time I said I wasn't gonna ramble too much
on one topic here I fucking lied to you on
[SPEAKER_00]: that part do you have a plan do you have a
strategy you are the lead grower in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow you're also the star employee are you
gonna be the fucking employee of the month
