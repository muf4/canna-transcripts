[SPEAKER_00]: To make it super easy for all of my
friends to support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize if you hear me struggling
to catch my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking a couple of fat dabs
before the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just smoked a nice buffet, a
smorgasbord, if you will, of great
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst those dabs was a mix, a combo of
the lemon Jeffrey and the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dab made my vision go weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my head feel funny in all the
right ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm over here struggling trying to
catch my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got someone sitting on my
chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit heavy to breathe over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get my shit together eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make a podcast out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for dealing with my wheezy voice
trying to catch my breath here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more thing to
cover before we get to the main topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do invite you to join Team Irie Genetics
and the Dude Grows Crew and the Irie Army
[SPEAKER_00]: and many other great cannabis breeders for
the DGC Growers Cup in Fort Collins on
[SPEAKER_00]: July 30th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Team Irie Genetics and many
other breeders, many members of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community, many members of the
Dude Grows Cup, the Dude Grows Crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Irie Army will be hanging out at
the DGC Growers Cup in Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do invite you to come hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to smoking a joint with
you, taking a dab with you, giving you a
[SPEAKER_00]: hug, giving you a fist bump, taking a
selfie with you, getting to know you,
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting you face to face if we've never
met before, and seeing your smiling face
[SPEAKER_00]: again if we've hung out before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to seeing you at the
Dude Grows Cup, so do please come hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find all of the info you need at
DudeGrows.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I have been teasing these
emails saying I've got an email portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not done any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question is not 100% cannabis
related, but I feel like I am qualified to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my friend Orville felt that I
was qualified because Orville asked me
[SPEAKER_00]: this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Orville.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, really simply,
how do you start a podcast I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question since I'm 754
podcasts in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got quite a nice follow ship here,
a listenership, a viewership, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've built a good community out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of good interaction here,
so I do feel like I may be qualified to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about starting a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting a podcast can be very difficult,
or it could be very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how you want to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that I hear people say about
their podcast is, they're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: it when, or once I get this ready,
I'm going to start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice is just start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is never going to be the perfect time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is never going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to have the perfect
time to start a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perfect time to start a podcast is
right now because if you put, in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, if you put too much production
into it, too much thought into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it too big of a production,
it puts too much pressure on you and it
[SPEAKER_00]: won't, it'll never meet your standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast, I've done 750 something
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them have been perfect,
but they've all come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all served their purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all viewable, listenable,
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all get a lot of good reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to be the perfect time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perfect time is now, since it's not
perfect, you'll capture the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the podcast is about,
there needs to be a moment that is
[SPEAKER_00]: captured.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know kind of what's going on in
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's going on in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's happening in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know small details about my life
because I share them here on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can capture the moment here with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't make it too perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done 754 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel any of them were perfect,
but all of them were perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't wait for the perfect episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait for the perfect time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capture the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I talked about making it hard or
making it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things about a podcast,
I guess, is you need an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the show about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to talk about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be something you're at least
passionate about, something you're
[SPEAKER_00]: educated about or curious about,
or something that people will want to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're asking this question,
you've probably already got an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are thinking about it, that means
that there needs to be that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to start it, there are
probably people out there that want to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll need equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take a lot to get your idea
from your brain to your mouth into a
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone and onto the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes a microphone, some sort of a
USB recording device and possibly some
[SPEAKER_00]: editing software and a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of that isn't even necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could record directly into your
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could open up a voice app into your
iPhone and talk into that and say what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to say and then send that file
directly to a website and have it posted
[SPEAKER_00]: to the internet as a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take a moment and edit that file
if you wanted, or you could just send it
[SPEAKER_00]: up raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called Live to Drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just talk and then don't even edit,
don't do anything to shine it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: send it right out to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Live to Drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be more critical,
this show is well edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I record simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I match the files together using Final Cut
Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I edit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make it look fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be as difficult or as simple as you
want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better the microphone, obviously the
better the quality of the sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using a Shure SM7B.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the top microphones
available for broadcasting, for
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really great mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it is not the cheapest mic on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many more, much more affordable
microphones available that will work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you as a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you can use your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a little handheld voice
recorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a good microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you get a SM7B, you need another
piece just to power the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Cloudlifter over here that
provides power for the microphone because
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs some sort of juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get as technical as you want to
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: This microphone does not plug into my
computer directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer is not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the MacBook or any sort of
Mac devices at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running into a Zoom PodTrack P4.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the SM7B into a Cloudlifter,
into the Zoom P4.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm capturing the audio file on the P4.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all you need if you want to do an
audio podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be more than enough to do an
audio podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm done, I would, if I were just to
do that, when I were done, I would take
[SPEAKER_00]: the file from the Zoom, dump it into a
computer and edit it from there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: post it to the website, the RSS feed,
however that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm doing, I'm doing another
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me confuse you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me overrun you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just letting you know kind of what I
do and giving you options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go SM7B to the Cloudlifter, to the Zoom
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the sound dialed in, in the Zoom
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use a headphone out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got headphone one comes to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headphone one comes to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headphone two is the small jack going
directly out into the input of the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a camera in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the Sony A73 is what I think
that one's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the front face of the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Camera one is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Camera two can eat my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing only works half the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm running it, the headphone directly
into the input, the mic input of the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting straight from the Zoom
device onto the same file.
[SPEAKER_00]: My file is synced up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My audio and video are synced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I make a mistake, I don't have to
go into Final Cut Pro and sync them
[SPEAKER_00]: manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I am recording here on the Zoom
P4 audio format just as a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this audio file on the camera does go
wrong, I've at least got the audio
[SPEAKER_00]: recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the video fails, I don't do a second
camera right now because camera two is
[SPEAKER_00]: really pissing me off to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made the file much larger to load
to YouTube and it took too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have a backup of the audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the audio fails, I've got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording it twice on two different
formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go microphone, cloud lifter,
USB device, then to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do a microphone that links,
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do a microphone that directly
links via USB to your computer and save a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of steps, but then you need the
computer to record all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch myself being distracted by the
graph on the computer and all the data
[SPEAKER_00]: that the computer gives me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to play with the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I end up staring into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of eliminated the computer
from my recording mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were only producing, if I were the
producer paying attention to the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: sound levels and there were multiple
people with headphones and mics,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have a computer in front of me so
I could monitor the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody got too far from the mic,
I could say, hey bro, can you lean into
[SPEAKER_00]: that mic so we could hear you?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm producing, recording, I'm doing it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking, I'm hosting, doing it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't have so many distractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the show about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it about boats and hoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it about cars and cars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it about coffee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it about weed and whiskey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it about growing dope?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it about playing guitar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it about sneakers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a sneaker podcast out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your show about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need a creative name.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the podcasts need a real cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you need a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your iPhone would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to get your voice into a digital
format.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's either a USB device, a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like again, I go from the mic to the cloud
lifter to a USB interface and that goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time that would go to a
computer and you'd record it onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer or a drive on the USB device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can edit it in software from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got to go to an RSS feed,
which you can create that using,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've built my own website and put my RSS
feed in my own website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier that way for me because
I've got the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, you don't have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to use an RSS hosting
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Libsyn is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Libsyn is short for Liberated Syndicate,
so it's just L-I-B-S-Y-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple other services out
there that would work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody pays me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get any advertising fees or any
sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Libsyn is a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you're going to need gear,
an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to need an RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be too specific about the
gear that you should buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of about your budget and what
works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to work at a guitar center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw plenty of people buy guitars for
their kids that were never going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: their kids excited about playing music
because no matter what you do to that
[SPEAKER_00]: guitar, it's going to sound like a fucking
box with strings on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a piece of wood with strings to make
kids think they got a guitar to dupe
[SPEAKER_00]: parents into giving guitar center $100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never going to work out well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kid's going to hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they would have spent $250 on a guitar,
they could have got a guitar that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking good every time they play it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kid would be playing guitar every day
and be excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get equipment that is not the cheapest
get something that inspires you to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that makes you sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also get equipment that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of buttons, a lot of
knobs, a lot of toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into podcasting, I don't know
your technical abilities or limitations or
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just politely saying get the gear
that works for your ability because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can definitely out gear yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it when I moved up from the video
format or the audio format to the video
[SPEAKER_00]: format.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I out geared myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer said, oh, you're going to put
videos into me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get a new computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a new computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized, oh, this is really
easy to edit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a 4K camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a 4K camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the computer was like, nope,
got to upgrade one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to upgrade again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a huge learning curve,
learning to sync two videos together and
[SPEAKER_00]: get the audio and everything right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the gear that is within your
technical abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't out gear yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that I see musicians,
podcasters, men.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to just fucking out gear
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we've made a couple of bucks this month
and we got into a new hobby, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee I'm going to buy something
fucking ridiculous to go with my new
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just want cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want cupcakes with fucking sprinkles if
I'm doing cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get an idea, get good equipment,
get an RSS feed, get equipment that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can afford, but is good equipment that is
not cheap equipment that inspires you to
[SPEAKER_00]: work, but is also not too confusing for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the hardest part for some people is
just sit down and fucking press road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Record.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a solo podcast, you've only got to
wait for you to get in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can record today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 6 40 PM as I record right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode I recorded, I think I
completed around three in the morning so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can record whenever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really weird schedule with my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fit in podcasts when I feel I've got to
be in the mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to be in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm tired, if I'm lazy, the podcast
won't be any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wait till I'm uppity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some kombucha in my blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can do a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're solo, sit down and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to wait for other people,
that is one of the hardest things about
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting is getting one, two or three
other people to join you for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless there's advertising money or some
sort of commitment on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to get people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hardest part is just go make an
outline for episode one, make an outline
[SPEAKER_00]: for episode two, make an outline for
episode three, hit record and bang out
[SPEAKER_00]: episode one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to, I wouldn't even do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Record episode zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, put on the cameras, put on the
microphones and just talk for 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then take notes as you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the guy on Mike one talks too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy on Mike three is too quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl on Mike four, we can barely hear
her because we got to turn up her
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the camera wasn't picking up the guest
in chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, just write down the things
you're noticing for episode zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody watch episode zero
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do and do not want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like episode one, just do episode one
and put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got documentation of where the
show was in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is nothing like what it was in
episode one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have come, I have come so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a totally different podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my approach, my delivery, my editing,
everything is way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am slightly embarrassed of episode
one, but also that's where we were at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a time capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could easily take it off the internet,
but why that's what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just press record, just go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part of starting a podcast is
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know so many people that have the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've drawn the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've built the RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the fucking $600 microphone
sitting on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got everything they've played
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done soundcheck, but they've never
sat down and said, hi, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it's going to be about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of growth and a
lot of progression through this time of
[SPEAKER_00]: developing this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that you're here from the
beginning all the way until the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever that may be, tell your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in this show,
we'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then start saying what you've got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple episodes are going to
feel fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come out terribly,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got infinite episodes to improve
and your audience will come along with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've listened to the show,
you are a Patreon contributor,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Patreon, a patron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the community that we have
developed along with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I post a YouTube video and somebody
doesn't like something I said in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: they attack me, I sit back and laugh
because all of my social media followers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my YouTube supporters, all of the
iry army, all of the podcast listeners,
[SPEAKER_00]: they roast the person who tried to bash me
and I don't even have to say anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the type of community that we have
built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all it took was consecutive reliable
episodes that are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, I don't record a
show that I'm not feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not feeling it, I just won't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make my own schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there is a timeline for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are deadlines and sometimes I
don't work until there's pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show comes out Monday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's fucking Wednesday night and
I'm like, Oh, I got to record right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get the show out and it's beautiful,
but love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a podcast about what you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, start talking, get it out there,
share that community, build the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next note on my paper here is
build an audience and interact with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a social media following that goes
along with your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do as much as you can to interact with the
people that make your show successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can do what you can do to make the
show great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can produce it, write it, edit it,
put it out there, spam it everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's up to the audience to make it
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to tell their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to find some sort of value in
that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So advertise the show, share it to your
community, interact with your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I interact, I try to interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many of you in one of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds egotistical or
whatever, but there's just one of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a thousand messages a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try you guys, I try, but do your best to
interact with your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to address you guys via Patreon
here, social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try, but I'm really spread thin lately
and, uh, it's, it's not going to ease up,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when things are busy, that means
business is successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it slows down, I start freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, advertise your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, find ways to advertise your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best, uh, find certain niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your podcast about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it underwater basket weaving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medieval, uh, shield making?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fucking tattoos and tattoos are cool
by themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: An audio podcast about tattoos would be
awkward though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, what is your podcast about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say your podcast is about tattoos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertise in a tattoo magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you want to do,
go where the tattoo people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: then find the fringe of where the tattoo
people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where also are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in pop culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the motorcycle world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the fashion world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the hair world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the barber shop, you could advertise
your tattoo podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about other ways to advertise and
get out of your bubble, but also include
[SPEAKER_00]: your bubble because you want your crowd to
be your crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get an idea, get some gear,
create an RSS feed, then press fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: record and start going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've said that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still hate editing my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, it bugs me to just sit there and listen
to me for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already said all this shit once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to listen to it again and
make sure I got it right, but I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get used to hearing your own
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll drive you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are going to like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been listening to you,
to you talk your whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press record, then put the show up on the
internet and wait, just let people
[SPEAKER_00]: respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then consistently and reliably put out
your episodes on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really important in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: My people know that Monday and Thursday,
there's a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the show isn't there, I get messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're relying on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll begin to manifest relationships
with your audience and you'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: reminiscing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start remembering people and they
start emailing you and messaging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get some gear, get an RSS feed,
press record, say what you've got to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: edit it to make it feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to post it up to the internet
and wait to see what the world says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the world bashes you,
don't be surprised because the internet is
[SPEAKER_00]: a big old hater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to a restaurant, how often do
you tell the staff, this food was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was what I ordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if something, one little thing was
wrong, you'll fucking make sure to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet is that times 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's happy, they'll go,
I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might click like on your video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're really lucky, come on
guys, click like for me, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if they loved the shit out of your
video, maybe they'll click like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really touch their lives,
maybe they'll subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you said one second of one word wrong,
watch your comments section because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way the internet works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So develop a thick skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have thick skin when it
comes to the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to touch on is
something called imposter syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere along the line of your
podcasting career, you will think to
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, why am I podcasting about my
chosen topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do I think I am?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I Weed Wizard of Oz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I Weed Jesus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I Cannabis Christ?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just some dude growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would anybody want to listen to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I remember, oh, I do this because
I'm fucking passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want other people to be able to grow as
good of herb as I can so they can medicate
[SPEAKER_00]: or recreate as comfortably and often as
I'm able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to cut people's cost of medication
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to improve the quality of their
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: My overall goal is to have people growing
better weed so we can all smoke better
[SPEAKER_00]: weed to improve the overall quality of all
of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember that and I go, that's why
you're doing the fucking podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what the internet says,
no matter what the trolls say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing what I'm setting out to do and I
know that I'm successful because you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are sending me messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sending me Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just sending me love and praise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imposter syndrome will kick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let imposter syndrome win.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kicks in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually around episode five or
episode 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start going, oh, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Push through the imposter syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing this because you are the one
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You chose to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you believe in, chose you to be
the spokesperson for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know what I believe and I call
myself Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the most I jaw has called me and
asks me politely to teach you guys how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't use this gift that I've got,
I've got the gift to read a paper and get
[SPEAKER_00]: some instructions and then go apply that
in my grow room and make the paper into
[SPEAKER_00]: useful data because what it says on paper
is often good theory, but in practice in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow room, it doesn't fucking work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The books are written by people who have
never grown the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've only talked about it and read
about it and been to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never been in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in the grow room and I'm able to
take my reading and my hands on and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: spit it back out in a way that most people
can enjoy and absorb and learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't do that, if I didn't put that
gift back out to the world, I feel it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be disrespectful to whatever you
believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not judgmental on what you believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just call it by a different name,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you believe in gave us both this
desire to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do it, put it out there for the people,
do it from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say grow from your heart,
breed with love, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast from your heart, speak with love,
get that message out there and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do another message in this
show, but the message I've got is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very long and I feel like I rambled for
long enough about how to start a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be it for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Orville, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I inspired somebody out there to
start a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any follow-up questions,
if you've got any corrections,
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns, or if you need more info,

your mom a hug for me.

you next time.
