[SPEAKER_01]: fun part of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that is the question and answer
portion of the show This is how people get
[SPEAKER_01]: free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course at the start of the show I said
we're going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get those free seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: My website is irygenetics.com at the top
of that website There is a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it says grow questions You're gonna
figure it out when you get there click on
[SPEAKER_01]: that tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to send me a grow question If I
read your grow question here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast I will send you a coupon code for
free seeds from iry direct.com Today's
[SPEAKER_01]: first question came from somebody who
wants to be called Cody big shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: my new friend Cody Cody is asking a
question that pops up quite often in this
[SPEAKER_01]: business this industry this community This
question is sent to me quite often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to let this one fire me up too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to answer this maybe twice a year
because the people do ask this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one drives me a little bit crazy I
used to do pet peeves on the show This is
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a pet peeve of mine But I'm going
to make clarity out of this the question
[SPEAKER_01]: from Cody and Cody make sure you check
your inbox my dude because you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds also
check your spam because a lot of email
[SPEAKER_01]: services think that my gift cards are spam
for some reason check your spam you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway the question goes like this it says
howdy sir howdy sir it says I enjoy your
[SPEAKER_01]: show and the way you explain things well
thank you I appreciate that it says you
[SPEAKER_01]: make it easier to digest that's part of my
goal I am passionately curious and I love
[SPEAKER_01]: learning but for some reason I hated
school I hated going at that teachers slow
[SPEAKER_01]: boring fucking pace I hated learning the
same shit over and over for four weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: when I learned it a week ago so I try to
make it to where you guys are having fun I
[SPEAKER_01]: try to tell a joke every now and then I
try to get straight to the point and tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you what you need to know but I also try
to tell you in multiple ways because
[SPEAKER_01]: people learn in different ways some are
visual learners some people have to touch
[SPEAKER_01]: things I have a way that I can kind of
draw a picture of shit with my words and
[SPEAKER_01]: show you how to do it some people learn in
different ways and I'm trying to get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody get that info out and not
overload you so thank you for noticing
[SPEAKER_01]: that I make it easier to digest I do
appreciate that I also don't try to
[SPEAKER_01]: overload you some people will be like the
answer is nitrogen but then also
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and potassium and the answer
nitrogen would have gotten you there I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't need to overload you with shit I
try to be conscious of that it goes on
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot going on here it says I've
never been able to find a real answer on
[SPEAKER_01]: this question let's say you have a plant
that is a 10-week flower does that 10
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks start as soon as I switch to 1212 or
does it start after stretch and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: the puff balls thank you for your time
have a great day all right so I jumped
[SPEAKER_01]: right into the question part there the
question came up the question is if I have
[SPEAKER_01]: a 10-week flowering strain does that 10
weeks start the day I switched to 1212 or
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not even going to read the or
because why or why are we putting a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking algebra equation to this when you
are growing cannabis plants day one of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower begins the day you change the timer
to 1212 that is day one of flower you just
[SPEAKER_01]: initiated the flowering cycle you just
change that timer that is day one no ifs
[SPEAKER_01]: and buts questions substitutes what ifs
how comes that is it that is day one you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't wait until some other shit happens
you don't wait until you start to see this
[SPEAKER_01]: person said puff balls or pistols do not
wait for that that is not day one day one
[SPEAKER_01]: was the day you flipped the timer I didn't
write on the package 70 days minus two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks plus three days plus four days from
when you last water I didn't do any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that on there it says 70 days of flower so
when I wrote 70 days on the package that
[SPEAKER_01]: is 70 days from the day you turn the timer
to 1212 so day one is the day you flip the
[SPEAKER_01]: timer it always will be always has been
the last time I did this episode I got
[SPEAKER_01]: comments that said why do you get to
decide that why do I get to decide that I
[SPEAKER_01]: made the fucking seeds I printed the
fucking packages I know that I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: decide it I grew the I bred these seeds I
grew them I noticed takes me 70 days to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower these in my rooms I sent them out
to other people those people said
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere between 65 and 75 days I said
the average of that 70 days so I wrote
[SPEAKER_01]: that on the package that's how I know
that's why I get to decide I made the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking seeds I'm the breeder I'm the the
proprietor of this company I wrote that on
[SPEAKER_01]: the package because I have tested these
plants I've ran them a lot of times other
[SPEAKER_01]: people have ran them and we have
determined that on average in most rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: in most cases those plants are gonna take
60 to 70 days to finish why do we start
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower timer on day one as day one
because that's when day one is why would
[SPEAKER_01]: you wait till you see puff balls because
other people are gonna see those puff
[SPEAKER_01]: balls are gonna appear day 12 day 17 now
you're five days you're five days off
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule why would just do it the day you
flip the timer there's no algebra to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done here there's no math there's no
questions day one is day one when you flip
[SPEAKER_01]: the timer that is day one write it the
fuck down get a calendar write it down
[SPEAKER_01]: make a note in your phone I flipped this
room on this date in my calendar app in my
[SPEAKER_01]: phone I'll open it up right now it shows
I've got multiple environments in
[SPEAKER_01]: different places going on so let's see the
seventh was week three in my main room the
[SPEAKER_01]: 14th will be week four and I've just got
the 28th is week six I just went through
[SPEAKER_01]: April and every Monday since I started my
plants on a Monday on that Monday I just
[SPEAKER_01]: went through and marked the calendar one
through whatever I go all the way up to
[SPEAKER_01]: week 10 sometimes I flower 11 weeks but I
don't I won't need that note at that far
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mark it in the calendar room one
tent a flowered and it's it fucking today
[SPEAKER_01]: is the 12th so the seventh was the
beginning of week three we're halfway work
[SPEAKER_01]: through work three I'm stuttering but yeah
we're about to catch up and begin week
[SPEAKER_01]: four so mark that note and then something
else to pay attention to those numbers on
[SPEAKER_01]: those packs like I said before I ran that
plant I ran those seeds and most of those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds took 65 to 75 days to flower so I
marked that fucking pack 70 days that is
[SPEAKER_01]: the average which you're gonna get there
will be outliers I saw a great quote on
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet I can't even Guppy said it
Guppy said I wrote 70 days on that pack
[SPEAKER_01]: however the plants didn't read that note
some of those plants may take 75 some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them may take 85 days there are outliers
within phenotypes there are outliers
[SPEAKER_01]: within packages there are outliers in
population is the word I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: most of those seeds are going to finish at
the 70-day mark for you some of them may
[SPEAKER_01]: finish at day 60 some may finish at day 80
the bulk of them 75 to 80% of them will be
[SPEAKER_01]: done in 70 days is why I put that on the
package you're gonna have outliers based
[SPEAKER_01]: on genetics there's gonna be outliers just
genetically things are going to be that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how genetics work also your environment
will make a difference the kind of light
[SPEAKER_01]: the intensity of light the hours of light
the spectrum of the light that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a difference your VPD will make a
difference your soil will make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference your feeding will make a
difference and possibly if you really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get hippy-dippy about it I have no
proof of this but the moon and the Sun and
[SPEAKER_01]: the seasons will have an effect on your
indoor plants as well so all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things could have an effect so the let's
jump right back to it when is day one is
[SPEAKER_01]: the basic of this question when is day one
if you have a 10-week plant it says 10
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks on the package does that 10 start as
soon as I switch yes that starts as soon
[SPEAKER_01]: as you switch so that first short night
that is day one that time that it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: into 1212 that that's day one start
counting from that point um dude I really
[SPEAKER_01]: think I answered your question and then
some so my dude Cody thank you for getting
[SPEAKER_01]: me rambling on that one make sure you
check your inbox because you have a coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: code for a free pack of seeds at I read
direct comm and just to be nice I will let
[SPEAKER_01]: that coupon code ride for a few extra days
so that you can jump in and get that 420
[SPEAKER_01]: sale on April 18th at I read direct comm
I've got a good momentum going I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna slow it down we're gonna jump right
into the next question this one came from
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't have their name that they want
to be called on it but I'm going to send
[SPEAKER_01]: you a pack of seeds anyway we're just
gonna call you Tina Tina thank you for the
[SPEAKER_01]: great question it says I have a question
about light leaks in a grow tent which is
[SPEAKER_01]: a very good question is growing outside
wait is growing outside more superior than
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor does the moon affect the cannabis
like a light leak would so that's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: good question I will reread this and make
it make a little more sense for you thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you for what you bring information to
everybody I've learned a lot I love to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen thank you again Tina thank you for
the great question what Tina is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: asking I always talk about how light leaks
are very important in an indoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: environment they're important to not have
light leaks what do I mean by a light leak
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a whole new thing to open up there
a light leak when we're growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a dark period that night period
the sleeping period that period cannot be
[SPEAKER_01]: interrupted by light that dark period
needs to be completely dark for 12 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: zero light no light at all not a light on
a like if you have an air conditioner or
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have some sort of monitoring device
if there's a light on there that light
[SPEAKER_01]: counts we don't want that light a light
leak is when that darkness is interrupted
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say you've got a tent and a flap
comes open and light gets in there light
[SPEAKER_01]: has now leaked into your environment light
leaks do cause problems and grows they can
[SPEAKER_01]: lead to intersex traits they can slow your
plants down from growing light leaks can
[SPEAKER_01]: be very detrimental so my new friend Tina
is asking basically if we're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: outside why doesn't the moon affect these
plants why don't we get light leaks from
[SPEAKER_01]: the moon and also we're gonna touch on
like things like streetlights we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: touch on cars passing by planes flying by
helicopters porch lights just lights like
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're gonna include that in this
topic here so keep in mind I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any notes this is all coming out of memory
nothing here to give me a guide on this
[SPEAKER_01]: answer the answer is the short answer is
phytochrome and far-red lighting that is
[SPEAKER_01]: the short answer so let me explain
outdoors in an outdoor grow environment
[SPEAKER_01]: our plants are outside getting sunshine
all day right they're getting beat by
[SPEAKER_01]: sunshine the first factor here is that
sunlight is way more powerful than any
[SPEAKER_01]: grow light you will ever imagine any grow
light you could ever buy it's the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum it's the most intense thing that
there is and it's natural that is what the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are intuitively instinctively
primordially whatever it is that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that makes those plants go yes that
is the main thing for plants and they know
[SPEAKER_01]: it so when they're out there in the
sunshine they're getting exactly what they
[SPEAKER_01]: need and it's a way different feeding than
the little grow light in your house that's
[SPEAKER_01]: barely a light compared to the Sun so
that's something to keep in mind as we
[SPEAKER_01]: delve down this journey here another thing
to think about as the Sun is setting
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors it begins to put off a spectrum
that becomes red in the color spectrum as
[SPEAKER_01]: it sets I can't tell you exactly how this
happens but I know it does just trust me
[SPEAKER_01]: as the Sun sets it begins to put off a red
spectrum because of its angle in the sky
[SPEAKER_01]: now that spectrum puts off a far-red
spectrum of lighting the color of lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: is far-red you can't see it with your eye
but if you have meters and understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: color is far-red lighting now that far-red
light tells that plant it triggers in that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant phytochrome phytochrome is a as an
enzyme or a protein somebody correct me
[SPEAKER_01]: there I told you I didn't write any notes
so phytochrome is triggered in this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochrome tells the plant it is sleepy
time phytochrome is basically giving this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant a little bit of ambient and a nice
shot of Nyquil and maybe even giving it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little tug before it goes to bed if you
want so it sleeps real nice so as the Sun
[SPEAKER_01]: sets it creates that far-red spectrum that
far-red triggers the phytochrome in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants the plants go hey it's time for me
to fucking sleep they put their little
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep mask on they rub one out they take
some ambient they take a shot of Nyquil
[SPEAKER_01]: and they lay down and they're tucked the
fuck in so that moon is natural that moon
[SPEAKER_01]: is there that amount of light coming from
the moon is reflection from the Sun
[SPEAKER_01]: technically and it is not enough light
compared to the Sun it is not enough light
[SPEAKER_01]: to even bother those plants first of all
because the intensity of the Sun is so
[SPEAKER_01]: much more intense than that reflection
coming from the moon that it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: bother them and that's what those plants
are programmed to do that's naturally what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens whatever you believe in I'm gonna
say jock cuz I'm a rasta man but the
[SPEAKER_01]: creator the most high mother nature would
not have put a living thing out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: would struggle because of the moon and the
Sun those are natural things that nature
[SPEAKER_01]: jaw the most high whatever you believe in
it knows that shit is there and it knows
[SPEAKER_01]: that these plants are gonna be out there
in that environment so nature wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: make it to where the moon fucked up that
plant nature just wouldn't do that
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you believe in or don't believe
in even if you're an atheist you could
[SPEAKER_01]: believe you can say nature or science
would not have done that to us or the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant simply wouldn't survive so that
sunlight is a very minimal reflection of a
[SPEAKER_01]: big-ass fucking light so you're getting I
don't know the mathematical percent but if
[SPEAKER_01]: the light is a thousand the Sun is a
thousand the moon is a two so it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not even there it's it's like that
little nightlight in the corner when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at home trying to sleep you don't
even notice that that shit's there the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants don't notice that because the
percentage of light that it was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: all day compared to the moon reflection
and the combination of the far-red
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting triggering the phytochrome
response to tuck the plants into sleep now
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing comes into play when we
talk about like your porch light or a
[SPEAKER_01]: street light this depends on a couple of
things how close to your plants are those
[SPEAKER_01]: lights how intense are those lights how
frequent are those lights what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule are those lights on then it also
depends on the sensitivity of that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that is being affected there's something
in a plant I'm thinking of the word I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: scrolling it's called the critical period
the critical period is how much darkness
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant needs to initiate its flowering
cycle based on its location on the earth
[SPEAKER_01]: where that plant came from or its parents
came from it may need less or more
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness to go into flower also that same
thing goes into effect on how much light
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to piss that plant off when it is
in its dark cycle and flowering so a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants most plants a lot of the plants
we're growing now will work well outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: and not be bothered too much by a little
bit of light if you've got a porch light
[SPEAKER_01]: right above your plants that might fuck
them up if you got a street light right
[SPEAKER_01]: above your plants that might fuck them up
but if you if they're a little bit away
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not super intense and you've got
plants that have been adjusted to an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor environment it should not have too
much effect this is going to be plant
[SPEAKER_01]: specific like I'm talking about as I
reached up to describe the street light
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard people say just shoot that
street light out just disconnect that
[SPEAKER_01]: street light ruin that street light in
some way don't do that because when you do
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy that street light or that lamp
that outdoor light the city is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come replace that bulb and when they do
they're gonna look down and they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: go oh this motherfucker shot it out
because he's growing weed down there and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna be mad at you they don't
care you're growing weed they don't give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit until you shot out their light and
now they're pissed now they're gonna call
[SPEAKER_01]: the cops on you and charge you for the
light and charge you for the fuck and weed
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing so don't destroy that light
that is just a small random piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: advice so the question is I was oddly
worded but I got it figured out we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in a tent and light leaks matter
why doesn't the moon fuck with our plants
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all because John knew better the
most I knew it was like I'm gonna give you
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun I'm gonna give you moon they have to
work together I can't fuck that up so John
[SPEAKER_01]: knew that one but then also far-red
lighting phytochrome response the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are tucked in that is magically what's
doing it I am affiliated with a grow light
[SPEAKER_01]: company but there are grow lights out
there that do have a far-red lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: attached to them give them a try if you
want to I have not tried it I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsored by that company but I heard they
do great shit all right uh my friend Tina
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you for the great question um I am
going to send you a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds so make sure you check your
inbox all right ganja farmers I have one
[SPEAKER_01]: more great question here in front of me

[SPEAKER_01]: to some of those old episodes leave some
comments click like give me some likes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the algorithm I do appreciate it now let's
stay on track and jump into this next
[SPEAKER_01]: question this one came from my friend who
wants to be called patient Kentucky in big
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to my buddy patient Kentucky in
there is a long intro at the start of this
[SPEAKER_01]: one it says we met at the DGC cup yo it's
great meeting you there's a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: going on you've been listening for a while
and thank you I appreciate that I do want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get right to the question it says on
one of your shows you said something about
[SPEAKER_01]: a strain that does not have a male
chromosome or something like that you went
[SPEAKER_01]: on to say that the strain would never have
a male plant can you go into deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: details about how this happens and why you
cannot have a male from that strain I do
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you're talking about and we're
gonna touch on this there's one small
[SPEAKER_01]: detail you might have overlooked said can
this cultivar ever have a male plant
[SPEAKER_01]: created possibly yes then it said I'm a
desert storm veteran thank you for your
[SPEAKER_01]: support my dude you are a desert storm
veteran thank you for your service I
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely do respect and appreciate the
veterans said perhaps I will have more
[SPEAKER_01]: questions when my favorite plant becomes
legal alright there's a lot of stuff going
[SPEAKER_01]: on this question but I want to focus on
this one part here about I said in a
[SPEAKER_01]: previous episode that there is a plant
that does not have male chromosomes or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that I want to touch on
this and just clear this up because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know if other people caught this I
don't know if I said something wonky or
[SPEAKER_01]: misled you so a female plant a pure female
plant does not have male chromosomes so
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm talking about in to recap on your
question what I'm talking about in that
[SPEAKER_01]: episode I have a golden goat female plant
which is a pure female so that is two X
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes that's two girl female
chromosomes if there was a Y in there that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a male so that's mainly what I'm
talking about when I say that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a male chromosome it's a female plant
I have fucked with this plant I've
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulated this plant it doesn't herm out
it doesn't give me stress issues so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm talking about when there's no
male chromosome in that plant it is just a
[SPEAKER_01]: pure female now here's where the magic
with that lack of male chromosomes happens
[SPEAKER_01]: this is where people may have gotten
confused where the things start to change
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a female no male chromosomes
that's a normal thing that just happens
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how females work there's no Y's
it's all X's genetics genes what I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: do now is I'm going to treat my double X
plant with a solution and it is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: create pollen which is all X's and no Y's
so now I'm creating all female pollen I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: then going to take that female pollen and
put it on other solid female plants X X
[SPEAKER_01]: plants no Y's anywhere in this mix so now
that I've taken a female plant I've
[SPEAKER_01]: treated it with a solution and now that
female plant is creating anthers with all
[SPEAKER_01]: female pollen and I'm gonna put that
female pollen on female plants there will
[SPEAKER_01]: be no Y chromosome in my mathematical
equation here so there's no male involved
[SPEAKER_01]: there will be all female plants making all
female seeds here that's that's why I said
[SPEAKER_01]: no male chromosome so I hope I cleared
that up I'm not sure what I said to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that confusing but just in case anybody
out there misheard misunderstood the
[SPEAKER_01]: something about a strain that doesn't have
a male chromosome or something like that
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I just doesn't it's a female plant
there were other plants in the batch that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from that batch of seeds that were
never released those could have had a male
[SPEAKER_01]: in there but the plant that I have is pure
female the seed that I grew the seed the
[SPEAKER_01]: clone that I acquired is all female it's a
clone plant that I got it's all female
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no male chromosomes in there so
I'm just gonna repeat myself by taking
[SPEAKER_01]: that female and reversing it and putting
it on another female I never said male in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and people are gonna say the word
hermaphrodite when I talk about reversals
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not accurate that's not true that's
not real that's a weird random fake
[SPEAKER_01]: argument so that doesn't count that's not
even there's no hermaphroditism in my
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding project in any reversal if done
correctly if there's a hermaphrodite an
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex plant it's been fucking chopped
the fuck up and put it in the compost bin
[SPEAKER_01]: so um there is no male chromosome simply
because I'm using all female plants um
[SPEAKER_01]: could you make a male strain let's see and
why you cannot have a male can this
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar ever have a male created you
could treat it with epiphone and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: masculinize that plant yes that's a whole
nother process whole nother whole nother
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking podcast to talk about but you
could yes um my dude I think I've answered
[SPEAKER_01]: your question I hope so um the females
don't have male chromosomes because they
[SPEAKER_01]: simply don't and it's not an intersex
plant so there's no hidden agenda in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I reverse it it only makes female
pollen I'm gonna put it on other female
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that have been tested so in that
situation no male chromosomes only females
[SPEAKER_01]: all right I think I answered this one my
