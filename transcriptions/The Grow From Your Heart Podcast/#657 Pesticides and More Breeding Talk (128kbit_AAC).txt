like to start the show off with bad news
[SPEAKER_00]: but this has been one of the main topics
in the cannabis community unfortunately we
[SPEAKER_00]: have not we have lost another wonderful
member of the cannabis community a great
[SPEAKER_00]: soldier a great contributor a great
educator somebody with more passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis than a lot of people in this
industry has left the building we no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer have Frenchy cannoli with us
Frenchy has passed away to my
[SPEAKER_00]: understandings it was due to complications
to heart surgery so let's turn down the
[SPEAKER_00]: music real low and send a big special
thank you shout out to Frenchy cannoli
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy was known for making some of the
finest hash on the planet he was a teacher
[SPEAKER_00]: he taught people how to make amazing hash
he was that foreign dude at all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: events we went to the guy that said ooh la
la when he smoked good concentrates with
[SPEAKER_00]: you when he smoked good hash with them he
was that sharp dressed little short guy
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cool glasses and the spiky hair
maybe a little bit older than most of us
[SPEAKER_00]: that was Frenchy at all of the events all
the cannabis cups any high times event he
[SPEAKER_00]: was there a lot of concentrate events hash
events he was there Frenchy was a staple
[SPEAKER_00]: in the community Frenchy was a legend so
big shout out to Frenchy rest in peace
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy rest in power Frenchy has taught
so many people how to make great
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates so Frenchy will live on
forever through those new hash makers
[SPEAKER_00]: through the next generation so it is
somebody's job out there whoever learned
[SPEAKER_00]: from Frenchy you have to teach somebody
younger than you to carry on the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditions that Frenchy taught because
Frenchy made amazing hash so big shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to Frenchy much respect big love to madam
Frenchy big love to the entire i
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered Frenchy through the team green
avengers tga through sub cool through miss
[SPEAKER_00]: jill through that whole gang so big shout
out big love to them i know they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling the impact of losing Frenchy i saw
it all over social media everybody posted
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful photos beautiful memories so
once again big shout out and rest in peace
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy cannoli all right now let's move
on to another topic i'm sure maybe some of
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have seen the unedited dude grows
podcast i want to give a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my friends at the dude grows crew
big shout out to scotty the dude guru the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole gang maybe you saw the unedited show
that went out there was another show put
[SPEAKER_00]: out i went on there live today we talked a
little bit hung out with my buddy scotty i
[SPEAKER_00]: want to give scotty the dude guru
everybody behind the scenes a big high
[SPEAKER_00]: five a big fist bump much respect nothing
but love and respect for that whole crew
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah that's all i'm going to say about
that let's move forward let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis we've already gone on for
a couple of minutes haven't talked too
[SPEAKER_00]: much about growing i did see something
that we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about maybe you might want to notice this
and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: so that means i can go to your commercial
grow facility whether it's cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes or whatever your farm is and i
can teach your lead cultivator to train
[SPEAKER_00]: your staff about proper pesticide
application and handling and safety so i
[SPEAKER_00]: understand pesticides quite a bit i
understand what i should and should not be
[SPEAKER_00]: using where and where i should not be
using it safety protocols i understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what i'm doing so when i talk about
pesticides don't think i'm willy nilly
[SPEAKER_00]: with anything i am a little bit ocd a
little bit crazy about pesticide safety
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that shit because i've been
trained and i feel like i should be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a role model and also when you're me
the white guy with dreadlocks growing weed
[SPEAKER_00]: people look for flaws so my pesticide
regiment has to be on lock has to be safe
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be approved by the department of
agriculture i got to keep my shit together
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to that because people want
to find reasons to pick at you so i did
[SPEAKER_00]: mix up an approved pesticide that you can
spray outdoors of your residential area
[SPEAKER_00]: just a very light basic uh from the
fucking store down the street just from
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardware store it's not going to hurt
anything but it will get rid of the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that may come from those plants so i did a
little a perimeter spray i've been trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to think of the word perimeter for the
past minute before it was time to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: i did a nice perimeter spray i just mixed
up a pump sprayer and walked around the
[SPEAKER_00]: house and just gave it a nice spray right
at the base where the house meets the the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt or whatever just right where the
corner is there just give it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: spray just a little dale gribble a little
uh little rusty shackleford if you will
[SPEAKER_00]: went around the whole house and just gave
it a little blast and then i mixed up a
[SPEAKER_00]: different pesticide for the plants inside
and i gave them a little blast i went a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit harder than i normally would
have usually i spray on a monday and then
[SPEAKER_00]: on thursday and then i'll skip a monday
and spray on thursday and monday and then
[SPEAKER_00]: skip the thursday do two sprays monday and
thursday but i skip a day uh so i don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: too many spray applications every monday
and thursday but i skip after two i skip
[SPEAKER_00]: the third one i hope that makes sense the
way i said it so anyway i sprayed outside
[SPEAKER_00]: because where are all of those bugs gonna
go my neighbors cut down their shrubbery
[SPEAKER_00]: there's got to be some kind of bugs in
there whether it's beetles or some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips or so i don't know what could be in
their aphids probably uh those are common
[SPEAKER_00]: around here outdoors uh so i could have
gotten some aphids on me in my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever i didn't want that to happen so i
put a little pesticides in the air to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that that shit didn't happen then we
treated the inside so if you see your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors what i'm getting at is if you
see your neighbors doing something if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're cutting down the trees cutting
down the bushes doing outside landscaping
[SPEAKER_00]: or gardening that you think may disrupt
the uh population
[SPEAKER_00]: of insects that are living there that have
decided to take in something that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: that's approved that you uh don't feel
like you have uh problems what's the word
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm looking for ethical problem spring on
your plants um so um and also clean up
[SPEAKER_00]: your house while you're at it if there's
like uh old wood pile or some shit back
[SPEAKER_00]: there there could be a fucking snake in
that shit but also there could be a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of bugs living in there just waiting for
you to disturb to disturb them or wait
[SPEAKER_00]: they're waiting for your garden to go into
week eight of flower and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking invade so go clean up all the
weird areas outside of your house too if
[SPEAKER_00]: your neighbors are cleaning up those
shrubs in those bushes maybe it's time for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to do it at the same time uh get all
that shit out of there get a dumpster
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that shit up but clean up all the
weird uh shrubbery the leaves uh the
[SPEAKER_00]: debris around your house if you can
that'll help you out with your pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control your integrated pest management
now since i'm talking about this people
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to talk about uh how do you
manage your pest i don't want to talk too
[SPEAKER_00]: deeply about integrated pest management
but i'll give you a couple of hints i've
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned before that i am certified by
the colorado department of agriculture i
[SPEAKER_00]: am trained the trainer certified i can go
to your commercial grow and show you
[SPEAKER_00]: videos and give you a day-long class it's
not even that long but i can teach your
[SPEAKER_00]: employees and teach you how to keep your
employees safe how to properly handle and
[SPEAKER_00]: disperse pesticides how to handle and use
what are the other words anyway teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: all the pesticide training that you need
to know i can't even think of the right
[SPEAKER_00]: words right because i'm on the spot trying
to talk fast i'm certified with pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: uh shout out to thea walker she is who
trained me so uh some credentials there uh
[SPEAKER_00]: but my pesticide regimen is i spray
pesticides i've got a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides of different levels on the
shelf i know that i can mix some things
[SPEAKER_00]: together and i cannot mix some things
together so i've got a monday spray and a
[SPEAKER_00]: thursday spray they're usually not the
same things but i kind of rotate um so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say there are five products and i'll
spray on monday i'll spray one product on
[SPEAKER_00]: tuesday i'll spray a different product or
thursday sorry skip the next day which
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the monday but then on the next
thursday i'll spray a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: product so i just work my way down the
list until i'm back to the start that way
[SPEAKER_00]: the pests never have the opportunity to
build any resistance to what i'm spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: them uh if every day i you walk into the
grow room and i throw a left hook my left
[SPEAKER_00]: hook is weak i should never throw a left
hook anyway if i throw a left jab at your
[SPEAKER_00]: face by day four or five you're either
going to be fine with taking a jab to the
[SPEAKER_00]: face or you're going to have a good block
one of the two will happen the spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites will become the same way if every
day you punch them with that left jab
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the face they're going to walk in
they're going to dodge it they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take it on the face or they're going to
block it it's not going to bother them so
[SPEAKER_00]: if you throw a left hook on day one throw
that fucking right cross on day two and
[SPEAKER_00]: they kick them in the balls on day three
they have no idea what the fuck to do so
[SPEAKER_00]: if you hit them with different pesticides
in rotation different modes of action at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time they cannot build resistance
they can i guess but not as quickly not as
[SPEAKER_00]: easily it's not as likely so i spray
pesticides i've got a few products that i
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate i do mix different pesticides
together if you understand what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing if you don't see any adverse
reactions there shouldn't be a problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing certain pesticides i'll mix a
chalky pesticide i'll put that into the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution first and shake the shit out of
it to where it's emulsified then i'll add
[SPEAKER_00]: an oilier a more oily sticky pesticide in
there and shake it to where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: emulsified and then i feel like the
powdery one is spread through the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sticky one works as like a i can't
think of the word it helps it stick to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant there's a word a wedding agent i
said the word in my head and then it got
[SPEAKER_00]: away from me but there's like a wedding
agent that will help it stick to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants a little bit better which is that
sticky the sticky like something like
[SPEAKER_00]: evergreen is a little bit more sticky
evergreen or azimax is stickier and
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll help your plant stick there's a
word that i really want to say in my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: will not say it something like cocoa wet
it's the same shit that cocoa wet does
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro something anyway i gotta move on
from that or my brain will get stuck all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so i do mix a few pesticides
together um the reason is you want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that's different modes of action maybe
like one pesticide will make uh the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: forget to eat and then the other pesticide
will uh actually has a beneficial bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll make a mushroom grow inside of
that bug and that mushroom explodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: that bug is dead at that point uh there
are things like that you can do so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: really attack these bugs from different
angles also one of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: things to do is understand the pests that
you are going to face what bugs are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in your grow we're all going to deal
with spider mites thrips aphids fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats white flies those are things you can
almost fucking count on if you're outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna get uh caterpillars you're
gonna get all kinds of weird random shit
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors you better prepare for that so
think about what's coming to your grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area indoors like i said fungus gnats
white flies uh thrips spider mites be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for those things apply a
preventative pesticide on a schedule that
[SPEAKER_00]: will make those bugs not want to go there
don't let the soil get super wet they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be there in the super wet soil um a
sticker spreader what's the other word for
[SPEAKER_00]: like something that sticks and spreads a
product all right it'll come to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: then i'll fucking yell it out at like five
in the morning i'll wake up in a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: sweat and i'll come record it for you and
just say that word over the mix here um so
[SPEAKER_00]: uh hit them with different angles uh know
what pest you're going to attack that's
[SPEAKER_00]: very important because you can't just go
spraying somebody i see it on social media
[SPEAKER_00]: what what can i spray for bugs i don't
know what fucking bugs do you have it's
[SPEAKER_00]: way better if you know what bugs you're
going to spray for uh white flies you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to use uh a bt uh bacillus
thuringiensis right treat for that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the white flies fungus gnats i might do
evergreen and the soil i might do uh
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in gonads what's that bacteria
that's in gonads it could be the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing honestly i would do like a uh
botanogard max soil dredge or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that if i had too many fungus gnats
for spider mites we're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing things and hit multiple different
products at the same time so it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about which pest you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do dreads up in the hat when you
get to another grow take your dreads out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that hat put them in another one do the
best you can to be preventative I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot going on but this is
important to keep bugs out of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more important to keep the bugs out
of the commercial grow than the personal
[SPEAKER_00]: grow you're not allowed as many products
in that commercial grow and there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much more at risk so prevention is number
one then scouting in my opinion scouting
[SPEAKER_00]: for bugs is your next step pay attention
are you looking for problems are you
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling off a leaf do you have yellow
sticky traps do you have hanging cards do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have something to indicate some sort
of indicator hey bro there are bugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: here so prevent scout once you see you've
got a bug problem identify the bug I've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about that we can treat wrong and
mess up the plants more and not do any
[SPEAKER_00]: good spend money on the application on the
product time on the application fuck up
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants piss the plants off more not
even apply the right thing and the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: are still there tomorrow and you're just
pissed off identify the bugs get the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate product for those bugs you're
going to have to decide what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: products you want to use how nuclear are
you going to go I always try to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Ag guidelines for my
personal grow as well just make it a habit
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you got to go a little bit
harder plants that come in from if I get a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone from another source at this point I
will treat it with something something
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking nuclear because I'm not letting
any new bugs come in on clones ever again
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up I've done that more than once
not gonna happen again it's my fault I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to prevent that so um make sure that
you're treating with the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide that you feel appropriate if
you've got spider mites that are making
[SPEAKER_00]: webs and shit on your plants some fucking
hippie soap some like pesticide some safer
[SPEAKER_00]: soap isn't gonna do it you need a real
pesticide you need to step it up think
[SPEAKER_00]: about that think about the level of
pesticide you need to use and what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with using so then attack from
all angles and be persistent is the next
[SPEAKER_00]: method of attack I've got written down
once you've identified your pest find how
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of it what is that pest
reproductive cycle how long do the babies
[SPEAKER_00]: last how long do the adults last how do
they eat what do they enjoy then fuck that
[SPEAKER_00]: all up don't give them the opportunity to
reproduce if they lay eggs and reproduce
[SPEAKER_00]: in three days spray every other day so
they never get the opportunity for their
[SPEAKER_00]: babies to keep living get on top of them
learn their life cycle learn what
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide eradicates them you can easily
go to Google and you can type fungus net
[SPEAKER_00]: eradication pesticide application and it
will show you six or seven different not
[SPEAKER_00]: only like specific products it'll show you
like evergreen bacillus thuringiensis
[SPEAKER_00]: products but it'll show you a product and
it will also show you active ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can look for products with
that active ingredient based in it find
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three of those things maybe there's
one product with two or three things and
[SPEAKER_00]: then attack those bugs with that on a
strategy if you can get multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides so that you can hit them on
Monday with that fucking jab hit them on
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday with that right cross then on
Monday morning again kick them right in
[SPEAKER_00]: the balls and then when they think they're
gonna stand up again on Thursday you stomp
[SPEAKER_00]: right on their neck with another pesticide
and fucking destroy them don't let them
[SPEAKER_00]: come that is don't let them come that
sounded worse than it was supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: don't let them thrive that's what I really
meant somebody edit that shit I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna anyway destroy those bugs in there
get them with multiple methods of attack
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple pesticides mixed together or on a
rotation so they can't develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance knock them the fuck down as
quickly as possible have a plan have a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule understand what you're spraying
what are you spraying why are you spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: it because I'm spraying this product
because it's got this main ingredient
[SPEAKER_00]: which is effective on this pest which I
have in the grow that that's what you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to say why are you spraying
this because I have mites was that product
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to kill spider mites yes it is
okay that's a very good first start now
[SPEAKER_00]: what is your schedule of spraying it
because you spray it once you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: kill the spider mites the adults that are
alive now but eggs are going to hatch in
[SPEAKER_00]: two to three maybe four days then you got
a whole new spider mite infestation so we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get back in there and spray in two
to three maybe four days to stop those new
[SPEAKER_00]: mites and guess what we got to do it again
but now the mites are probably building
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance because we hit them with three
left jabs if you're using the same product
[SPEAKER_00]: switch it up use a different product get
that right cross in there so you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be diligent you've got to have a strategy
you got to have a plan and there has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a reason when we go to treat pests this
isn't just like kind of fly by the seat of
[SPEAKER_00]: our pants this is when strategy and
thinking ahead three or four weeks really
[SPEAKER_00]: comes into play you've really got to think
about it ahead I try to stress how
[SPEAKER_00]: important it is to think ahead when you're
growing and some people still don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand but maybe now that I've said
think three or four weeks ahead when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with pests maybe you
actually understand those pests when you
[SPEAKER_00]: think they're gone by the way they're not
gone they're not gone yet never think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all the way gone because that's
when they come back when you get relaxed
[SPEAKER_00]: and lazy on the pesticides that's when
they reappear all right I'm not sure how
[SPEAKER_00]: long I've been going but I do feel like I
can probably answer this message here this
[SPEAKER_00]: one comes from our friend red eye let's
segue into the email portion of the show
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend red eye sent me a message it
says you got me thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottleneck theory could we be causing this
by breeding hybrids to hybrids and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: says like my concern is eventually too
many background genetic variation shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to my buddy red eye this is a very
good question so what red eye is talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about is the bottleneck theory and this is
something as a cannabis breeder with
[SPEAKER_00]: limited space that I have to worry about
excuse me I do feel like I have a kombucha
[SPEAKER_00]: burp coming I apologize for that I'm just
trying to get it out of the way there we
[SPEAKER_00]: go let's move forward so bottleneck
bottleneck theory that would be basically
[SPEAKER_00]: to where when we were breeding that
everything becomes the same thing it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to look the same smell the same
because we've used all the same genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is happening a little bit in
cannabis because my response to him
[SPEAKER_00]: directly was yeah for ten years it was all
kush so for about ten years everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: just breeding kush everything at the
dispensary everything on the street was og
[SPEAKER_00]: kush skywalker kush bubba kush ghost kush
something og some sort of banana og fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: og foot og rapper name og there's Wiz
Khalifa og snoop og Kanye West og there
[SPEAKER_00]: was all kinds of kushes and ogs and they
were all just breeding inbred stuff to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff just so they could say they
had their own kush crosses so for about
[SPEAKER_00]: ten years yeah it was all kush brother all
of it was kush you could go to every
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in LA every dispensary in
NorCal and it was kush kush kush kush og
[SPEAKER_00]: kush kush og skywalker kush moon dancer
kush dog fucker kush kitten liquor kush it
[SPEAKER_00]: was all there you could get it all and
then in Colorado the trend followed right
[SPEAKER_00]: along there are a bunch of dispensaries on
Broadway where it was just a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different kush then for five years excuse
me for the word slurring there for five
[SPEAKER_00]: years maybe even more maybe the past five
or ten years it has been cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: everything has been bred to cookies
everything has got cookies in it somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: along the line a lot of the shit has got
kush and cookies in it to be quite honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with you those are some of kush cookies
possibly has kush in it too I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to debate what's in the cookies with you
at this point but yeah for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was kush and cookies and then
chem would show up we'd have chem 91 chem
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 chem D chem sister some straight chem
dog that was in a lot of shit for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time and then we had a lot of crosses that
were chem kush cookies all of it was chem
[SPEAKER_00]: kush cookies so yeah there is a little bit
of bottleneck happening and you see it now
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of the dessert named strains
those are all cookie derivatives with like
[SPEAKER_00]: a kush background with some sort of other
sativa in there to boost up the buzz to it
[SPEAKER_00]: to boost up the productivity to make it
commercially viable so yeah it was all for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while it was all kush then we got a lot
of cookies you'd get some chem show up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix there then it was all kush chem
cookie crosses and then like I said then
[SPEAKER_00]: it became all dessert named stuff like
pastry and dessert named things that like
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying were really heavily
influenced by a lot of the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies line a lot of that is done by hype
a lot of that is done by market demand a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that is done because it's what is
available there's a demand for that when
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies was popular if you had Girl Scout
cookies they would buy that if you were a
[SPEAKER_00]: free market retailer you had Girl Scout
cookies or anything else if you just went
[SPEAKER_00]: down the list of strains you had available
I'll sell you this I'll sell you this I
[SPEAKER_00]: got Girl Scout cookies nobody heard
anything after you said Girl Scout cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: like just shut up and give me the cookies
bro so everybody had the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies and then people were breeding to
it because they all had it so then
[SPEAKER_00]: everything became crossed with the cookies
I'm not mad about it some of the cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses are great I've made a couple of my
own there's the cookie stomper there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: burning spear there's coffee cake which
we've talked about in the past I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: forget you brother my friend that's
emailing me I've just been overloaded
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of cookie crosses out
there I love the Girl Scout cookies it was
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking amazing but I got tired of it
because everywhere I went that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody was growing smoking selling
fucking trying to get me to smell posting
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of it it was just cookies cookies
cookies and I love it but at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: like how many times can you smoke the same
fucking strain so for a while it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies just cookies now cookies is in
everything I'm not mad about it but all
[SPEAKER_00]: the strains now have somewhere down the
line there is cookies in the mix which
[SPEAKER_00]: means when I breed to it I've got to breed
to something without cookies in it which
[SPEAKER_00]: is what I really try to do I try I fall
into it sometimes I did use the biscotti
[SPEAKER_00]: to make the soccer souffle but shot it to
my buddy Matt I don't know what social
[SPEAKER_00]: media handle name to use for you today
shot it to my buddy friendly fire farms he
[SPEAKER_00]: threw me the biscotti cut I use that to
make the soccer souffle I was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and I like Matt and he left me that
plant he had to move and he donated that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to the arsenal I felt like it fit I
was a little bit different than everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else I have it does have cookies in it the
biscotti does have cookies in it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I bred the soccer souffle with I try
not to follow those trends you guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: really try to breed outward and do
different shit from everybody else but I
[SPEAKER_00]: love that fucking plant so I had to breed
with it but that's why you see me using
[SPEAKER_00]: like the platinum tangy and just totally
different things the blueberry cookies I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using things that not everybody use
blueberry cookies there's fucking cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: in that one see where we're going there's
cookies and everything so I've got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful when I breed with things to not
double up on the cookies the Kush the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim's because those are in a lot of the
popular crosses so yes bottleneck theory
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite popular and in my theory it's
basically all hybrids at this point unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting some crazy land race sativa
if you're flying to another continent and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pulling sativa seeds out of their
sativa buds that are growing right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you look this takes fucking 24
weeks to flower most of the time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting true sativas most people don't
have the time patience space patience is
[SPEAKER_00]: the key word there to grow a real sativa
I'm talking 14 16 weeks or more you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: go 14 or 16 weeks to impress me to get me
to call you like super real sativa most of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I breed I say is sativa leaning it's
all hybrids honestly there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: indica a lot of sativa in there to make
the combinations happen it's all hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: now you guys it has all been hybridized
together and it is all working toward
[SPEAKER_00]: bottleneck theory that is an absolute
possibility but luckily there are there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot of breeders that have no idea
about this sort of a thing and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to breed themselves into a circle
into a trap and they don't have anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: to go with their genetics with their
breeding with their programs they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: thought ahead they haven't thought about
Mendel charts they just haven't put a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program on paper on a spreadsheet
haven't thought about any of that for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future luckily there are breeders who are
a little more educated who care a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more I'm not bashing the other style
of breeder those guys are just doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that they're doing it they're
doing it the way they're doing I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do it this way and hopefully I can prevent
the bottlenecking and my breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully what I put out leaves
opportunity for breeding for the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: who does get my seeds all right I think I
talked a lot about that one I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go on too long yeah my computer just
went black what happened there we go
[SPEAKER_00]: screen saver technology thank you I think
that is all I've got for you for this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode I'm gonna wrap it up because I
want to be fresh for the next episode or
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next question I do have a lot to
ramble about in that one so we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to waste that one at the end of this
show we're gonna make sure to save a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of time for that in the next episode
ladies and gentlemen boys girls pimps hoes

from your heart podcast I had a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: talking through this episode good subjects
to get me talking about pesticides I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: very comfortable with and of course you
know I like to talk about breeding all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time please send me more questions I do
love to hear from you my email address is

be shy if you have questions corrections
[SPEAKER_00]: comments or concerns grow from your heart
at hotmail.com is the way to get in touch
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you check out the website at I
read genetics calm halfway down on the I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics website there's a spot that
says keep in touch or stay in contact I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it says keep in touch or stay up to
date stay updated something like that I
[SPEAKER_00]: should scroll and look and see what it
says oddly enough I don't stock my own
[SPEAKER_00]: website very much but make sure you go put
your email address in there we will send
[SPEAKER_00]: you a newsletter once a month you will
stay updated on all of the I read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: news that you need to know about also
check out the discord channel I will leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a link to the discord channel in the show
notes and the video description join us on
[SPEAKER_00]: discord we would love to have you it's a
good time over there big shout out to all
