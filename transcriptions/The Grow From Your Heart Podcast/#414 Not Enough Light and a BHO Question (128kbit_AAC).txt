[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 414 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is brought to you by our friends
at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to add fresh genetics to your
garden, and you can find them at www
[SPEAKER_00]: .oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that Oregon Elite Seeds will
have the first drop, the first release of
[SPEAKER_00]: the brand new Blue Raspberry Truffles that
will be available at Oregon Elite Seeds on
[SPEAKER_00]: 420, so don't miss that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking
[SPEAKER_00]: as the container gets closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to know, what does 420 mean to
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: On a previous episode, I asked,
what does 420 mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody replied and they said,
do you mean what does 420, the number
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the date mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the time mean to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I want to know what does 420
mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say, hey, 420, what does that spark
in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to know what 420 means to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can reach out to me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Twitter, it is at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, what does 420 mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will include that in my 420
celebration episode that I am putting
[SPEAKER_00]: together now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
in this episode, I am going to read a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get that far, let's do a few
shout outs from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant shout out to my friend,
Richard Goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to Ryan
Schmidt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a giant shout out to Brett Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a big shout out to Todd K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shout out to Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, I want to give a
big shout out to my friend, Remy Redeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big giant thanks to everybody for all of
the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you would like to learn how to
become a patron, all you need to do is go
[SPEAKER_00]: to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who has helped out on Patreon in the past,
in the present, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I did say that we have a couple of emails
[SPEAKER_00]: to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am reaching over to the email pile to
get the first victim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with this one right here on
top of the stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I initially heard you on the Dude Grow
Show, so I thought I would check out your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been diving deep and I'm really
loving all of the great knowledge you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out there for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, first off, I am really honored to
have been a guest on the Dude Grow Show
[SPEAKER_00]: that really helped out build my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to JR Token.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Maestro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody in front of the
cameras and behind the scenes at the Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treat me like royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows crew treated me like
royalty at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got nothing but love and respect
for everybody that is part of the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, and I'm glad that you're diving
deep into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when somebody discovers us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go deep and start listening to
all of the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little embarrassing, honestly,
but it is a time capsule and I'm proud of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you were listening to the old
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that you are finding knowledge
and that you are appreciating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're already pushing all the right
buttons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He continues to say, there's something for
everyone from the newbie all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that think they know everything
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the quality is top notch,
which is always welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up all the great work and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks a lot for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to start an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I also had a question
that I wanted to ask a real deal grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a grower that is about passing on bad
or misguided knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I am all about doing a little
bit of research and not trying to pass on
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit knowledge because that frustrates
the crap out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the last episode,
we had to correct a couple of errors or
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation that people were given.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is kind of what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to spread the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to encourage everybody to be
positive about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, since you always say to shoot you
any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage all of the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates amazing content for listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm helping somebody by
reading your message right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at least helping you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have this question, that means
there are probably 20 other people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that have this same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm helping you and hopefully a lot of
other people with this great listener
[SPEAKER_00]: generated content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super rambly from those lemon G dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to keep me focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grow in cocoa with an auto feed
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a four by four tent under a 1000
watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are cranking that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty intense in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'd start my plants under a small
T5 until they can take the 1K metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmed down to 500 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when they are a couple of weeks away
from flower, I up the power to 750 to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a boost of growth and to get them
used to the increased intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, that sounds right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, when they are under the 750,
one plant seems like she just doesn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: the increased intensity at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: She droops really badly after about 10 to
12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I not flower her and just get rid
of her?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to flower very soon and this has
been going on for a week or longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like she might just be a weak seed
and she's also considerably smaller than
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the other girls of the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the long winded email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hope to hear back from you from a
fellow grower signed Mitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's talk about this one a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that stood out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are from
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a couple of years ago.
This is from a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that cannibalism?
[SPEAKER_00]: If a cannabis plant rolls up a joint and
smokes it to relax, that's cannibalism,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you guys that lemon G dab really
got to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first suspicion is that that
seedling that grew smaller was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something happened to it in its very
early stages of life that stunted its
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, but you got a runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow it was either a runt by genetics
or it was damaged early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put it in the room with the other
plants and tried to increase the light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity and it was not prepared for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is reacting to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably continue to grow slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will never catch up with those other
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your next question is, should I not flower
this one and just get rid of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your garden looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your space looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the rest of the plants
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your canopy looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can call that plant and still have
a full canopy and produce your expected
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, your expected yield, if you can
meet your medicine demands by calling that
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant and still having the appropriate
size harvest, if you can meet your
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever production needs that you have
set for yourself, your production goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can reach those by calling that
plant by all means, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that one plant is going to make or
break you, keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe keep it off to the side forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's already a runt, it'll just be
off to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be that plant in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed it the last of the nutrients,
water everything else and give that one
[SPEAKER_00]: the crap at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be the best plant, but it is
another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more product.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are making concentrates
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's not the prettiest, the tightest
buds, you can still squish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still do whatever you're going to
do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant is the one that is going to
put you over your numbers, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in any illegal state and that
plant is not up to the performance level
[SPEAKER_00]: of the rest of your plants, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got time and space for that
plant, keep it around, let it try.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a tight space and a tight
position, she needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where you need to make a judgment
call, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your canopy is full and the rest of the
plants look great, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that one's not going to reach the top,
if you've got to lift it up on two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three pots to make it taller and it's
going to be a pain in the ass and cause
[SPEAKER_00]: you problems and frustrate you,
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to look forward to about week four or
five and see if that plant is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more frustration or if it's going to be
more pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to just piss you off and
that's the one plant in the room that's
[SPEAKER_00]: causing all the problems, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that kind of stuff around in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation, so it's kind
of hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably just toss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need something that grows poorly
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing from seed and you've
got a little one like that, your generally
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a phenol hunt, so you should expect
some males and you should expect some
[SPEAKER_00]: runts and some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your runty bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already planned for this, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fucking rambly from that lemon G dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you for that great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a lot of opportunity for a lot
of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fellow grower Mitch, thank you for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next email in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, I want to thank you for all of
the content you have provided me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gone from a hypothetical noob at
growing to actually knowing enough to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: me going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is my exact goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to, what do they say?
[SPEAKER_00]: You give a man a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be stoned for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You teach a man to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll get the whole crew stoned for the
rest of your lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep the whole crew stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that's your job, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you're learning how to do it,
you have dedicated yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm glad that I've got you going
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues to say, I started
listening to your podcast around the time
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow compilations were released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now starting from episode one and I
have managed to get 200 episodes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I love when people go back and listen
to the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's a little bit embarrassing
because I was not very good at podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I am quite comfortable on a mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels so weird to hear the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everybody who does recording and
broadcasting says that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, so I'm not doing too
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a smart dude and you are very easy
to listen to even with the American to UK
[SPEAKER_00]: accent barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for listening to me,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that the accent doesn't drive you
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's easy to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks with accents are hard to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm doing a great job for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues with keep up the
amazing work and I will keep recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: you to my English buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of the recommendations
that really does help to spread a podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and help us grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also helps us spread the positive message.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I have one request and I hope
this is something you could maybe dedicate
[SPEAKER_00]: an episode to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to do an episode on
making crumble wax?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm investing in the kit very soon and I
want to have your knowledge as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 YouTube videos I have watched.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the best dude and say hi to Mike
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Baz.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be doing this B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: in a very safe environment so you do not
have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's make sure that we say
shout out to white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, our new friend, Just Baz says
hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure I cover that for you
because he said specifically here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: message, say what's up to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you are, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, by the way, Mike, come record,
come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do really appreciate that this
person started off with a paragraph of
[SPEAKER_00]: compliments and then they made a request
that I cannot fulfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a crumble wax maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: By any means, I cannot safely and
effectively teach you how to make B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates without feeling like I am
going to set you up to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be irresponsible of me to try
to teach you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, you wouldn't come out with a
quality product if I taught you because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And second, you would hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would potentially hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to be responsible for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just have to respectfully and
politely say, dude, that is not for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'm doing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problems admitting that I don't
know how to make B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do it the basic ways,
but I do not know how to teach you how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it safely and effectively without
feeling like I'm setting you up to hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would feel like shit if I ever hurt
one of my friends or if one of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: caused a problem in their life with my
shitty advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize that I cannot help you out
with your request on making B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: crumble wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first advice is be more careful than
you think you need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thinks that they're good at
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, like you said, you do not have
to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get overconfident with volatile
gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overconfidence is a big cause of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your science level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your level of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying don't get overconfident
and cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a cell phone around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light switches and light bulbs can cause
problems when there's enough butane in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a legal B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction facility in Colorado,
we must be inspected by the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: department.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several building inspections and
fire department inspections required just
[SPEAKER_00]: to be allowed to run a hydrocarbon
extraction in a legal facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on the news about once it used
to be more frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be about every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's about every two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read an article or you catch an
article online of some person blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: their house up because they were making B
.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: in their bedroom, in their basement,
somewhere they should not have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do decide to make B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates on your own, please be extra
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be scientific careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra think every step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smallest mistakes cause the largest
problems when you are using hydrocarbons
[SPEAKER_00]: for extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also probably illegal to make
extractions where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got several reasons why I have to
politely decline on giving you lessons on
[SPEAKER_00]: making crumble wax or B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are much better techniques and
products to focus on making than crumble
[SPEAKER_00]: wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to make diamonds and sauce if you're
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put yourself in the
situation, do it correctly and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: diamonds and the sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste time with the crumble wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I am pretty sure that you are going
to go against my friendly advice and you
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to make your own B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates because you are an adult and
that is what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no reason why I should stop
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying I can't help you too much,
but do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it goes very well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me try to give you a couple of
resources that may help you out since I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any resources from my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends at the Dude Grow Show have
done a great show on making B.H.O.
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can check out the Dude Grow Show,
probably just search for the Dude Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Show B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and you will get a great lesson
from those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would join a few cannabis related
forums and I would join a bunch of groups
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn as much as you can from those
groups about hydrocarbon extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find people in those groups that have
experience and ask them specific questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn from people who have actually
done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're watching a lot of
YouTube videos and you were following a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they are able to help you out more
than I am because again, this is not my
[SPEAKER_00]: wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, JustBaz, I apologize for letting you
down on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't have an answer for
everything, but I do hope you keep
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the show and I do hope you
keep recommending the show to your English
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you one more thanks for
sending this great email and I look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to hearing from you again in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody else out there has
questions, I would love to answer your
[SPEAKER_00]: questions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there are some things I can't help
you with, but I will do my best on most
[SPEAKER_00]: grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to wrap up
this quick midweek bonus episode of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I want to know what 420 means to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email, send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what does 420 mean to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this podcast was
educational, informative, or entertaining,
