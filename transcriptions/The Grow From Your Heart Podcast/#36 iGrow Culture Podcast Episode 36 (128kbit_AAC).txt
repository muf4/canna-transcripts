[SPEAKER_02]: It's Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursdays have been great for us lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursdays have been pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing tonight, Mike?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a stressful but fantastic week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a very stressful week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, speaking of stressful, I owe you a
huge thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we've talked about these city
council meetings for the past few
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Mike, I thought he was going to
stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a nice little seat for you
there, like a real cushy chair and a
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like a boss.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike presented a nice statement to city
council.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually had some success in what he
was trying to do, but we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: that a little bit because I really want to
spend some time on the city council
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff to talk about
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a crazy week in marijuana
ordinance news, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to that in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We for sure will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about this a little bit on the
last episode, but Clint wasn't here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint and I got to go see Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joey Diaz!
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I skipped a part I really want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, today we are celebrating Clint's
eighth year anniversary of sobriety from
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to go, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it's nothing to toot about,
but that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight years is that strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was tough before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for sticking with it because I
don't think we'd hang out if you were the
[SPEAKER_02]: drunk you were before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm still a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't showcase it as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, alcohol really displays your shitty
side, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't drink, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen the South Park on my trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can keep pretty much anything under
wraps until you get a couple of beers in
[SPEAKER_05]: you and then all of the demons come just
pouring out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a depressant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a depressant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't help me much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I quit drinking when I got my
medical marijuana card and my life is
[SPEAKER_02]: easier, happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I wake up, I know where my money is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where my car is parked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still drink occasionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have Dos Equis, but for the most
part, I quit five or six years back just
[SPEAKER_05]: because I got really good at throwing up
in bars.
[SPEAKER_05]: I distinctly remember walking up a flight
of stairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Celtic in downtown Denver
thinking like, yeah, man, you didn't get
[SPEAKER_05]: any on you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a pro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got about halfway up the stairs and it
dawned on me that that's not something I
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to be pro at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is just one of those like,
now I feel weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm like 25 and all my social life
revolves around the bars and the bar scene
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was a little weird to step out of
that for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's just where I live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alcohol doesn't play a big role.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I moved away from my party town,
it was a lot easier for me to quit
[SPEAKER_02]: drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in Lawrence, Kansas for a little
while and it's just really easy to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: Spunyan there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I came here where there's a lot
of drinking and I know everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sucked me in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once I realized what I was doing,
I just gave it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smoke all the weed I can handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a gram dab last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why would I even need alcohol in my
life at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to do another one tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do it again tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I filmed myself taking a gram dab last
night and the video was very
[SPEAKER_02]: disappointing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the dab on the dabber kind of wonky
and it just, it wasn't real.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not an impressive video.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be a fun video if we could have like
the count from Sesame Street, like
[SPEAKER_05]: photoshopped in there on one dab,
two dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me several inhales and exhales to
get that dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just partially because of the way I
dropped it on the nail, I didn't time it
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my breath and starting it was...
You were using a teeny rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a big dab on a teeny rig,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of big dabs on teeny rigs,
this podcast is brought to you by our good
[SPEAKER_02]: friends at Cannabis Grand Crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Grand Crew, you ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to check out the website,
cannabisgrandcrew.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's spelled Grand C R U like the Motley
crew is a private cannabis event in Aspen,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hosted by the Grimy Gatsby and several of
the industry leaders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have a lot more information,
but please check that out and support the
[SPEAKER_02]: Grimy Gatsby, cannabisgrandcrew.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to talk about Joey Diaz
before I got on this really huge
[SPEAKER_02]: sidetrack, but anywhere we were,
I knew where we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what we're doing, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Joey knows what he's doing,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of comedians and Anthony
Jeselnik was one of my favorites,
[SPEAKER_02]: but every second of his act from the time
he walks out to the time he says thank
[SPEAKER_02]: you, every second of that is calculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see him counting between jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see his mouth going one,
two, three, and he counts to 11 and then
[SPEAKER_02]: he tells another joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that style.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes out and that's like, if that was
a band, who would I compare that to?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every note is they know what they're doing
tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single note all the way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeselnik did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey Diaz came out and kind of had an idea
of what he was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just leveled us just being himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of that, maybe he's told those bits
two or three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the bits he told, I swear I heard
him make up on accident on the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: just a few days before he flew to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a fucking pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took that like something like just
right now, we'd be saying something and
[SPEAKER_02]: he'd be like, oh my God, dog, that's
tremendous, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm writing that shit down, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he makes 15 minutes out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brought it to us in Denver several days
later and ruined the club with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My stomach and ribs and this part of my
jaw right here was sore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was laughing so hard, I had to tense up
my back because it was hurting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to move my muscle tension somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were sitting back like a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: I realized because I was sitting forward
on the edge of my seat the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just sitting forward and just
excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just every word he was going to say
was going to make me laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jeff said it, he goes, Clint,
you were laughing harder than anybody else
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good because you appreciated the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about being a good audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint is a performer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know what it's like to have a stale
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't us kissing his ass either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey was on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, he was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he does about maybe an hour,
hour and 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he crushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no point in there when I was
bored or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then afterwards, we're like,
oh, can we meet him?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're wanting to get backstage.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Benson spoiled you, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I took a bunch of weed for Joey Diaz
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't no chump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to keep the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try to give him a little
bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then all of a sudden he talks to
every single person that wants to talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came out to the hallway of the club and
just hung out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only exit that you could take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just standing there and you could
shake his hand, get a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took a picture with everybody,
everybody, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: He asked you your name and then addresses
you by name in the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He remembers your name for that talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's that kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to Diaz, you know he
probably still remembers our names.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we see him again, he'd be like,
oh, fucking Clint, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint, right, dog?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he calls you dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every other word is dog and cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you stand up and out of the crowd just
a teeny bit on your own?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps that he's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have an extra little leg up
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're both memorable on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get some ski caps, bro,
and be Opie and Jax for Halloween.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could do that, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking like Hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little more every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a man beard over there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just got to get my wife killed somehow and
then hook up with a prostitute and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of awkward silence for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys not get the sunset?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You sent out a tweet this week about your
beard that just crushed me.
[SPEAKER_05]: With a beard like this, you can't pee
indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent about five minutes laughing at
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sort of true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, if you find beard trees
growing along the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint was plucking beard hairs out of his
beard and throwing them out the window in
[SPEAKER_02]: hopes to plant little beard trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to get back to the
community, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know how that worked if you're in
the PNW.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we hung out with Joey for probably an
hour afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody hangs out, takes a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey Diaz taps me on the shoulder and
walks away and says, Ross the Jeff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I love you, right, cocksucker?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, holy shit, he just called
me cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Clint was smooth about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He stuck out his hand and wanted that one
final like, this is my one on one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, hey, I'm going to stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an open mic comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you did, I think you told him
something about what you did just changed
[SPEAKER_02]: my mic or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it just it was real inspiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think I told him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, dog, you're an open mic or
dog?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come here, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like just took like seven steps away
from where we were into this little like
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of just off to the side ambient area
and had a talk with Clint about open mic
[SPEAKER_02]: and stand up comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to tell the world what he told
you or do you want to keep that to
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so cool just to have this like one
on one with a legend in my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a legend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, I don't get starstruck or
stuff like that because he's a cool
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just he was so personable,
but he was just like, dog, you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: write an hour a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe for two weeks, you're not going to
get nothing, but you just got to write and
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to write and you got to keep after
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get on stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, and I was just sitting
there just listening, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's because I'm not trying to tell
him anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just Joey.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, and I was he was
trying to get out of there, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, I appreciate it,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to let you get out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have a great time in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: He liked hanging out and just having a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, I got to go, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see you could see he was a
little tired, but he was just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn, I don't want to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if this gets back to Joey Diaz,
thank you for the great show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and you got you gained a fan for life
by just hanging out for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hour times two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also thanks for just taking a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're a busy dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know you had to get to the hotel and
smoke that blunt they gave you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those edibles that you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You took a minute and that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're he's been in the longest yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his own podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can take an ear bashing,
if you've got some balls, listen to The
[SPEAKER_02]: Church of What's Happening Now with Joey
Coco Diaz and Lee Syatt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for Gentiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll tell you to go fuck yourself on the
first episode you listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can get past that, it's a great
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's funny as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then and if you get a chance to see
him live, there's there's if you miss out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you will be you will regret it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an adult diaper, wear one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to piss my pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing was, I had to piss the whole
time he was up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I am not leaving for one
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would piss myself if I I was so happy to
be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the tickets were reasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw him at the Denver Improv.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful club.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to go back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be back there.

[SPEAKER_02]: There was a city council meeting on
Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some hilarious shit to talk
about from that meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot to talk about from that
meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: What part caught you as hilarious?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I go to every city council meeting for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody there knows me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm used to the police chief and the fire
chief and the city manager and the city
[SPEAKER_05]: attorney and the council members coming up
and saying hi or waving or giving me two
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes to talk to them about whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody in our community is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was sort of early to the meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had signed up to speak and from the seat
I usually sit in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see the doors that people walk in
from, but I can see the city staff and the
[SPEAKER_05]: city council real well and they're kind of
milling around waiting for the meeting to
[SPEAKER_05]: start and their decorum all just they
freeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when somebody, I don't know,
runs through a room naked and the rest of
[SPEAKER_05]: the well-dressed people go, wait,
did that just happen and everybody freezes
[SPEAKER_05]: for a second?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody froze for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I swivel my head and I see two and a
quarter sets of dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk in the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff and two supporters he brought to the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they want to be named.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, they're supporters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam and Angela.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys a lot for joining me to the
city council meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your numbers made a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, as you guys walked in,
everybody was sort of like, what hippies
[SPEAKER_05]: it's city council.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two people were Jedi staring me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could feel one guy's eyes cooking a hole
through my shirt and reading my soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was like, hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like looked at him and nodded like,
uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why you're staring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I translucent right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has he seen a ghost?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like people start speaking and I
go, I look at them while they speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get the creepy feeling again
and I look to my left and that dude is
[SPEAKER_02]: like this at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the listeners, it's an intense
stare, but like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just intense and sort of angry,
flat faced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never met the man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never met the man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm enough to like say hi and shake
his hand, but you're the city manager.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could not stop staring at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another guy who fits the exact
description of rich white guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like rich white councilmen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's who you'd think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I saw him, I'd go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: City council guy runs some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the city attorney.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The city manager looked at him and goes,
who's the guy in the hat?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was, I saw him say it like he didn't
care that I was watching him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny through the whole meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kept staring at my little group of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a city council meeting, they do,
they're, they have a little structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their agenda meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have like a little,
they say the pledge of allegiance and they
[SPEAKER_02]: pray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, they open up the floor and
they say, they do public comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right after that, they say,
thank you, or they do city contributions
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: They called it, they call it public forum
where anyone from the public can speak for
[SPEAKER_05]: five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they have council commentary
right after that, where any of the council
[SPEAKER_02]: members, there was a part right before
that where the lady goes, this is the part
[SPEAKER_02]: where we would normally say thanks to the
people that have contributed to the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week we did a hundred and one,
luckily there are none this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: My little group chuckled and I go,
huh, no shout outs on the episode this
[SPEAKER_02]: week was what I said because I thought
that was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Mike said, after that,
they let each council member speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first council member speaks and
he's like, so first off, I want to say
[SPEAKER_02]: thanks to this person and this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I chuckled a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next one is like, I want to say
thanks to this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So five people in a row go and they all
basically did shout outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the fourth one, I giggled,
I giggled out loud and the girl next to
[SPEAKER_02]: me, Angela, Angela giggled and then Adam
leaned over and giggled and we were all
[SPEAKER_02]: just like church giggling and Angela had
the balls to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes, shout outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just couldn't even handle ourselves
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eva Montoya wasn't at this meeting,
but her little council commentary for most
[SPEAKER_05]: of the meetings is it's blander than any
advertising you've ever heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's almost a bulletin board
reading session for a bunch of random
[SPEAKER_05]: local events.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, her shout outs are always come to
the Pinewood Derby or come down to the
[SPEAKER_05]: softball game next week, or we're doing an
East side park cleanup, like super duper
[SPEAKER_05]: simple shout outs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of fun to watch every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council does some shout outs,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 20 minutes of solid,
like a big shout out to, and one,
[SPEAKER_02]: one person goes, and also thanks to make
it parks and rec and kept going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, ah, they just shout out
parks and rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it like a real shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're there watching, it's,
it's a play, like anything you would buy
[SPEAKER_05]: tickets to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just about stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's usually really boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: This may get me in trouble, but it's
really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if I should say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to address the president of city
council as madam president.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not required.
[SPEAKER_05]: The city staff do it out of respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you call your very condescending
tone, very condescending tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of them were like, yes,
fucking madam, fucking president was like
[SPEAKER_02]: what they should have said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I owe a dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I owe five dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't going to stop you earlier because
you were on a roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody count them up guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody count them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pay that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: $5 per episode on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promised it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: May have to, may have to come after
nature's green remedies gets a refill,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's been quite a bit of
controversy and like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: friction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose you'd call it between the city
council and city staff and members of city
[SPEAKER_05]: council.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of months ago, the council
conference, the commentary thing was like
[SPEAKER_05]: the polite is fuck you.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have ever heard one of the city
councilmen was in the paper saying stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: two or three of the other ones was doing
was illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he kept using the phrase shadow
government and like they were ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I seriously was waiting for him to
rise up with ice picks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like as soon as they cut the camera feed
one night, the cameras are gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step, step, step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was sitting in a seat where I could
hear the whole production crew too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really a privilege to be in a
nerd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like loving tech gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see all the sound equipment and I
could hear the camera crew behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one door between me and them and
you could hear them five, four,
[SPEAKER_02]: three.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just neat watching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked those seats for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted a picture on Instagram of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was on the, I was on the news and
someone's like, dude, you look paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually that facial expression was when,
uh, the city council president announced
[SPEAKER_02]: her resignation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the face I made.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the moment that that picture was
taken.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe they used you and Angela
is the reaction footage for that shot
[SPEAKER_05]: though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the whole room went, and they were
like, Oh, get the dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy I work in the camera was one of my
best friends from high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We played in a band together in 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, he knew me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He walked up and said, hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fun being in the council
meeting and a newscaster in a suit walks
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the same newscast.
[SPEAKER_05]: They tried to get an interview with me
after probably he talked to you for a
[SPEAKER_02]: minute during in there, but you were,
you were kind of, you got shooken up,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a little nervous right before you
speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go in tunnel vision mode so much,
but it's sorted by default.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the guy that has to stand up and
speak because I've got the squeaky clean
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the college education.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the good vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've got the dreadlocks in the beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to talk to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they stared me down just sitting in
council.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I would've walked up there to them
while you got five minutes and they
[SPEAKER_02]: would've pulled out their phones and just
started tweeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I'd have went up there,
they'd have been like, eh, we're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to let the guy with the felony come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let, let the security stand up a
little closer, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So city council meeting, uh, Mike went and
spoke against the proposed ordinance that
[SPEAKER_02]: was coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we, uh, you want to tell us how that
went so that I don't have to fumble
[SPEAKER_02]: through it?
[SPEAKER_05]: The proposed ordinance is still sitting at
the planning zoning level.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are what's called a recommending
body.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they suggest things to the city
council and the city council can run with
[SPEAKER_05]: that idea or have them amend that idea in
some way, or they can kill it all
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, usually city council tells planning
and zoning, like, Hey, we'd like to see
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they go work on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my understanding that this is not
that kind of ordinance.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something planning and zoning has
been working on as their own effort to
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of show city council as a way to
solve some of the complaints they've been
[SPEAKER_05]: receiving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, essentially planning and zoning is
fired up because people can see and smell
[SPEAKER_05]: pot and, uh, that's bad as far as they're
concerned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would like to come up with rules
and regulations so that no one ever sees
[SPEAKER_05]: or smells pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're trying to grow your own
marijuana or know someone that is,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can see how problematic that might
become.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got to get it all the way back
out of sight and out of mind, and you
[SPEAKER_05]: can't do that in your own home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the problems with this ordinance sort
of spin out of control real rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, we, as far as the community goes,
I think don't like it on every,
[SPEAKER_05]: every part of it is bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so we tried to rally up people
with the last episode and a couple of
[SPEAKER_05]: other things to get down to the meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this time we had a pretty good show of
support at the city council meeting on
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I spoke during public forum and sort
of pleaded with them to think about how
[SPEAKER_05]: many people in the city that are effecting
with these rules, how many people's rights
[SPEAKER_05]: under amendment 20 or many, amendment 64
would be restricted by these rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, now all of a sudden you've got
roommates trying to figure out who gets to
[SPEAKER_05]: exercise their constitutional rights and
who doesn't, because you can only exercise
[SPEAKER_05]: so many of them at one time in a home with
the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike showed up with statistics and counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told the city council, how many
patients there are in the city and county.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told them how many of them have a
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told them how much it costs to make a
facility like they're required.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the people that spoke at city
council, the city council kind of gave
[SPEAKER_02]: them the look of, yeah, we've heard this
before and you're back again this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when Mike spoke, they all kind of sat
up and they actually leaned forward and
[SPEAKER_02]: listened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was paying more attention to their faces
and just listened into Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: It, uh, they like it when I speak,
a number of council members have told me
[SPEAKER_05]: like, thanks for having like some data to
back up what you're saying or taking the
[SPEAKER_05]: time to read the entire article.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get a lot of rambling at them and
like angry ramblings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rambling and you know, you're fired up and
you're passionate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, I'm not a big fan of public
speaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me incredibly nervous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, we did our best to calm me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said I'm nervous as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just started talking to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, what do you think about bacon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to focus out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, but somebody's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been the one that's been biting
that bullet lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went down Tuesday night and said my
piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, like usually when people
bring supporters down for their issue,
[SPEAKER_05]: like lately when the, the trash haul,
their speak, there's like five or 10 trash
[SPEAKER_05]: haulers behind them that really take a
minute to cheer and clap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as soon as the whoever's gotten up to
speak is done speaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I half expected, what were there six
or seven people behind us?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say there's about eight of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight plus us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't sure how well I did when I get up
and I start giving a speech, honestly,
[SPEAKER_05]: I go into a weird little zone where I know
what kind of what I'm saying and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: prepared to say, you know, something
specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once I get up and I start giving a
speech, honestly, I go into a weird little
zone where I know what kind of what I'm
saying and I'm prepared to say,
you know, something specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once I get up and start talking,
there isn't a filter between like brain
[SPEAKER_05]: mic and mouth mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nobody being like, don't cuss or
make sure you emphasize this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too much adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you realize what you said at the end?
[SPEAKER_02]: You stood up and he said, thank you for my
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he walked away from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's the perfect example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my heart's pounding so fast and
there's so much adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew what you meant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you meant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You meant, Hey, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you don't have time to Google this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by coming out and showing support and
by you speaking, and there was another guy
[SPEAKER_02]: that went to another meeting who spoke
about his family and how this was
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting them in such a traumatic way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys make a difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we all make a difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it's been curbed for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Monday we had a city meeting or
starting Monday or since Monday,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've had a city council meeting,
a planning and zoning meeting,
[SPEAKER_05]: and a county commissioners meeting at each
one of those three meetings.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were discussing rules that would take
away your ability to grow in your own
[SPEAKER_05]: home, limit the amount of plants you're,
you're growing to an arbitrary number that
[SPEAKER_05]: they just picked.
[SPEAKER_05]: They decided, ah, that ought to be enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll cap it at 12 in the city or 16 or 18
in the county.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and if you live up in Bula and have
400 acres and all of that's one property,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can only grow 18 plants there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter how many different
residents are set up on your property and
[SPEAKER_05]: none of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's just really terrible
rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the community kind of tried to rally.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did the podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another community meeting at the
daily grind.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another one tomorrow at four o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone wants to come on Friday,
this will go up until Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nevermind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, you guys didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we were waiting on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to go back in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all dabbed and started thinking this
was live.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can put this out tomorrow if we wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we just have to record another one for
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, the progress we made to get
everybody that could make it made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that, um, felt like they wanted
to speak, spoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I met the, the gentleman who was
quoted in the chieftain who he's a young
[SPEAKER_05]: guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a little younger than me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say he's maybe 25.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a wife who's sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a mother-in-law who's sick and
he's got a child with cancer and he's
[SPEAKER_05]: their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a job where he can't consume.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's just taking care of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And his testimony, I mean, it was like,
I was throwing spit balls and he rolled up
[SPEAKER_05]: in a tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they, they heard what I had to say at
all three meetings and they appreciated me
[SPEAKER_05]: coming down and saying my piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when he got up and spoke, they hit the
brakes hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll see you opened up for this guy
and he was the headliner.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the headliner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's come of your guys's work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they stop it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they hesitate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to rework it?
[SPEAKER_05]: The county is, they delayed the vote again
to do more research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think for two weeks, maybe three
watch the county commissioner's website.
[SPEAKER_05]: They post their agendas on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, um, their meetings are usually
Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get about five days to check it out
and a heads up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the city has the planning and zoning
mission commission delayed presenting this
[SPEAKER_05]: plan to city council by two months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have given those that came to
speak at the planning and zoning meeting a
[SPEAKER_05]: seat at the table while these rules get
reworked.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a couple of us that came to speak
against, and a couple of people that came
[SPEAKER_05]: to speak for, we'll be sitting at the
table while these get redone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I kind of wanted to ask
you about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said at, at when you address city
council, you actually said, guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: please find somebody that knows what
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do this, you looked them straight
in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, you guys don't know anything
about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please find somebody that knows what
they're talking about and put them on your
[SPEAKER_02]: committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost considered volunteering or asking
you how I get to be a part of that because
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a legal grower and I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a black market guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can set a good example.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more than once I've fantasized about
being able to like kidnap and hood a
[SPEAKER_05]: member of city government and like sneak
them through your backyard and be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is what it looks like when it's done
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what legal looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what following the rules looks
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because unless you've blown your house up
or you've set your garage on fire or
[SPEAKER_05]: overloaded a transformer behind your
house, they've never come to your home.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Mike's main point to city
council.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the guys you're messing with are
the not the medical caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are commercial growers that are
making a weed crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making those rules to enforce upon
medical caregivers and you're totally
[SPEAKER_02]: missing the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they caught on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got more time to deal with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on that committee, work it out,
let them know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a handful of us that are
scrambling.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're listening to this show and you
are interested in cannabis advocacy,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can find me on Twitter, Nemopunk15,
just like it sounds, N-E-M-O-P-U-N-K-1-5.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just created a Facebook page with
somebody else at one of the meetings
[SPEAKER_05]: brought up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be great if we had a Facebook page
where we could kind of kick out community
[SPEAKER_05]: activism and info and organize people for
when the meetings are, because all of that
[SPEAKER_05]: can be very confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're in an anti-Facebook mood,
but I feel kind of bad because I spaced
[SPEAKER_05]: the name of the freaking Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't remember your own Facebook page?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure it's Pueblo for Sensible
Cannabis Laws or Cannabis Regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember how I worded it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw it the other night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that's close.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a DAP right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one in Arms Reach.
[SPEAKER_05]: My memories are further than they should
be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me cut you off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that for the listeners this might
sound like if you're out of state or if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're out of Pueblo, you're like,
oh, man, these guys are just talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: hometown stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys got to watch those city
councilmen wherever you're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: A, local politics is interesting because
it's the stuff that most affects you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you should be kind of keeping an eye on
your local council anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And B, if you're trying to legalize
marijuana on any level, getting the people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are elected right above you is the
place to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was more what I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that there's probably some people
who are like, ugh, because I know I was.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just wanted to say- I was speeding
them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was speeding them up, didn't you see me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept rambling and I throttled them a
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were cranking them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throttled you a little bit, trying to
get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, a little throttle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike mentioned we're in an F Facebook
mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had 5,000 Facebook friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had close to 7,000 to 10,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pay attention to the number.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were about 7,000 to 10,000
followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Facebook decided to close my damn
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat it, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Clint over there with the Fs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So charge him the five, not me,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't overcharge me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't confuse the voices.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Facebook, dude, come on, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why'd you do that to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not on Facebook as much as I used
to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to go look for Mike's
Facebook page and then I log into Facebook
[SPEAKER_02]: and all I can do is look at shit that
people that have liked my shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really go comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't like, I can't post.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can post, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't let go comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And half the fun of being on Facebook is
being a troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't go troll people anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you won't see it on Facebook,
but check me out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pug Love for Sensible Cannabis Laws is the
page that I created.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're rocking out at like eight likes

[SPEAKER_05]: We're happy about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not on there yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I figure it'll be about a year or two
before it starts really rolling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as soon as it does, they'll take it
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give them the password.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are on Facebook though,
check out Wild Cousins.

[SPEAKER_04]: We do comedy in Pueblo and Southern
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild Cousins on Facebook.

[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough commercials.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like doing the commercials in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like overload them at the start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think listeners should read.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to a lot of podcasts like I
do, I like that you break it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get off that subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some more commercials.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like watching TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned to do them at the beginning like
Rogan does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer you don't, but if you want to,
you can just skip right through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just go about two minutes in,
you're right past all the commercials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rogan's five minutes unless he gets on an
on it fucking tangent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look on my table, I've not been
paid for this yet, but there may be in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered Nature Box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I approve of Nature Box.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not sponsor the show in any way
yet, but that shit's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good serving sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been replacing my sugary desires with
something from Nature Box, and I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: better, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: My teeth aren't going to rot away as
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guts aren't going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to get diabetes,
and that shit is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't go to the store and buy that
because at the store, this sounds like a
[SPEAKER_02]: paid commercial, dude, but this is the
truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the store, there's chocolate covered
this, there's chocolate covered that,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's crispy this, there's... Oh,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the chocolatey one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when Nature Box sends you a box
of like, there was tomato, basil,
[SPEAKER_02]: covered almonds in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's crack one open.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, can you use that box?
[SPEAKER_04]: Listeners, don't go there yet because
we're going to get you a promo code on the
[SPEAKER_04]: next episode because this is our promo for
the commercial for Nature Box.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am not sponsored by these guys,
but it's such a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about taking care of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just reached in and grabbed a random
delicious... This one is called Coconut
[SPEAKER_02]: Cashews.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll all have a couple of Coconut
Cashews.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll eat on a podcast like for Joey Diaz
or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm not Ari Shaffir.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to mouth fuck the fucking
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear he got a comment from a
listener that said, I'm not going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: you tonight because you chew on Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was on Diaz's podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This should sound great on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, while I take a couple of them,
I'm going to... Right before, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint came to the show because he wants to
talk about not professional grade weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I'm not a pro and your weed
kills me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm seriously like, I'll take one
hit of a bowl and that's good for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even right now, I took one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys saw how minimal I took of that
one and it's fucking me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I got all quiet when you were
talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm level with you because it's too
strong, too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only been smoking for two months.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need rocket fuel yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I need fucking... Give me that
unleaded shit, that 309 fucking...
[SPEAKER_04]: Number 85 fucking... The 85 octane and not
the turbo boost?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do not put nitrous in my fucking...
So you don't want to take a half gram dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not touching dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys, but you can go shove it,
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put that hot meal in your ass,
boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, is I'm getting like a
huge high off of one hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we've said this since before I
was smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: We said start slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if I think here in a couple of
minutes, like it didn't hit me well
[SPEAKER_04]: enough, I might take another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing that today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to work tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the thing is I need to know how
do I get my hands on some like mediocre
[SPEAKER_04]: weed unless I'm growing or finding it in
the ditch somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: My smart ass answer is just go to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look at all their jars and pick the
one that smells like hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you need something more high in
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, STHC would be beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not alone here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a ton of people that have either
avoided marijuana because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: legalities or, you know, for whatever
reason and are now walking into a
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary going, hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, they've... Rookie Cookie is the
product name that sticks in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an article about it at the
Denver Post not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that an actual Colorado product?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that is a product that's
sitting on Colorado dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_05]: not to shout out something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a spectacular name, the Rookie
Cookie.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I walked in as a 55-year-old dude into
a dispensary and hadn't really consumed
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis ever and I saw Rookie Cookies,
I would like clap and laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have Rookie Weed too?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're starting to stock it in a
number of dispensaries from what I
[SPEAKER_05]: understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: The demand is huge for... They want
regular weed, not... Back in the day...
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to be 21 to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get all these kids turning 21
and they're like, well, it's legal now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go out to the bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can join the military.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go smoke some pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just, I don't want kids starting
like with some goddamn Bruce Banner
[SPEAKER_04]: that'll fucking knock me on my ass or that
Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll kick my ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll set you down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like four hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm just like, all right,
I guess I'm going through the cosmos right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom used to...
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to smoke occasionally, not to bust
my mom out, but back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: my mom's fucking hippie, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to smoke weed back in the day and
she slowly quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she hasn't smoked for years now that
she's got a good job and shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I joke with her every occasionally,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you want to smoke joint,
mom?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, I would, but your weed's
too damn strong now.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, the last time I smoked with
you guys, it was just hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a pothead, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I remember when I was little,
her and my uncles would hang out and smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: joints all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now she's like, nope, that weed gets
me too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my uncles are the same way too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to be, that's where I learned my
shit, was from my uncles that were
[SPEAKER_02]: potheads and party animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're like, dude, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That weed's too good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's too good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and then you're going to get those
guys that used to smoke eight joints and
[SPEAKER_04]: not get high back in the seventies because
it was dirt weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they come and they're like,
well, shit, I can smoke a whole joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I even be worried about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have zero tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden they're thinking,
oh, this is going to be the same thing as
[SPEAKER_04]: that fucking dirt weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go home, roll a joint, take five hits
and get halfway through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, by then it's too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colorado rules, the laws say that
they're supposed to have every product
[SPEAKER_02]: tested, even the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they should have a THC level printed on
the jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the shops aren't complying.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not enough testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we get to that point, you need
something like closer to 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you've been smoking is in the 20
range, 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown herb that's tested in the 27.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence actually hit 29.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that was Rhian's rhino from seed that
Spence grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the fucking Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also shout out to Steep Hill Halent Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones that test our stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, yeah, they did a good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what I'm getting at is like,
there's just like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I guess that was more of my
question was like, is there a strain that
[SPEAKER_04]: you would recommend to a newbie?
Flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: FLO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I threw it out real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just happens to be the one that I
reused to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still got the flow around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is she still around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a perfect high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice, it's like a 50-50 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cut that I have is, I feel like it's a
50-50 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not too overpowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a good body high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a good head high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, it doesn't hit me hard enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost got rid of it, but a lot of my
friends are like, dude, you've got to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: the flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flow is what I liked for days for a long
time when you've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff to do, but can't be in pain all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd roll up a little flow for the morning
and I'd be good all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't near as powerful as what I
wanted for evenings, but maybe like some
[SPEAKER_02]: roachies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jilly bean might be good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something to maintain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I'm not trying to get all
fucking blasted and go take a nap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I got to do laundry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like speaking of laundry,
these cashews, was that almonds or
[SPEAKER_04]: cashews?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coconut cashews.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are delicious, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature box all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I set them down because I wanted to have
one at a time because I loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm a guy who has listened to
Rogan's podcast and everybody's podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: that says, oh, go get nature's box.
[SPEAKER_04]: This converted me right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go home and if I can remember
and not be high, I'm going to fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: order me some.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get the munchies and you'd be like,
oh, I should order nature box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what was the name of that thing that
we were talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why doesn't that episode come out already?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear Rogan and Diaz talking about it all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Nerdist even promotes nature
box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did a free thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, if you order now,
it's free.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a free box.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pay anything for this box of
munchies that were eaten.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came straight to the door,
but now every month I'm going to get a box
[SPEAKER_02]: for 1995.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like proactive, but I think
it's worth what I would go pay nature's
[SPEAKER_02]: box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they used to sling crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the Columbia house of snacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: First one's free.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted everybody to know we all,
we were all going to stop for a second and
[SPEAKER_04]: eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was just like, no,
dude, this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve nature box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, a nature box.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening, contact me for a
sponsorship because I support your product
[SPEAKER_02]: and it would work well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that awesome ad we just did?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we actually just pumped you up a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been recording for a long time and
Mike has some news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're going to put Mike on again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back by popular demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try to keep everybody awake while he
talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So save me a couple of minutes to read a
couple of listener comments, but tell us
[SPEAKER_02]: about the new cannabis news that you were
telling me about when you first showed up
[SPEAKER_02]: to the house, the local profits and such.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the, the local Pueblo city budget came
out this week and the city seems to think
[SPEAKER_05]: they're going to get 500,000 worth of
marijuana taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the, the actual city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But wait for the punchline.
[SPEAKER_05]: The punchline to that is, is the,
the number that they're going to get next
[SPEAKER_05]: year is zero, not 500,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's zero instead of 500,000 because
we don't have any marijuana businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually have to actually have to have
a marijuana business located in your city
[SPEAKER_05]: to enjoy taxes from those businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Pueblo County has already made
about 500 grand this year between the rec
[SPEAKER_05]: shops and the medical shops, the local tax
and the little kickback that the state
[SPEAKER_05]: sends on the statewide tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've looked most of city council in
the face recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem like an intelligent group of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they predicting this money comes
from if we're not allowed to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary?
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the city management manager puts that
budget together and hands it to city
[SPEAKER_05]: council.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the meeting we saw the
other night.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're probably looking at it,
thinking the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone in Pueblo that read the chieftain
today and the three of us are thinking is,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, if it's really zero, cause we don't
have any marijuana businesses,
[SPEAKER_05]: where's this 500,000 number?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I heard him.
[SPEAKER_02]: The irony in that is I honestly,
I rarely go to city council meetings and I
[SPEAKER_02]: will now I'm an anxious person and I felt
intimidated to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've broken the ice and I'm not afraid
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see me there more often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind me where I was headed with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right at the beginning, one of their
first things was, and we're proud to
[SPEAKER_02]: announce it last week where our budget was
like $484,000 or a million dollars short,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we've presented to you a balanced
budget this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things we fixed in
our work sessions, but they didn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: present a balanced budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that they just revealed their secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: They added in $500,000 that they're not
going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm a little worried about is if that
500 grand pot number was in there before
[SPEAKER_05]: they carved out the three and a half
million or whatever that they carved out
[SPEAKER_05]: over the last week, they might've been
four million short and they only filled
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole three and a half million worth
because they're pretending there's another
[SPEAKER_05]: half million that's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weed man's ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but you have to have a pot
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they would let a couple of dispensaries
build within city limits, the licensing
[SPEAKER_02]: alone is 300 or I think it's like $3,000
for one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each license you have to have several,
depending on what you're doing is five
[SPEAKER_05]: grand to the city and the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's essentially 10 grand to do just to
grow, 10 grand to do the store,
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 grand to do the hash making.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they open five shops, they'd make 25
G's right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city's already taken in about five
shops would be 50 G's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you mean, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem with that though is what
they're worried about is that you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: just allow one cause that's a monopoly and
you can't just allow five cause that's
[SPEAKER_04]: still a monopoly in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't say, Oh, you got here too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the American way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This town doesn't really need more than,
and this sounds ridiculous coming from me,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if a shop did it right, three or four
shops would be more than enough for this
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, but that's, that's on the
businesses to decide later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh, you know, I don't think we can
make money by starting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're going to get influx of
five.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden it's going to be
like, wow, we're, we're, we're all not
[SPEAKER_04]: doing great, but this guy's not doing well
at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he closes down and it's,
we're going to see that one of these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see the first pot shop
closed down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be like, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if a liquor store goes out,
we're like, Oh, we get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a liquor store on every,
every corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Single-handedly cleaning up the airwaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but what I'm saying is like,
we see a liquor store on every,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's a bar on every other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see all these liquor stores and a
liquor store goes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, Oh yeah, of course it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's super competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's going to happen with weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so prices go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prices are going to have to start dropping
and that's better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's in Washington right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking at $60 and change for a
gram of legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: The look you two just gave me is the look
that you should have given me because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're paying $60 for a gram of
marijuana, you need to slap yourself in
[SPEAKER_04]: the face with your own penis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to listen to a good podcast that
teaches you how to grow and provide your
[SPEAKER_02]: own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you need to go to naturesgreen
remedies.com and use coupon code helping
[SPEAKER_02]: hands and order yourself some freaking
high grade seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend iri genetics, gauge green
genetics, or maybe some alpha chronic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually watched what you're talking
about with pot stores closing and the
[SPEAKER_05]: price dropping with medical over the last
decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when January 1st that the whole
clock reset, they just wound it back to
[SPEAKER_05]: 2004.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pots back to 450 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this place that's got $60 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that because of a supply and demand
thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the shops in Washington,
there's a very few shops that are open.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their supply is extremely limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't have the time to bring in the
crops before this all went live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like with the licensing, you weren't
allowed to grow for very long before shops
[SPEAKER_05]: were allowed to open.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they just haven't had any time in a
year or two when shop numbers have risen
[SPEAKER_05]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Production numbers have had a time to come
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that will change a bit,
but it's going to be a year or two before
[SPEAKER_05]: you can buy a reasonable gram legally in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle has no idea what's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a little secret right now,
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some good shit coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they deserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited and I'm proud for Seattle and
for what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super excited for who we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really disappointed that it's
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make the announcement closer to the
start of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we've got some cool news for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of cool stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really our announcement to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we'll have we'll have those
people on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike, you got your news out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint, you got to ask about, well,
we didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to find some shitty weed,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to bring you some.
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought me some good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's the thing is I'm always
constantly afraid of like whatever I get
[SPEAKER_04]: to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is this going to kill me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is this the one that sends me into
like a panic or something like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, unfortunately, so far, you know,
I've gotten really fucking high and it
[SPEAKER_04]: hasn't like I haven't had like this huge
bad trip or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're probably not going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's the thing is I can talk myself
out of them because I know I'm on drugs
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, no, but I mean, as high as
you're getting, it probably feels that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to be able to remind yourself
that cannabis can kill humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been my mantra when you're too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're just killing cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got cancer for shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your cancer is too high also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going backwards going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not cancer anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just starts dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making all of that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff is not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly, surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't, you would never have
guessed.
[SPEAKER_05]: This does not count as a medical opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Clint is talking about getting too
wrecked off of like a bowl of too good a
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last night I did a gram dab and I
honestly have not been that high since I
[SPEAKER_02]: did a half gram dab recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it took me, no, you remember on the
show when I ate that 350 milligram edible,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was nearly, I was equally high,
but in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like red eyed and stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was Chinese last night after that gram
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I ate that edible, I was,
I felt like I was on energy drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was jumping around and giddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't jump around like there was no
giddy last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to giddy up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I keep saying giddy, what are you up
710?
[SPEAKER_02]: I bumped into him on chat roulette and it
was really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had his pants on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stoners and people jerking off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's two dudes staring at each other,
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: While I was about to hit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we both came on and we go,
Hey, because we recognized each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I held up my rig and he held up
his rig and we both started laughing like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, taking dabs on chat roulette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everyone else has their wiener out on
that channel and it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're into online chatting with other
stoners, there's a thing called puff puff
[SPEAKER_05]: chat that I've heard about in a number of
places, but I haven't actually attempted
[SPEAKER_04]: to enjoy trying to keep up with somebody
who just set a TV to fast forward just to
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they're just dogging on these fucking
things and you're like, Oh, I can't keep
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this, this little tiny chick is
kicking my ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no tolerance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be, I'd be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love puff puff.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was called puff puff chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time I got online for something
that was designed for stoners to come
[SPEAKER_05]: together and get stoned on webcams
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got shut down like an hour after it
started.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like the DEA showed up and we're like,
what are you all doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Videoing yourself committing crimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: This sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't prove it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And uh, oregano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Facebook page used to say, this is all
an illusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: We live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do live in Colorado and I take dabs and
I've got the legal allowed amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't give a shit right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to start wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're close to an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you got any plugs or any shit to
wrap the show up with?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a blank stare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint, you start thinking I should have
had some notes about when the next
[SPEAKER_05]: commissioner meeting or when the next city
council meeting is, but uh, I don't guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you are a cannabis supporter in the
city of Pueblo, Colorado, the County of
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo, Colorado, please follow Mike
Nikon, not like a Nemo punk, Nemo punk 15
[SPEAKER_02]: on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an icon is what it comes up under the
name there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's confusing and I'm not just a little
soft Mark, but at this point I'm proud of
[SPEAKER_05]: a handful of my followers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a couple of major news outlets follow
my retarded ass and I don't want to start
[SPEAKER_05]: over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to kind of bear that
Nemo punk 15.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find him on there because he will tweet
when all of the meetings are, he's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council meetings that we need to
go to the commissioner's meetings,
[SPEAKER_02]: the planning and zoning meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it feels like there's a cannabis
presence needed, Mike will start tweeting
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff out for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start retweeting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a little community action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tall Clint will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your turn buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find me on Facebook and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tall Clint's Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all, I just stuck with the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to brand it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tall Clint.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm tall and I'm Clint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you don't think it's Cliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like another word the first time
I saw it on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not look like it said Clint.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no N in the words you're thinking
of or- There is an N in the word you're
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're thinking of when the L and the I
become a U.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like the L and the I had united
to a U.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was going to be in my name,
it makes complete sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I thought, I think I said that
word on the show earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may edit that word out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never said that on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say the F one, but that one,
that's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're not trying to offend people
and people get offended by that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a charity, hit Ross to Jeff
up to take another cuss word out of this
[SPEAKER_05]: vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, since everyone's doing plugs,
check me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I no longer have the iReGenetics Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So follow at iGrowCulture on Instagram and
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: iGrowCulture has a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you can follow me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started posting dab videos and weed
pictures on at Rasta Jeff 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was hard to say for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a couple of shout outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: People left me some really cool comments
on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for leaving the iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: This first comment is from Hippy Nurse
710.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up Hippy Nurse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having a rough day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope listening to the podcast and
hearing a shout out makes you smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a rough job and I appreciate
what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a nurse at night, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I have so much respect for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't know how much respect I have
for it, but maybe she will now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her comment says, and she gave us five
stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her comment says, I have been a listener
since episode one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear a difference in the tone,
quality, and flow of each episode as you
[SPEAKER_02]: progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are getting better and better
with each episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you keep it light and
informative.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it easier for newbies like myself
to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks a lot, Hippy Nurse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for listening since episode one.
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to always, she would tweet me and
message me like, when is the new episode
[SPEAKER_02]: coming?
[SPEAKER_02]: When is the new episode coming?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, it comes out at 7,
10 in the morning on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, I work nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it come out at 4, 20 AM?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now it comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it pops up kind of randomly
late at night on Sundays so that she can
[SPEAKER_02]: listen to it on her Sunday shift at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she sent us a nice comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works out well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're doing well, Hippy Nurse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we need some more five stars guys,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've got another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy, Billy Bob Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charles Manson.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not just from Oregon or South
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a Bobo Shanty Rastafarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: All possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or his middle name could be Bobo also.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have the same problem I have
with a bad handle though, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says, Rasta Jeff is fun to listen
to, but be prepared for some stoner
[SPEAKER_02]: moments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where was this conversation going and
what were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey dude, that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Award winning hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Award winning flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he was being disparaging on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he was trying to be like,
here you go guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're aware sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't take offense to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's accurate shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the fun of the whole thing
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have sometimes random shit is where the
good shit comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to script almost everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to type out like a lot of what I
was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I listened to the episodes and it
felt like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for listening to Microculture
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I write like bullet points and try
to rant on those bullet points and keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: moving because it feels a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that does create those stoner moments.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's he doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were saying you were going to keep
reading this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's, that's what he wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gave us four stars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's cool enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four works.
[SPEAKER_04]: I passed middle school with a 60.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thanks for leaving a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Bob Bob Ray.
[SPEAKER_05]: We apologize for butchering your name
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high and making it fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not butchering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got me entertained as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we had any where's this
going moments this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this whole episode was a where the
hell is this going moment?
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like Jeff was trying to drag me
back to the point like for an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just not an hour, but you know,
there's a couple of good minutes in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I hope you heard me trying to put
him back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got on Nature Box for at least an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those fucking almonds were great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already sold that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fixed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish that I could get my nature box at
high grow into a growing supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap this up guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Jesse coming back in a couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if he'll be back this week or
in about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's hard to get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a busy man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's married to work several jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's worth waiting for, but we're going to
discuss building your grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, a listener said that they have a
$500 budget and they would like to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow a small grow room to supply
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of good ideas on how that
might work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to work on that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put an episode together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of news articles that I
did not read on this show, so they'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read that part that I read at
the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
