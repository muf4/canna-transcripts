[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A one camera episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching the video, there's only
one camera today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are figuring out what the technical
difficulty is with the other camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get two cameras up and running
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just purchase another camera that
may end up with sometimes three angles,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes two angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am already rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to start by saying thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I asked a lot of
people to, I asked for people to subscribe
[SPEAKER_00]: to the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get to 10,000 subscribers on
YouTube before the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people subscribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people shared that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who subscribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everybody who already was
subscribed and big thanks to everybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: shared my request for subscriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that big push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an increase in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you for all of the feedback in
the YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been checking out the comments a
little bit more previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about not reading those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been making an effort to browse them
a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see that you guys prefer the longer
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the longer episodes myself,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when the camera does crap out,
the longer episodes are still more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a minute to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do the ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do the intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to read the Patreon stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get settled in, I really like
flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that I enjoy the longer
episodes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to get longer episodes
coming to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes short, sweet episodes are good
and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get right to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the lesson out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say I ramble too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want longer shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make the show happen the way
it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do my best to make everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be super ramble-y through
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking all kinds of different
dabs today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't blame it on one dab or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of miles on the car,
did a lot of things, smoked a lot of dabs,
[SPEAKER_00]: saw a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm ramble-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of talking happened today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not ramble too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did all the ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I covered all the Patreon stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a message here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want their names set on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend,
Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy, Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, the email
address is growfromyourheart at hotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where this one came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend, Zach, says, hey, Rasta Jeff,
I started listening to your podcast around
[SPEAKER_00]: a month ago, and I am so appreciative of
all the information you give out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I need is to hear that people
are learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it all worth the time,
effort, energy, knowing that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning something that you learned enough
and felt like you should reach out and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're learning a lot that I'm
connecting with you, so thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching, listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it, and thank you for the
great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've always wanted to do a small
breeding project in my little three by
[SPEAKER_00]: three tent, and I'm still trying out new
strains before I really go in to a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But years ago, my buddy and I grew for the
first time, and we got our hands on some
[SPEAKER_00]: bog genetics, big up bog genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some bog bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace to bushy old grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, big rest in peace to bushy old
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys ever see the name bog or the
letters B-O-G in a grow forum or on a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: forum or wherever you're getting seeds,
bog B-O-G is bushy old grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a really cool grower, a really cool
breeder, kind of a cantankerous old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as cantankerous and outgoing and
ornery as subcool, but he still had some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't as outgoing online on the new
types of internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day on IRC and stuff,
he did talk a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already rambling, but bog is bushy old
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught us a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave us a lot of great quality strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did make a lot of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Mrs. Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend is talking about doing some
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still searching for some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still getting their black belt and
growing before they get into breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then their first time they grew,
they got their hands on the bog,
[SPEAKER_00]: bog bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, they've been hooked on all
things bubble gum when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and love trying things that are
crossed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bubble gum turp and that bubble gum
effect is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything from, I'm not sure if the bog
bubble comes from the old Indiana bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't research that, but anything from
that Indiana bubble gum or true bubble gum
[SPEAKER_00]: line is tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that super stickiness to it,
which actually is why the bubble gum got
[SPEAKER_00]: its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't from the flavors or the aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because it was so sticky that it
was sticky like bubble gum is where bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: gum got its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend is thinking about or talking
about doing some breeding in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in love with the bog bubble and
all things bubble gum and bubble gum
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where we get into the question
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do not require a large quantity
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do decide to create some seeds,
I am purely looking for that euphoric
[SPEAKER_00]: giggly creeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Creeper high that I remember from bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, what is the best way to
select keepers in a breeding project if
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only looking for specific effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, should I take small samples late
in flower or decide purely based off the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell of the turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to completely finish
your test samples, dry them, cure them and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking, if you're judging
your phenohunt based purely on looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: the euphoric giggly creeper buzz,
you've got to grow them to full maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry them, cure them, smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things have to happen under
the same scientific type conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you're in a three by three
tent, which actually kind of makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: better because that three by three tent is
gives you much less variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got that much space to have
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get your three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow as many seeds as you can fit
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as legally I do them small,
grow them until you can get a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: get your clone, then grow them all
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them all the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them all the same amount of light,
air, humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the three by three is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your variables are going to be limited in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to grow it, harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can harvest them at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until you see the trichomes look the
way that you would normally harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait till you feel like each plant is
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest them, dry and cure them the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like, I noticed that when I
smoke, if you guys watch any of my live
[SPEAKER_00]: shows or if you know me, you know that my
office space is my favorite little smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a huge computer screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite music is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My drink goes right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dab rig is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like my home base.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get home and want to chill out and
take some dabs and put on some music and
[SPEAKER_00]: relax, that is the first spot I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a nice cozy computer chair,
chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like my test zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going to test new dabs,
new cannabis, that would be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place I would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite smoking device is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite music is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My comfortable chair is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My snacks are within reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that is my zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get wrecked in that zone and nothing
can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything does go wrong, there's a couch
on the other side of the room that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically crawl to the couch and
everything will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my desired test environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had new product to test, I would test
it all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would try to test it all after a
decent meal, have some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some food in my stomach, have some
hydration, not be exhausted, not be too
[SPEAKER_00]: hyper, not have any caffeinated beverages,
not too much sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Belly full to where when you smoke it,
you're not going to get instant munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some blood sugar to handle,
something to handle the blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you take a couple of dabs,
take a couple of smokes, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: however you bong rips, pipe rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the cannabis into you,
see what it does to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give each sample that same kind of
critical test sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it in your favorite device,
in your favorite space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed if you smoke in your
little, your comfort space, you can smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and enjoy it really comfortably.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste every turp, smell every
smell, because you don't have to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to like if you're smoking
somewhere, perhaps in the car or at
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else's house, at somebody else's
house, maybe the dog is going to knock
[SPEAKER_00]: over your drink or spill the bong or you
can't really focus as much on what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're in your perfect little bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say smoke all of the samples in
a scientific sort of format with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline sort of starting point,
full stomach, no sugar, no caffeine,
[SPEAKER_00]: clear head, good mood, nothing to do and
see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if that's the one that gives you that
giggly, euphoric creeper bud feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If what you're looking for is specifically
that effect, you've got to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: finished product that gives you that
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to really test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking early samples won't tell you what
you're going to have in a final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to smoke a final finished
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to know what you're
going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a short term goal is to
reproduce that giggly effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to F2 these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to F3, F4?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far do you want to go in your
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just want to make a few seeds for
yourself to play with or do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a whole bunch of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you just want to make some
for you to breed and grow out and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you find that giggly stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says any advice would be greatly
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to pop some strawberry
starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see what these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All about cheers from Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, strawberry starburst and that bog
bubble would be really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will find similar bubblegum type
terps in the strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's strawberry candy, there's
strawberry bubblegum, there's watermelon
[SPEAKER_00]: terp in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow the flowers out, and what I
have noticed, this is my experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you grow the flowers and press them
into concentrate or where they,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, grow the flowers, wash it and then
press the washed concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grow it and make bubble hash,
then press the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tasted like strawberry bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I did notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get some strawberry terps,
bubblegummy terps out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an ideal when you breed with
the bog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use a bog bubble male or
are you going to use a bog bubble female?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have in mind here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow, I would try to use that bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost just make F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just doing this just for fun,
for your own personal enjoyment,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would find the bog male that looks and
smells a lot like the bog female you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to grow a pack of the bog
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can get more of those seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be ideal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or hopefully you've got a clone or
something of the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, try to find some of that bog
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a female that gives you the traits
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find one in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the pack the first time that you
grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find it in the pack again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the giggles, the creeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is the effect right there that
you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Giggles, creeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something else but my printer kind
of messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Euphoric is the other word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find those traits from the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male that looks similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be limited on male
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the best male out of the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that looks a lot like the
girl you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a male and you've got a
girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would also find a couple of other
female plants to put in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like the strawberry starburst
would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I would find something vastly
different than the bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to see what that bog is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the bog bubble is contributing to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed it to something really cushy or
gassy or garlicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can see what it contributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it change the structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it change the aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it give you just a bunch of mutants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make it really resistant to bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: See what that male is adding by breeding
it to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of course you've got to grow those,
but that is the best, the funnest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I don't know, that is a big debate
in my head right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you know how to get in touch with
me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, do you enjoy the phenohunt
and growing more or do you enjoy smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: it more?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love growing it and seeing what
happens to the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I made the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you make a breeding project,
this is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a breeding project and you make
seeds, are you more excited about seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: what the plants do as they grow or smoking
the final product?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I'm torn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really, that's a really big
question for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lost my place rambling on that one,
but I would find that, yeah, then you get
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow them, then you get to smoke them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male, find a female, then find a
couple of other females and put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room because that dude's going to be
in there skeet skeet and blowing pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just put a couple of females in there
for him to pollinate, make it a party,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a bunch of different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep all of those seeds separate when you
harvest, then grow them out, mark them so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know this is like strawberry
starburst to the bog and then this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever to the bog and this to the bog
mark them, grow them, see what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like I said, identify the trait
that that male is delivering to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if he's, if the bog F2s come out
bubblegummy and euphoric and giggly,
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit your goal right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the strawberry starburst,
what did you get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make the strawberry starburst go
super tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make it short and squat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make it get a sour maybe a
grapefruit kind of an aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit it to an indica or a garlic
plant, does the garlic come out more or
[SPEAKER_00]: does the structure of the original plant
you pollinated come out or does the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of that male plant come out a
little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to identify the traits
when you do the breeding to see which side
[SPEAKER_00]: which parent came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would take the boy, I would take the
girl, take a few other girls and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: party in there, grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the most important part again is to
finish them, let them finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I stuttered so strong
when I said that, but I must have meant
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them finish, then harvest them,
dry them, cure them, just like you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally do, just like you do all of your
other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it scientifically, but don't dry them
and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: No anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do any new experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I tried this because that may fuck up
all of your science.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try one new thing that could mess
everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the familiar shit that you do,
but keep it very regulated amongst every
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry them, cure them, smoke them,
see what you enjoy the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are breeding for potency and
effect, that is the way to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also keep in mind that if you're
growing this, you're going to want plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it shaped well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that plant support itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it grow in your growing style?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you grow in three,
you're in a three by three tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're not in gigantic pots,
but I don't know if you grow hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow soilless mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow in a seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow a six inch net pot or a three
gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow one big bud and cut off all
the branches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you trellis them out real far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use a tomato cage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use a stick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using yo-yos and hanging them from
the ceiling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as crazy as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds different than what it looks
like if you're not familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: yo-yos, but how are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you're growing in there,
so find the phenotype that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to find the phenotype that
works best for the hot, for the cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the humid, for the dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that takes a little
bit longer to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you handle that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you freaking out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like, this plant needs to get done
already?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like, man, I got all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that plant fucking finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love letting plants go for a long time,
so do you want the faster finisher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the longer finisher?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many variables to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about bug resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want these plants to be really
resistant to bugs or does that even matter
[SPEAKER_00]: to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you care if they are resistant to mold
and mildew or do you not even care because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the only one growing those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I make seeds for market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I make a lot of seeds for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys see these strains pop up
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, where did those come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why were those never for sale?
[SPEAKER_00]: The garlic goat was made just for me to
play with and then I made so many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was like, I'm never going to grow
all these, so I put some of them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: let some people get their hands on those,
but if you're just making them for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could breed for just potency,
just for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breeding for things that go to the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to be pest resistant,
pathogen resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely no mutants, no intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to be very careful what I put
out, but when I'm making stuff for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be really problematic and I can
find the keeper for myself to grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what you're going to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like these are just for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got that three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to grow gigantic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find, this is something I was
talking about with a couple of friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are like, I just don't have room to
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had room to grow and breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed in a very small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your three by three would be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying put that male plant and
several females in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pollinate in a three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably hypothetically put,
I can fit nine three gallon pots in there
[SPEAKER_00]: easily in a three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pots may be touching, might not be a
lot of space, but I'm thinking nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: three rows of three, three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the dude in the middle, surround him
with ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he starts pollinating, all those
girls are going to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's eight female plants in there that
you get to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to grow them very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go even quicker and not
make a big mess and get a bunch of pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a huge project, you can breed in
small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done beer cup breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't tell everybody about this as a
seed maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't tell you how to make seeds so
quickly, so easily, but this is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy, effective way to make a few seeds
just for yourself to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make seeds, the first time I make a
cross, let's say that we're going to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's pick a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say Jack Tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real thing that has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Tripper is lemon skunk to Jack the
Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come and dance on our floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The song will be stuck in your head all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to come and knock on our
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll never stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where Jack Tripper came from on the
story when the question gets asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Tripper, lemon skunk, Jack the
Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it Jack Tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing lemon turps, lemon cleaner turps,
almost gross, overpowering lemon cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the head buzz, it's like a knife just
came through the ceiling and ripped your
[SPEAKER_00]: head off and opened your brain in half,
and lights and fireworks just come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your brain for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The head high is so extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, let me focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only made 70, 50-something seeds of
that, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a small drug bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many seeds I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about,
a little drug bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many seeds I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot, because I don't know,
I didn't know, I do know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, I didn't know if that was
going to be completely intersex plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: complete mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know if they were going to take
74 weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know if they were going to be
duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what it was going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of wasting time vegging a plant
that it was going to get real big,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all, a male plant that gets real
big makes a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that I'm lazy, but I don't want to
clean up a whole bunch of pollen if I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's minimal pollen, that is less to
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew a smaller male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in a six-inch net pot, because I
wanted him to be kind of bigger than the
[SPEAKER_00]: females, because I want enough pollen to
get the room there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got my male in a six-inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my females in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pollinate a bunch of beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow them to where they're just big
enough to, I don't know, four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: inches, maybe three and a half inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time the pollen hits, they're only
maybe eight inches, 10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they're done, they're 10,
or they're 12, maybe 14 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to put a skinny stick in
there just to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from that plant, you're going to get a
lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, like 30 to 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds probably, and that's plenty for just
a home grower or a home breeder to tinker
[SPEAKER_00]: and play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys buy a 10-pack and you spend good
money on a 10-pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get 30 seeds and you do that to
four or five plants, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 100, 150, 200-something seeds to
play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that in one very small run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small, just a very tiny
space that you can control the light to
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, 12 for six weeks, nine weeks on,
there are some variables in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said six weeks, because you can put the
light back to a vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds will finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But six to nine weeks that you can control
a flowering cycle, two or three,
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four weeks, you can control a veg
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can produce seeds that will be very
viable, usable for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got rambly on that one, but you don't
need as much space as you think you might
[SPEAKER_00]: need is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pollinate little tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be super large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them in a beer cup, veg them until
they're as tall as G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll end up two or three G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe's tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have 30, 50, maybe even 100 seeds
in there, depending on the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush stuff doesn't make a lot of big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get a lot of seeds out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mac doesn't take pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mac is just stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be stingy, Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then things like strawberry starburst,
they'll take a lot of pollen and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffle, blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of seeds when you
pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper crosses make a lot of
pistols very early and produce a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can hit those really early when
they're little and produce seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I got rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more notes on this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for the effects,
you definitely have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to find the potency that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other way to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here is the last note that I did
write on this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says if you find the right keeper and
the one that gives you that giggly buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: and that euphoric high and that creeper
effect that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it necessary to do any breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got the plant that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could you could just be happy with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the desire, the need,
the want, just the excitement of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, if you've got the plant that
does what you need it to do, you don't you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really have to go any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just clone it and grow it
forever and ever and be completely happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could or you can ask one it you could
self it and make more seeds of it than
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got those seeds forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a male plant,
if you don't have any seeds, if you do of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bog, if you do have the clone of the
bog, you can reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use that as your pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can pollinate another clone of
the bog, you can make s ones of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're doing that, you can also
put that pollen on other female plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: outcross it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the previous episode, self and
reverse plants, you can make some selves
[SPEAKER_00]: and some reversals using the bog keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to read again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always wanted to breed years ago,
buddy group the first time got our hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I've looked, I've loved all
things bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've still got it, you can self it
and then you can make a self cross of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can out cross it if you still have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I would recommend trying to find
another pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you said you're growing the
strawberry starburst, you're going to find
[SPEAKER_00]: similar bubblegummy terps in there,
you'll find creeper, you'll find euphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer may lie in that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend, Zach, I do want to
thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did get me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like talking about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like looping it back to previous
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more quick question I'm
going to cover here in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend,
Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Kyle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I have a question
about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know you recommend to be in the
6.2 to 6.5 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually would say 6.2 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.4, but 6.5 in like a soilless mix and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'll work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I completely understand the
reasoning, but I'm curious why Kana
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kana is a nutrient brand, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm curious why Kana recommends
as low as 5.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kana is a nutrient company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on their website, most of the nutrient
brands that you buy do have a website with
[SPEAKER_00]: a nutrient calculator, a nutrient feed
chart on there, a nutrient schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients is starting to become the new
row ads in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what I'm talking about,
big up shout out to Chris Farley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so they're a nutrient company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell bottled nutrients and they do
recommend as low as 5.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did check their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk minimally about pH because I am
not an organic chemistry expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are up taking buffered
nutrients in a bottled nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking up bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking up the 16 elements,
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum, while you say that one fast,
calcium, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more that I'm going to miss,
but I'm going to try to keep on moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are trying to uptake those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those things to be bioavailable to our
plant, the pH of that feed solution needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be around 6.2 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nutrients are more bioavailable to
the plant at that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets higher, the plant doesn't
uptake that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets lower, the plant doesn't
uptake that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we recommend a 6.2 to 6.5 is
because there's a range where some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients would take up better at 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them would take up better at 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go right in the middle to where you get
just the best for both of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using so many things that we just
found that within that 6.2 to 6.4,
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.5 range, you do get a good window where
most things will work best together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the scientific terms,
like I said, I'm not an organic chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: major, but that's where things seem to
work the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason that they are giving you
such a broad range in this proprietary
[SPEAKER_00]: brand, I did, yeah, and the rest of the
question says, recommends 5.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe they say the highest is 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something proprietary to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is proprietary to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some research on their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 5.2 is recommended for hydro,
for DER, they recommend a 5.8 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for cocoa, they recommend 5.5 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the hydro, there's nothing buffering
those nutrients from touching the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they give you just a little bit lower
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just straight to the nutrients,
straight absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lower pH works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no soil to buffer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to work through,
nothing in the way, straight to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be quickly absorbable at that low
of a pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly am not super experienced in
hydro, but it does kind of make sense for
[SPEAKER_00]: the little bit I know about plant growing,
organic chemistry, and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the 5.8, 6.2 in the DER is because of
the buffering of the DER, the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DER there does give you a little bit
to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make that range a little bit more
available for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, I keep saying the word
buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get a little more room to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we recommend soil and soilless
mix to new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is a little bit easier to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soil kind of works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil kind of corrects your problems a
little bit to an extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you can just go pouring in a
bunch of shit, but it does kind of help
[SPEAKER_00]: you correct the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you fed the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil will do some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The living shit inside the soil will do
its things and help correct what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done a little bit and make that available
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to get a lot of messages
about what I just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an organic chemistry major.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to explain this the best I know
how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said I explained things like
people have never grown before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people never have grown before
and that's why they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says 5.5 to 6.2 in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're getting that low 5.5 in cocoa
because that is very close to hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a hybrid of soilless mix,
hydro together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you can go so low in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically nothing buffering, protecting
the roots, just cocoa in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa is basically inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we could talk about I wrote down
phase and medium and plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certain phases, your plants are going
to want different pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In different medium, your plant may want
different pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that some of the cookies crosses
like a lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the more sativa dominant stuff
likes a higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, if you're in certain
environments, you want to adjust pH to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of compensate for some things that
may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why there are recommendations in
many of our range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back onto the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back in track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, this run, I followed
your range and I feel like my plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have your testers hitting my flower tent
next and I wanted to get your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see your testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're going to pay a lot
of good attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, as a side note for this,
typically when I mix my nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: it hits about 6.3 until I bump up the feed
and midflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it consistently sits at 5.8 until I
adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably feed them that 5.8 and
they wouldn't be angry, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: liking what you're seeing, I wouldn't
change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to make changes
because of numbers and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the plants, the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're liking the results, don't change
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, thanks for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've helped me improve my grow by leaps
and bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't thank you enough, your friend
Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me, knowing that I
have improved your grow leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, those kind of compliments,
that type of feedback makes setting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: camera, makes having a frustrating camera
that keeps turning off on me and draining
[SPEAKER_00]: a battery and doing weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These comments, this type of feedback
makes all that shit worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that camera makes me want to
throw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even mad at that camera anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't even bug me that I got these
bright ass lights in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that I'm making your garden
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that I'm making your
growing experience better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing should be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing should be pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing is like my Zen zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do work in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get paid for that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm in my own personal grow,
I close the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put in the earbuds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm just listening to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I just hear the fans and the
blowers and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relaxing the sound of a vortex fan or
a hurricane fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just another oscillating fan
coming by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those sounds, it's like a,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: ASMR, AMSR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the right order, but it's
like music to my ears sometimes here in
[SPEAKER_00]: those fucking sounds in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hear the air conditioner kick
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a pretty good imitation of the
air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll run for a few minutes and then it
cycles off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love being in there and hearing all
the rhythms of the shit and knowing it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all working smooth and smelling the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like being in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my Zen space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fuck with me when I'm in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave the phone outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in that's on the charger somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's go in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my Zen space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that I can make your grow that
comfortable for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your getaway like mine is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vacation is in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go do some defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go do some cloning, some topping,
popping, lollipopping, twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go stare at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like my meditation right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm glad I'm making your grow as
enjoyable as mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, newbies and
[SPEAKER_00]: pros, smokers and growers, clone cutters
and pollen chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.

ramble on another episode of the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did have a good time on this
episode, even though I only had one camera
[SPEAKER_00]: to ramble into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get camera number two repaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure out what's going on with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like I said before, I'll buy camera
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we've got a backup plan when
camera two decides to be a little bitch
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.

corrections, comments or concerns,

this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap it up while it was nice and
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my
buddy, levity love day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama hug for me.
