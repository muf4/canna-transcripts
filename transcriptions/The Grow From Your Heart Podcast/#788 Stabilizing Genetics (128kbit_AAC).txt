[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Internet World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 789 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I'm going to give away a
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've teamed up with our friends at
SeedsHereNow.com to give away a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of irie genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will teach you how to win that free pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I want to talk about
stabilization in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has come to my attention that a lot of
the cannabis world, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture and growing world,
does not exactly understand what the word
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilization means when it comes to our
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, I see people post to the
Internet that they got a pack of seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: they discovered intersex plants within
that package of seeds, and they will
[SPEAKER_01]: attribute that to what they call unstable
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that may be part of the problem,
but that is not exactly what stability
[SPEAKER_01]: means when it comes to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the plant world, in the horticultural
world, in the botanical world,
[SPEAKER_01]: stability means that if we grew out a
large batch of seeds, that we will not see
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple phenotypes in that population,
that we will see stability, that all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those phenotypes will be uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you drive through a farmland state,
one of those states where there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of corn, maybe Nebraska, maybe you see a
bunch of soybeans, maybe you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: through Kansas, as you drive down the
road, you will notice that every single
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those corn plants looks exactly the
same, and all those soybeans look exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you're going to say that's genetic
modification.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably part of it, but also that
is breeding for stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants have been bred to be that
phenotype, to all be stable because we
[SPEAKER_01]: can't run.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got acres and acres of corn or
acres and acres of soybeans, you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: have some corn that gets really tall,
some corn that stays really short.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it easier to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it easier to basically maintain
and care for that crop, and it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting and processing much easier if
everything is uniform, and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: customers, the clients, the people buying
that produce, the corn, the soybeans,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever produce, they expect uniformity
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So uniformity is basically what we're
talking about when it comes to stability
[SPEAKER_01]: in the botanical world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's talk about how we achieve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creating a stable line is all about
selective breeding and good breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing is starting with
quality plants, plants that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: stress tested, plants that have been
through the ring, or plants that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: are quality breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we are breeding cannabis,
if we're breeding corn, if we're breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: soybeans, whatever you are breeding,
one of the most important things to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about is the starting plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have quality starting material?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start with a plant, let's just,
I like to refer to cooking and baking or
[SPEAKER_01]: being in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start with ingredients that don't
taste good, your food will not come out
[SPEAKER_01]: tasting good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put more crap and more crap in a
pot, no matter how much you cook it,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much you stir it, how much you bake
it, still going to taste like crap in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding is the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to start with quality plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't start with crap plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't start with intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't start with problematic plants,
or guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to breed more intersex
problematic plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is all about selective breeding and
selecting quality plants to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I said that one of the most important
things to think about when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding is starting with quality plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another very important thing to think
about is having a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to create?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your goal with this breeding
project that you are working on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if we are going to work it to
F4, F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: If our main goal is to come out with a
strain where every seed looks the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't it be a good idea to start with a
solid goal with a solid idea of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: want?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of the most important things
to think about when it comes to breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: are starting with quality plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing I always talk about
having in mind is breeding with a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to create?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's say we've got two plants in
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know they are good breeding candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tested them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that they are not intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that they handle stress well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that they handle environmental
change as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that they're pest and pathogen
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we kind of have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's write down a solid breeding
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we breed these plants together,
we're going to see a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions through the different filial
generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make a guideline now of what we
are looking for so that the plants don't
[SPEAKER_01]: throw you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll grow the plants and then you'll
say, you know what, I want to go this
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to mess up your breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay on the map that you made in the very
beginning and make that other direction a
[SPEAKER_01]: B project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that at another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe simultaneously if possible,
but draw that roadmap and stay on your map
[SPEAKER_01]: because the plants like to kind of give
you ideas and throw you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your friends are going to give you
input and the internet is going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you input.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow the original idea and get to where
we are going and see how we can do that
[SPEAKER_01]: with the map that we've drawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on we'll learn how to
branch off and do other side shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's stay focused if we're trying to
make a stable line here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about stabilizing these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you've got a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way that this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I would also recommend
at this time is starting with plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: are completely different from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants that are too similar to each other
just breed more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find something that maybe has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk specifically about my cross
Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise was a very successful cross because
of this factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a golden goat female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me describe golden goat to you very
briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat is kind of known as a tropical
sativa, but it also grows short and squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a really nice sativa kind of
head buzz, really tropical flavors and it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes really skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't get super tall like most
sativas and you can harvest it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more early than most of the other sativa
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come down around week nine,
which is a great trait for a sativa kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of buzz type of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got those skinnier leaves,
that tropical flavor, that sativa style
[SPEAKER_01]: buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I took a daybreaker plant,
which is Joseph OG and Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: That puts off a lot of gassy chemicals,
burnt rubber, fresh tennis ball kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: smells and aromas completely different
than that tropical sweet candy in the
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also put off big gigantic leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are so big on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also makes a lot of crazy purple
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew that those were completely
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bred them together to create
something brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, in my experience,
it worked very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I'll recommend at this time
is start with plants that are very
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can find a male and a female that
are very far apart in traits and flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma, growth structure, I think that is
when you have the best success in creating
[SPEAKER_01]: new lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that in mind, we've got two
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they're vastly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, your breeding project will work
with your goal if you've got a goal in
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have more fun when they're way
further apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got my male, I've got my female.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a breeding goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the first thing to do is chuck some
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put some pollen on this female
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This batch of seeds is called the F1
generation, the first filial generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are brand new seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never been made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from that F1 batch of seeds,
we will grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay very close attention to what you have
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any intersex problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there mutants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there freaks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have germination issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are these quality plants that you're
enjoying the outcome from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like growing them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they grow well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they handle problems well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing the phenotypes that you
were hoping for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So grow those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would recommend now is finding the
phenotype that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you wrote down your goal,
you said, I want to find this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a plant that grows with this
shape, this structure, this flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: time, this flavor, this aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to work in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people run a scrawl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people run a big wide open plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people top them one time and let them
bush out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people only veg them up six inches
tall and flip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the seeds that you made work for your
grow style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you find the phenotype that is perfect
for your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, let's continue with this breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not finding the seed that you
want, the plant that you want doesn't come
[SPEAKER_01]: out of there, then this is not a
successful breeding project, which is not
[SPEAKER_01]: a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have been in this for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep those seeds and then pollinate with
different plants and different females and
[SPEAKER_01]: try it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until you do find the cross that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every cross will be a winner every
single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely might not be what you're
looking for the first time you make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point here, make that first filial
generation, grow them out, find the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that is exactly what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to do very careful selections at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to find exactly what we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find a male plant and a female plant
that have got the traits you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, the leaf shape, the plant
structure, the node space, the type of
[SPEAKER_01]: branching, does it react well to what you
want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the girl in there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also find the male plant in there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now guess what we're going to do again?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to grow the boy, we're going
to grow the girl, and we're going to chuck
[SPEAKER_01]: some pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now making the F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F1s now just bred together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these F2s are going to show you a lot
of crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phenotype variation in the F1 won't be
as wild as the F2s, but you'll see a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the F1s, you're going to see plants
that look 50-50 like the mom and dad,
[SPEAKER_01]: some plants that lean more toward the mom,
and some plants that lean toward the dad,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you'll see some weirdos in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the F2, we're going to see plants that
look like the mom, we're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that look like the dad,
we're going to see plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere between one and 100% the mom and
the opposite the dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could have 50-50, 60-40,
70-30, either direction, mom and dad in
[SPEAKER_01]: this batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we're going to see grandparents
represent themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever was used to make the plants that
you use, the parents of those plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to pop up now and they go,
hey, here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the great grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the grandma you forgot about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the grandpa that you forgot about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to pop up and say,
what are these weird traits?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to go, why are the plants
doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from grandpa on either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got four grandparents and two
parents that can represent themselves here
[SPEAKER_01]: on this cross at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you're going to see some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just took the whole genetic gene pool
and put all of the traits in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: every color of eyes, every color of hair,
every type of skin and teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine we just shook it up and
we're going to get some weird looking
[SPEAKER_01]: cousins out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going to see in the F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is your job in that F2 generation to
find the plant that has the traits you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the plant that is perfect to continue
this line.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one that is going to represent
the next line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got to be the perfect plant for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have, I'm going to keep saying it,
the leaf size and shape, the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, the internodal spacing,
the branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it finish on time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it react well to what you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it does, that's the one that you want
to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that female, find that male,
then guess what we're going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for them to get it on again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make the F3 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this F3 generation, this is where we
start doing a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have gotten rid of that F2,
the wildness out of the F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F3s are starting to lock in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to see a little bit more
uniformity, which is the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what stabilization is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we going to do again?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to grow out these F3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to find a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to find a male, like I keep
talking about with the exact perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: traits that we wrote down, the goal that
we are seeking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to find that plant once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not in there, that's not a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back and grow more of those F2s and
find those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to go all the way back to the
F1s and make F2 again, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never be afraid to go backwards and run
more of those old seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not have found what you were
looking for because you might not even
[SPEAKER_01]: have known what you were looking for at
that time, or maybe it just didn't pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's run that F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's find the perfect one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to pollinate that F3 with
another F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to make F4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're getting super close to
stabilizing this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, you should have probably 70
to 80 percent of your phenotypes looking
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly uniform if we have done the
selection properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the only way to tell if we are
doing this properly is to grow out large
[SPEAKER_01]: batches of these seeds, grow out as many
as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see a thousand of them if
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that that is not possible for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm spoiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here in Colorado where I've got access
to commercial grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got access to a lot of friends that
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give them seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually rent space from my friends
who are no longer growing and grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: their grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm renting grow space from you and I'm
producing seed or flower in your space,
[SPEAKER_01]: big up and thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does help me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend a thousand of these seeds if
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that's not possible for most
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe do a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I understand that that is not legal
for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say follow the rules where
you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get yourself in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, you're a fucking adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to keep myself out of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't run a thousand or a hundred
seeds at a time, you probably can run ten
[SPEAKER_01]: at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you run ten of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe run ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the best one for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set it in the corner and keep it as a
keeper plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then run nine more and just keep doing
that until you just eliminate a few until
[SPEAKER_01]: you are satisfied that that is the one
that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ways to phenyl hunt large batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just may take more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I was at F4 when I got off on a
rambly tangent there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from that F4, we're going to do the
same process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to find the plant that has the
exact traits that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be easy to find by now because
by this F4 generation, we're seeing a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are starting to really stabilize
and settle in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to find that female that
looks exactly like all of the traits we
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowering time, the growth structure,
the node spacing, the branching,
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf size and shape, colors,
aroma, we should be smoking all of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you found out if it's got the buzz
you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have the turps you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the perfect plant for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that F4 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, by this point, you should be pretty
good at selecting male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But find that male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them do some pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, you've now created F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this F5 generation, we're going to see
really uniform plants among this
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the plants are going to look
very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now reaching our goal of
stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, if you grew 100 seeds,
you should probably get 10 plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't fit in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other 90 are probably going to
look just like each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the next step, obviously,
if you want to lock this in even more,
[SPEAKER_01]: is to go to the F6 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't know any breeders that
go to the F6 or beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps DJ Short is hitting the F6
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the last I read when he was selling
seeds, he would take them to F5 and then
[SPEAKER_01]: stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way he would leave us room to breed
to them, because if he goes any further,
[SPEAKER_01]: it locks in all of the traits that he
created, that he selected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we breed to it, that's all that's
going to come out as those traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's all that's left.
[SPEAKER_01]: That segues me into the next part of
talking about breeding and stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can accidentally stabilize negative
traits if you don't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Negative traits could be intersex or
whatever you're not looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is in your population of breeding
anywhere, if you see that and you pass
[SPEAKER_01]: that on in the breeding, you could
stabilize a negative trait that you
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you grow a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you do a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you grow every batch,
a large population of every batch if
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, and select the best plants from
that batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were seeing any problems,
maybe go backwards and breed from other
[SPEAKER_01]: batches and select better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you just selected the one that
carries an intersex trait or one that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't speed up, doesn't flower quickly
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back and find better plants if
you wanted to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could also back cross for one of
those better generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that's super close
in the F4 generation, you could take an
[SPEAKER_01]: F1, F2 and pollinate that with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll give you the traits you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my advice is to keep going forward and
keep making it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you make a mistake, go back to
where you made the mistake and then move
[SPEAKER_01]: forward from there again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a second ago, I did mention back
crossing, which leads me into another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I would like to kind of ramble
about for a minute here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about breeding, sometimes I'm
thinking about locking in traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing I'm also thinking about
is washing out traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's talk a little bit about washing
out traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I want to use back cross as
a kind of a guideline for this is because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really easy to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll understand it if I use back
crossing as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk quickly about what a back cross
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll make sense of all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say I've got a plant,
we'll say golden goat, because I've done
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want golden goat seeds,
but I don't have a male golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't make regular golden goat
seeds without making feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: or without adulterating that golden goat
plant in some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would do what I did is I
pollinated the golden goat plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: another plant, like I said before,
a plant that was vastly different than the
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This way I could identify the traits and
the progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pollinated the golden goat with the
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, I could see those big leaf
shapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see those skinny leaf shapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew right away that all of the skinny
leaf shaped plants were the golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bigger leaf plants weren't even
necessary to keep around for the back
[SPEAKER_01]: cross project because those were the the
daybreaker dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now if I want to make a back cross of
this golden goat, my idea is to wash out
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those traits of that daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do I wash that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: By simply breeding the golden goat to the
golden goat multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's basically like adding more
layers of paint until you can't see that
[SPEAKER_01]: daybreaker in there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I did that was I took the
golden goat and the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got my first cross, which is
golden goat to daybreaker F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, I found a seedling,
a male that looked just exactly like the
[SPEAKER_01]: original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took that male, and I pollinated that
original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've taken that adulterated golden
goat pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's half golden goat, half daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've put it back on golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm basically minimizing the ratio of
amount of daybreaker traits in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to make the golden goat
back cross one.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, we grow out a batch of seeds,
and I'll find another male that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly like the golden goat from that
batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put that pollen back on the
golden goat again and make yet another
[SPEAKER_01]: batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now do you see what I'm doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Each time I add this golden goat to the
mix, I'm just washing out traits of that
[SPEAKER_01]: daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just washing out those negative
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something, another thing to think in
mind, another way to approach breeding is
[SPEAKER_01]: by thinking about what traits do you want
to wash out and what traits do you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring along with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know I gave a lot of ratios,
a lot of fractions, and a lot of numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all good in theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things to think about is this is
all plant theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you write down these ideas,
write this all down, it will look really
[SPEAKER_01]: good on paper, but we've got to keep in
mind these are plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to do their own thing
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics will do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do alial charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could write Mendel charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do your predictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do our favorite selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes nature is just going to
throw a curve ball at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of a guideline.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a quick course on how to
stabilize and what stabilization means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind when it comes to cannabis
plants, there will always be variables
[SPEAKER_01]: because nature always finds a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature always wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my report on stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say at the start of this podcast,
I was going to give away a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that free seed giveaway is
sponsored by my friends at SeedsHereNow
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friend James Bean at
SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also big shout out to the entire crew at
SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know none of that would happen without
everybody on the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big crew they've got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the whole team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love working with those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fist bump to seeds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I tell you how to win seeds on this
episode, I do want to announce the winner
[SPEAKER_01]: of the last episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the way that you won seeds on the
last episode was by signing up for my
[SPEAKER_01]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have selected a winner, but I don't feel
that it is fair to read your email address
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the podcast because I don't want
you to get a bunch of spam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you won the free seed giveaway on
the last episode, I have reached out to
[SPEAKER_01]: you via email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do respond to that email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your shipping address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a real name in that, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you win seeds, when you send me your
address, please put a real name on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like putting like Ganja Joe's Weed
Farm on a package that I'm sending to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody with seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, that just looks shifty for
the mailman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then second of all, that encourages
people to steal your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plenty of people are stealing the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they see like Joe's Weed Farm or
Ganja Joe or Ganja Bob or Stone or Dave or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever on the package, that does
encourage theft.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just lets them know there might be
something smokable or consumable in there
[SPEAKER_01]: or enjoyable in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that does encourage them to steal
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't get your seeds stolen that you
won because that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have to send them to you
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will get an email if you won from
the last seed giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I've got your email address
because you did sign up for the mailing
[SPEAKER_01]: list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, if you would like to win a free
