service going for everybody and big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to everybody who wanted to remind me
that the show was late that is my point
[SPEAKER_00]: here it was up on YouTube on time so
technically we were not late at all I did
[SPEAKER_00]: have something to show that I really did
do a podcast it was there we did a
[SPEAKER_00]: premiere on Monday on YouTube I hope you
joined us and if you didn't join us for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next premiere every time I do an
episode I do the premiere it is Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: night at midnight or Thursday night at
midnight it's actually Sunday night
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling into Monday or Wednesday night
rolling into Thursday that's when I
[SPEAKER_00]: premiere the episodes is at 12 o'clock
midnight mountain time I don't know your
[SPEAKER_00]: time zone but join me in the mountain time
I know why do I do it late at night
[SPEAKER_00]: because that way the podcast is there for
everybody in the morning and I can still
[SPEAKER_00]: stay up late that night and hang out in
the premiere I think 12 o'clock works
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully I am fucking rambling we're
gonna get out of these rambles and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna work ourselves into some emails I've
got one quick patreon message before we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about making our own silver
thiosulfate solution this message comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from patreon it comes from our good friend
girls grow to shout out to girls grow to
[SPEAKER_00]: hope everything is doing marvelously in
your garden I'm gonna catch my breath and
[SPEAKER_00]: read this message it says you mentioned
you taste in colors you may have what is
[SPEAKER_00]: called synesthesia it's a real thing and
when you mentioned it I wanted to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the show keeps getting better thanks for
all of the continued work you do cheers to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 so in a previous episode I mentioned
that I think I smell in colors and I been
[SPEAKER_00]: told that that's an official thing it
looks like I've been diagnosed with
[SPEAKER_00]: synesthesia I'm not crazy my mother had me
tested big thank you for the great update
[SPEAKER_00]: of the diagnosis I guess we can say I'm
gonna read more about that and now I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I am as crazy trust me I still
feel crazy but that's one more thing we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to worry about all right let's
get to the point of this podcast this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a short episode but I promise
you this is going to be a very valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: episode for a lot of people so with no
further ado let's get into this great
[SPEAKER_00]: question that came from our friend Joe and
it goes a lot like this it says what's up
[SPEAKER_00]: rasta Jeff I saw you on the dude grows
show before and I had to check out your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast big shout out to all of my friends
in the DGC shout out to the dude grows
[SPEAKER_00]: crew big shout out to Scotty real shot it
to the dude shot it to guru and big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to everybody behind the scenes that
makes that show happen I understand there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot of people that make that show
the wonderful production it is big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to each and every one of the people
behind the scenes as well they get
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked quite a bit big shout out to
the DGC gang I'm glad you found me through
[SPEAKER_00]: the dude grows crew it's I had to check
out your podcast thank you for all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and for keeping it simple for us
stoners I like to explain things in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody can understand some people
learn from this angle some learn from this
[SPEAKER_00]: angle I make sure to deliver my teachings
from a lot of angles I did not like school
[SPEAKER_00]: I love learning but I didn't enjoy school
that may sound redundant but I'm not good
[SPEAKER_00]: at sitting in a classroom looking at a
chalkboard or now it's a dry erase board I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess and listening to some boring ass
person drone on for eight hours a day that
[SPEAKER_00]: was not for me I understand that learning
can be totally boring for some people and
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it entertaining I try to
keep it fun try to tell a couple of jokes
[SPEAKER_00]: in there so I'm glad you find it that I'm
keeping it simple for the stoners I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep everybody involved if you're a new
grower if you're an advanced grower if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a pro grower that's always been my
slogan I try to have something for you it
[SPEAKER_00]: says I have a question about silver
thiosulfate if you recommend a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: brand also when to spray and how often to
spray and how you dilute your spray I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you said different strains will require
different solutions and intervals I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want a good starting point or a reference
to go off of thanks again big respect and
[SPEAKER_00]: of course this comes from our buddy Joe
Joe thank you for the great question there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot to talk about here what Joe is
asking about is a silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: solution which would be used to reverse a
plant that reverses plant would then
[SPEAKER_00]: create pollen and that pollen would then
create feminized seeds I have talked in
[SPEAKER_00]: great detail about feminized seeds on
other episodes I'll include a link to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other feminized seed episode in the show
notes but basically what we're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is take a female plant and we're going to
treat it with this solution that will
[SPEAKER_00]: cause this plant to create pollen sacks
which only contain female chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a true female plant we have
tested that solid it's a female it will
[SPEAKER_00]: make pollen with female chromosomes we put
that on another female plant the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that come from there are all females the
way that we do that is with a silver
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate solution now our friend Joe
asked what brand do I use there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of reversal products out there on the
market there are a lot of companies making
[SPEAKER_00]: premixed silver thiosulfate solutions
there are a lot of options I make my own I
[SPEAKER_00]: buy silver nitrate what do I buy I wrote
it down because I want to make sure I get
[SPEAKER_00]: it right I bought silver nitrate and I buy
sodium thiosulfate and separate containers
[SPEAKER_00]: they are dry powdered forms and I make my
own silver thiosulfate solution this will
[SPEAKER_00]: work on 90% of the plants you are trying
to reverse most of the products on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market are overpriced and unnecessary when
you can make your own silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: for about $13 for probably a hundred
gallons you don't need to make that much
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time you only need about half a
gallon at a time is probably the most I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever needed so you don't need to make a
lot at a time and you don't need a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: product to make it you don't need a lot of
money if you do have plants that are a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit stubborn there is one product
out there that I'm not going to say is
[SPEAKER_00]: overpriced if you've got some stubborn
plants they won't reverse that one
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal spray maybe worth the money but
otherwise I would say make your own silver
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate I'm gonna teach you guys how
to be self-sufficient I want you
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient and always so you're gonna
get some gold from me today today we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna talk about making our own silver
thiosulfate solution I'm gonna clear my
[SPEAKER_00]: throat really quickly and then we will
move forward alright excuse me I felt it
[SPEAKER_00]: was better to get that out of the way
instead of just keep doing it alright here
[SPEAKER_00]: we go we're gonna make our own silver
thiosulfate solution to reverse our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing we need is distilled water
I highly recommend distilled water
[SPEAKER_00]: distilled water is easy to get it's very
affordable it's probably two bucks for a
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon you can probably get it at the gas
station or the grocery store right down
[SPEAKER_00]: the street from wherever you are so we
start off with distilled water then like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said before we need silver nitrate we also
need sodium thiosulfate these products are
[SPEAKER_00]: both readily available on the internet a
very short Google search will find these
[SPEAKER_00]: products for you don't spend too much they
are very affordable products the most
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive part will probably be shipping
they're gonna ask you all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions some of the websites ask more
questions some websites don't ask any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions this these products could be
used for photography there is a wide range
[SPEAKER_00]: of uses for these products if they ask a
lot of questions maybe don't use that
[SPEAKER_00]: website find the website that doesn't ask
you what you're using it for find a
[SPEAKER_00]: website that I don't know where you are
find a website in your country so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to ship these products over the
border so that you get them more quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: something I'm gonna jump in this is not in
my notes but I feel like I do need to say
[SPEAKER_00]: this anytime I talk about mixing or
touching dangerous products wear the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate protective personal protective
equipment wear the appropriate personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment these products are
caustic you don't want to breathe in
[SPEAKER_00]: silver nitrate or sodium thiosulfate it's
very fine particle if you're new at this
[SPEAKER_00]: please protect yourself if you're
experienced at this please protect
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself wear a respirator maybe even some
goggles wear some gloves please protect
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself I know you're gonna say that's
extreme but I'm teaching you how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something I need to teach you how to
protect yourself please protect yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: when making these products so you're gonna
get distilled water you will need silver
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate you will need sodium thiosulfate
you'll need a couple of containers I
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer glass containers glass vessels
we're going to put 500 milliliters in one
[SPEAKER_00]: container of water of distilled water in
one container and 500 milliliters of
[SPEAKER_00]: distilled water in another container then
we're going to pour those two containers
[SPEAKER_00]: of water into one vessel of water so we
need two containers that will hold 500
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters each and we need another
vessel which will hold at least one liter
[SPEAKER_00]: of water a thousand milliliters is going
to going to go into this next container so
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that we do it the way that I do it
is I will take one half of a gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: silver nitrate I'll repeat that one half a
gram point five of a gram of silver
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate and I will drop that into 500
milliliters of distilled water and stir it
[SPEAKER_00]: until it is completely dissolved it
shouldn't take too long then I will take a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate jar or container of distilled
water this is jar number two or jar B 500
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of distilled water to that jar
I will add two and a half grams of sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate powder 2.5 grams of sodium
thiosulfate to the 500 milliliters of
[SPEAKER_00]: distilled water now I've got my jar a and
my jar B I've got my night my silver
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate my sodium thiosulfate jars that
are separate we've stirred them both up I
[SPEAKER_00]: use a butter knife to stir them honestly
because it's metal nothing's gonna stick
[SPEAKER_00]: to it it's non porous I use I use the
butter knife I pull it out I clean it stir
[SPEAKER_00]: the other one with the butter knife that's
what I use honestly then like I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: a moment ago we will take those two
bottles those two jars of solution and
[SPEAKER_00]: pour them into the one container in most
cases you would mix one into the other I
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly since my containers are full at
this time I've got a bigger vessel here I
[SPEAKER_00]: poured them both into there kind of at the
same time and stir them with the butter
[SPEAKER_00]: knife after they're poured into there now
you have got a silver thiosulfate solution
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a 100% ratio do not spray that
100% concentrate onto the plants we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to dilute that solution let's jump into
that part now we've got our one uh a liter
[SPEAKER_00]: of silver thiosulfate solution in our
large vessel this is when I get a spray
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle just a basic spray bottle I get
them from uline you can get them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar store what's that other place
harbor freight's got them all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: just a basic spray bottle you'd put a
window cleaner in it and spray the window
[SPEAKER_00]: and spray the window and wipe it down
that's the exact type of spray bottle I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about maybe something depending on
how many plants you're spraying you may
[SPEAKER_00]: want something bigger the small squirt
pump spray bottle works just fine for what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing so then I will take this is
where it comes in to adjusting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I will start with a one to nine
dilution I will use one part silver
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate and nine parts distilled water
so I'm diluting it one to nine one part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the silver thiosulfate solution nine parts
distilled water so if my spray bottle will
[SPEAKER_00]: hold a thousand milliliters I put 100
milliliters of silver thiosulfate solution
[SPEAKER_00]: in there then I top it off with 900
milliliters of clean water the distilled
[SPEAKER_00]: water then I shake the shit out of it to
make sure I've got a nice mix in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a thousand milliliters in a spray
bottle this is when we start treating the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants see how easy it was to make the
silver thiosulfate solution that's why I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want you guys paying so much money
for these products you get 500 milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: of something and you got to spray it way
often you don't have enough of the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution it's not gonna work and it was
way overpriced don't buy into those
[SPEAKER_00]: products like I said there's one product
that is worth it if you're having a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time reversing plants but otherwise don't
spend that expensive money because most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time silver thiosulfate will do it and
it's very affordable you'll be amazed at
[SPEAKER_00]: how affordable this project will be it's
like 13 bucks and you can make gallons and
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of this stuff so we've used a half
a gram of silver nitrate two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of sodium thiosulfate that's in our
liter of water it's all mixed up together
[SPEAKER_00]: we've mixed we've diluted that into our
spray bottle we've got a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of STS 900 milliliters of the
distilled water in a spray bottle now it
[SPEAKER_00]: is time to start spraying the plant let me
jump back into the message and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting all of the things you asked
for a certain brand okay when to spray is
[SPEAKER_00]: the next part of the question here when to
spray is a very important part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: equation I spray about a week before I put
the flower the plant into flower so if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna put the plant into flower on the
seventh I will spray it on the first today
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording on a Wednesday if I wanted
to flip my plants on Wednesday I would
[SPEAKER_00]: spray them on Wednesday so pull that plant
that you plan on flipping out of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do it in the room with the rest of
the plants don't think you can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: spray don't be a dumbass don't be a smart
ass take the plant out of the room spray
[SPEAKER_00]: it with the silver thiosulfate solution
spray it to run off I like to spray it
[SPEAKER_00]: till it's really running off also don't
just spray the leaves with the solution
[SPEAKER_00]: spray the stems spray the stalks get the
entire plant with the silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to get as much of the silver into
the plant the sodium thiosulfate is a
[SPEAKER_00]: carrier agent the silver actually gets
into the plant and causes the reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: which I spoke about in the feminine I seed
episode not gonna go too far into that
[SPEAKER_00]: right now so pull that plant out spray it
when it is completely dry you can put it
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the grow room then you wait a week
then we put all of the plants into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not all of them that is another
issue that you've got to think about it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take somewhere between 25 and 35
days for this plant to produce pollen we
[SPEAKER_00]: want the female plants closer to day 23 to
30 ish when they get pollen so time that
[SPEAKER_00]: out you may want to put this boy into
flower a little bit earlier get him head
[SPEAKER_00]: started or this girl that is going to be a
boy that's a reversed female is
[SPEAKER_00]: technically what it is we may want to get
him her into flower a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: early than the other females let's get
back on track with the plant we are
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying we're gonna spray a plant spray
on a week before flower day then move it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the flower room on flower day spray it
again the first day of flower so whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: day you flip the lights spray that plant
again that day pull it out of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it to run off then we're going to
spray that plant every three days so on
[SPEAKER_00]: day one day four day seven ten thirteen
and so on every three days you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray that plant I sprayed the plants
approximately seven to nine times
[SPEAKER_00]: including that first initial spray
something's clicking when I move and I
[SPEAKER_00]: apologize if you can hear it in the
recording I think it's my headphone cable
[SPEAKER_00]: it's driving me nuts I hope it's not
driving you crazy so we're gonna spray the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant seven to nine times some plants that
take longer to flower some plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more stubborn will get ten or eleven
sprays this comes with learning the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: this comes with learning the dilution of
the solution and the frequency of how
[SPEAKER_00]: often to spray that plant I wish that this
90% diluted solution would work on every
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with seven sprays but we're working
with cannabis plants we're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: living things they are picky some plants
you can spray them with a really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: solution a couple of times and they'll
reverse very well some of them you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray them a lot of times with a very
diluted solution and they'll reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: better the only way to learn this is by
doing it to the plants if you have a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have chosen to be your pollen
donor that you're going to reverse I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend taking several clones of that
plant and treating it with different
[SPEAKER_00]: dilutions of the solution treat it with a
90% treat it with an 80% treat it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: or the eight to one or a nine to one and
then an eight to two and a seven to three
[SPEAKER_00]: to start increasing the potency of your
mix or start increasing the frequency of
[SPEAKER_00]: your sprays then see how the plants react
you will see in the end which plant makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the most pollen that's kind of what we're
looking for which plant makes the most
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen the only way to really tell if this
project was successful is to grow out the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds which you produce so let me recap
just to make sure I got everything because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going kind of quickly we're gonna
spray about a week before flip then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to spray again on day one and then
every three days so day one day four seven
[SPEAKER_00]: ten thirteen continue until about day 22
ish sometimes if the plant doesn't look
[SPEAKER_00]: like it is reversed or if it's not doing
what I want it to do I will continue the
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying I'll continue to spray it maybe
nine to eleven times just depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant some of the longer flowering plants
some of the more stubborn plants will get
[SPEAKER_00]: more sprays out of me if you over spray
the plants will not produce pollen they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: simply make pollen sacks that open up and
nothing comes out they fizzle out and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants kind of dry up and look like shit
you won't get any pollen sometimes you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: spray them and immediately the leaves will
just crinkle up and look like complete
[SPEAKER_00]: shit by the time you put it back in the
grow room those leaves are turning brown
[SPEAKER_00]: you've over sprayed the plant doesn't want
that heavy of a dilution so then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to lighten it up and you've got to
spray more frequently and then you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention to those leaves sometimes
the plants don't react at all you spray it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you go I wonder if that's even doing
anything then about 21 24 days in you
[SPEAKER_00]: start going oh look it's starting to make
balls it's starting to make male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it takes even longer so it's all
about the plant it's learning that female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you were trying to reverse
we're really doing a lot to this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: we're changing the hormones of this plant
to make it do something it was never
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to do so be patient with it and
you've got to adjust to the plant I say
[SPEAKER_00]: this all the time the plants are the boss
I wish I had an SOP that I could say
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed at 90% at 1 o'clock on Friday do
it again at 2 30 on Thursday and then feed
[SPEAKER_00]: it a cookie and everything will go
magically but again these are plants this
[SPEAKER_00]: is science this is biology this is
horticulture and nature there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variables to work with here a lot of it
depends on the female plant like the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding of the female plant what are the
genetics in there if the plant can reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: too easily maybe you don't want to work
with it so make sure you've got a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: tested female very important part is that
you use solid tested genetics don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: any hermaphrodites or you're going to make
more plants with more intersex traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just going to mess up everybody's
grow nobody wants that so select good
[SPEAKER_00]: plants test your progeny and if you can't
get a plant to reverse that's when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time to start thinking about that more
expensive reversals spray you guys I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I went super quickly over that but I
feel like I covered all of the things we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to cover make the solution and start
spraying don't get the solution on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants also sometimes the silver
thiosulfate solution will leave a purple
[SPEAKER_00]: stain behind so if you're spraying against
a wall maybe you don't want that wall to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn purple maybe put something down put
some newspaper behind it or something but
[SPEAKER_00]: spray until that plant runs off then put
it back in the room once it's dry don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get the other plants wet I think I covered
it all you guys I don't want to ramble and
[SPEAKER_00]: go back over anything unnecessarily
because I feel like I repeat myself a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so that everybody can learn I do
want to thank my friend Joe let's read the
[SPEAKER_00]: email one more time and make sure we
covered everything how do you spray how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you dilute it different strains take
different solutions in different intervals
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered that you're gonna have
to experiment with the plant so I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend taking clones of the same plant
and just treating them all differently and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a lot of notes when you do that
otherwise you don't know what you did you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have anything to reference later to
see what worked for you alright that is my
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson on making your own silver
thiosulfate solution to reverse your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I hope you learned something if you
