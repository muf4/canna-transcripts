[SPEAKER_00]: many people have no idea what I'm even
talking about big thank you to everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who grabbed that merchandise so quickly
there is more stuff coming people are
[SPEAKER_00]: right now they're saying how did he put up
stuff and I didn't even know about it what
[SPEAKER_00]: is he talking about that's right there was
new merch they went on my website and it
[SPEAKER_00]: sold out you may have never even known the
way to stay updated is to join the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter go to my website most of the
way down on the website there's a spot
[SPEAKER_00]: that says join the irie genetics
newsletter and stay up to date if you put
[SPEAKER_00]: in your email address you'll get a
newsletter approximately once a month that
[SPEAKER_00]: will let you know there's new merchandise
maybe new strains being released maybe new
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon codes stay updated with the
newsletter also a discord and pay tree on
[SPEAKER_00]: heard it first so join us on the pay tree
on join us on the discord and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you sign up for the newsletter to stay up
to date with all the stuff going on
[SPEAKER_00]: alright I don't want to brag too much but
oh my goodness I'm so excited you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the restrictions have lifted it
feels like maybe possibly temporarily but
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going to comedy shows and it
feels so good big shout out to my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint we went and saw Doug Stanhope a few
nights ago not Doug Benson I do talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson people probably automatically
subconsciously heard Doug Benson but we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw Doug Stanhope a few nights ago I've
seen so many comedians in my lifetime I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge comedy nerd that was my first time
seeing Stanhope I've never seen Stanhope
[SPEAKER_00]: before I've been listening to his podcast
for probably years I've known who Stanhope
[SPEAKER_00]: was for a very long time he's always been
one of my favorite comedians he was part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the man show he was buddies with Joe
Rogan so he's been one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: comedians for a long time but to see him
live was a huge honor I've been super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited for that of course I had tickets
about 18 months ago and everything got
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed back because of I don't know what
happened some weird shit delayed
[SPEAKER_00]: everything everybody was like 18 months
late for something but it was a great time
[SPEAKER_00]: to see him he fucking blew the roof off
that building he crushed he's got such a
[SPEAKER_00]: great rhythm it took him a minute to get
into his rhythm but once he got into that
[SPEAKER_00]: rhythm he's got a really a cadence I keep
doing these hand movements he like does a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and it's that's comedy you set up a
joke and you tell the punchline you set up
[SPEAKER_00]: a joke and tell the punchline but Doug
Stanhope has a very distinct rhythm and
[SPEAKER_00]: way of talking and a way of thinking and
then he does a lot of that's a set up
[SPEAKER_00]: punchline then a couple of more punchlines
after that just the way he was doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: was beautiful and he hit that rhythm that
thing that I'm used to like when you go
[SPEAKER_00]: see your favorite band when they play your
favorite song comedians don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite some of them do but most
comedians don't repeat their jokes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: so to hear him hit that rhythm was what I
was looking for and it just felt so good
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like there he is that's the rhythm
anyway I'm just excited to be going to
[SPEAKER_00]: comedy shows again I'm excited to be back
doing stuff it is such a good time I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about that a little bit give my
buddy Clint a big shout out for being a
[SPEAKER_00]: good comedy bro a good road dog he's also
watching the podcast what's up bro go out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden and pull some leaves all
right I just wanted to talk about comedy
[SPEAKER_00]: it is so exciting if you know anything
about me that's just a little view into my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal life in my personal world here I
love comedy and it is so good to get back
[SPEAKER_00]: out and see comedy and then if all goes
well the boys from fish are coming here in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a couple of weeks so I can't wait for
that all right let's focus on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and a podcast here I did say that
I was going to read a couple of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: messages I've got a message here right in
front of me this one came from I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if they want their names said let's
let's read this a little bit we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say their name because it does talk
about a commercial grow and I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get anybody in trouble so this message
goes just like this and of course if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to send me an email the email address
is grow from your heart at hotmail.com or
[SPEAKER_00]: on the website there is a grow help tab if
you go to the website click on grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: we do ask you a few questions we ask you
about your temperature your humidity what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of lights are running stuff like that
then we will answer your grow questions
[SPEAKER_00]: from the grow help tab so grow from your
heart at hotmail.com the grow help tab or
[SPEAKER_00]: of course patreon are simple ways to get
me your messages this one goes a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: this it says what's up Rasta Jeff I hope
all is well with you brother things are
[SPEAKER_00]: great man I've been seeing comedy shows
and having a good time and it's finally
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to cool down it was 108 degrees
consecutively for a few days here
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently for a few days here and it is
cooling down so that's a great thing
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for the knowledge and love you send
out every week keep it coming bro I will
[SPEAKER_00]: do my best thank you for noticing it says
with your help and let me try that again
[SPEAKER_00]: without the frog in my throat it says with
your help and some dedication from myself
[SPEAKER_00]: I landed a commercial cultivation job
congratulations brother you did the hard
[SPEAKER_00]: work I just gave you some info and you put
it to use it says as soon as I got in
[SPEAKER_00]: there I hit the ground running your shows
and my research have really helped me earn
[SPEAKER_00]: the respect of my team and people are
always asking my opinion on things and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in general that is awesome but
kind of keep in mind and we're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: to more of this in the message here that
they hired you you didn't hire them so you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of got to go by their way but if
they're gonna they're gonna ask you for
[SPEAKER_00]: questions always have good answers it says
the job is tough though every day I see
[SPEAKER_00]: things we need to work on that is the way
a commercial grow is always going to go I
[SPEAKER_00]: see that in my personal grows I see that
in commercial grows they're always going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be things for somebody to work on
always room for improvement the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see it means that you're aware that
you're not turning a blind eye to it that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there's room for improvement
that's always a good sign let's continue
[SPEAKER_00]: with this message because I am rambly
today it says my biggest concern is that
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants are growing too quickly and too
tall I want to lay out some ideas for my
[SPEAKER_00]: boss to consider for controlling the
stretch in flower all right so the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting too fast too tall and they're
stretching in flower that makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sense then it says I feel like we are
falling let's see there's one more that I
[SPEAKER_00]: skipped we do trellising in three layers
all right that makes sense most of it I do
[SPEAKER_00]: with another person yeah it usually takes
one or two people to throw out a big
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis on a big canopy I feel like we are
falling behind a lot because of the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rates and lack of knowledge on plant work
from some of the less experienced folks
[SPEAKER_00]: all right so the plants are growing real
fast they're growing quickly with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor but you're falling behind because
the people can't keep up with the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that does make sense currently we're using
thousand watt high-pressure sodiums they
[SPEAKER_00]: hang at a set height the same goes for the
fans I told my boss I heard the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment controls for calming things
down under the dark period as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: adding blue spectrum yeah that would help
but that's not gonna help a lot this is
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a scheduling issue wind burn and
light burn are killing a good portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: our yields so you turn down those fucking
fans dude and I want to help I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some ammo for serious conversation
with my leadership to get us on the right
[SPEAKER_00]: track and have more consistent growth
patterns in our rooms I'm sure you want
[SPEAKER_00]: information so hit me up okay I've got a
good idea of what's happening here your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are just getting too tall you did
say you're using a three tier trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: system is that first one and I don't know
what you're doing in there I can't see I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't had pictures yet is that first one
kind of spreading the plants apart
[SPEAKER_00]: normally our plants want to grow straight
up we put the trellis down to kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine if your plants are growing
straight up and you came from above and
[SPEAKER_00]: just dropped a net on them they're just
gonna go down with the net right so we
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of want that effect with the net but
then we spread them out strategically use
[SPEAKER_00]: the net instead of having them grow
straight up vertically we want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them grow horizontally a little bit so we
spread them out with the net spread them
[SPEAKER_00]: out instead just going straight up you can
use the net squares to kind of bend the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant over and go over here into this
square and then it grows up that way so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can fill up your space instead of
going straight up that's a way to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter that'll help you out a lot the
second net you can do the same thing work
[SPEAKER_00]: them into that second net spread them out
with the first one weave them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: second net then they'll grow up in the
third one they'll need supports for that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be afraid to grab a branch so if my
arm is the nug that's too tall don't grab
[SPEAKER_00]: up at the wrist and bend the wrist down
grab down at the elbow and pop that fucker
[SPEAKER_00]: at the elbow and bend it down to where
it's horizontal and it will all grow back
[SPEAKER_00]: up but don't be afraid to pop it down at
the elbow area crack it low and then give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a lot of time to grow back up and curve
itself up it will grow back up but the
[SPEAKER_00]: main thing happening here is just a
scheduling issue if the plants are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: too big and too tall and they're growing
into the lights and into the fans you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably vegging for too long why not just
veg for less time you could veg for a week
[SPEAKER_00]: less and that would save you money that
would save you time that would save you a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things don't veg for so long
they're getting too tall so get them
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter you could put in blue lights that
would help you but the main main thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: to just veg for a shorter period a lot of
popping and twisting like between the time
[SPEAKER_00]: you flip and probably week three and four
a flower if you can pop and twist that
[SPEAKER_00]: will help you a lot that'll stop them from
growing vertically because they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: spending more of their time and energy
repairing what you've done to popping the
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose structure and it won't mess up
your buds they're still transitioning
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still going from the veg to the
flower stage the hormones are all changing
[SPEAKER_00]: over then like week four five and six
those nugs will really pack on but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely pop and twist them but this is
more of a scheduling and planning issue
[SPEAKER_00]: just flower earlier so my main question
that I would ask now you said that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are getting too tall the main
problem sounds like the plants are too
[SPEAKER_00]: tall they're growing into the fans and
they're growing into the lights what week
[SPEAKER_00]: are they getting too tall I'm assuming
you're running a nine probably a nine
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a ten maybe an eight week flowering
phase I'm gonna say nine weeks right we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at nine weeks what week do you see them
getting too tall is it week seven they
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting too tall week eight they get
too tall whatever week they're getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: tall reduce that many weeks off of your
veg phase so if they're getting too tall
[SPEAKER_00]: at week seven you're doing a nine week
flower phase take two weeks off of the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase we can't cut time off the flowering
phase that's not possible so we've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: just cut time off somewhere else and that
would be your veg phase and why not just
[SPEAKER_00]: get them out of the cloner get them into
pots and it sounds like you might just get
[SPEAKER_00]: them right into fucking flower at this
point get them trellised out so you get
[SPEAKER_00]: them out of the cloner get them into the
probably their final pots it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: from if you don't have a lot of time I
really don't know how long you're vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: but get them into their final pots top
them trellis them out flower them boom
[SPEAKER_00]: turn and burn there's no need to veg them
for extra time you're probably wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: time anyway if they're that tall or learn
to spread them out more vertically the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue lights would help you out but it's
not going to keep them that short and
[SPEAKER_00]: compact and now here's where the breeder
part comes in are you growing the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics maybe you need different genes in
that room if you got you're not running a
[SPEAKER_00]: basketball team you're running a different
team who's short maybe a soccer team I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what sport would benefit from
people being shorter but on the basketball
[SPEAKER_00]: team you want the seven foot ten guys on
the soccer team maybe you got the five
[SPEAKER_00]: foot nine guys maybe you don't have room
for the basketball team in your grow maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to find some more soccer team
mates in that grow maybe what I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to say some shorter squatty or stuff that
will grow better for you maybe you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want those eleven weeks sativas in that
room anyway shorter flowering stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: stays shorter probably would work better
in that room so one thing I would say is
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics understand your genetics do you
have the appropriate genetics in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: do you know those genetics have you grown
them enough times to understand what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: them stretch how long do they stretch how
long do they flower know your genetics how
[SPEAKER_00]: long have you been running this stuff
understand the stretch for each plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: then adjust your veg phase I keep saying
it we can't change the flowering time
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust your veg phase to work more for
these plants if you're running out of
[SPEAKER_00]: space two weeks and before you're done cut
off two weeks if you're running out of
[SPEAKER_00]: space three weeks cut off three weeks you
can only do it at the veg end so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to figure out your timing there
don't grow them so big maybe top them make
[SPEAKER_00]: them shorter before you go into flower but
this is something that has to be done in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg I do have some more notes here one of
my notes is you're not supposed to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: them until after you sell them so if
they're growing into the lights just make
[SPEAKER_00]: them shorter we know that we can't raise
the lights we already know that we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: to have at least depending on your lights
if you've got gavitas you need like two
[SPEAKER_00]: feet between the light and the canopy so
prepare for that are you growing on tables
[SPEAKER_00]: are you growing on the floor are you
growing on pots is there anything we can
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust in that range I really think it's a
timing issue though just start flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner so subtract some weeks of course
you are I understand that you are a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tech or something similar in that
environment there's probably a lead grower
[SPEAKER_00]: then there is probably a like a manager of
the facility or something and then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably an owner they probably have
investors probably a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_00]: arguing over what to do but it sounds like
you've identified the problem the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing into the lights and into the
fans which is basically a scheduling issue
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they're going to keep growing you
know you know they're gonna get bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not gonna stop doing it so I think
the solution is to flower earlier maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: send me some pictures send me some videos
let me know what's going on maybe I can
[SPEAKER_00]: send you an update but the solution is
flower sooner maybe more smaller plants
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of growing a bunch of really tall
plants grow a whole bunch of really small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that may be the way to do it for
you got less veg time just put more plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and that way they don't have to
get as tall you just fill the space more
[SPEAKER_00]: is your canopy full that's one of the most
important things to think about is the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy full if you got super tall stretchy
plants and the canopy is not full you're
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting a lot of space also you got
thousand watt lights in there do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough lights because if you have enough
they won't be so stretchy so think about
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics think about the kind of light
think about do you have enough light think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the spectrum then properly pop and
twist honestly though this is a timing
[SPEAKER_00]: issue maybe run a bunch of smaller plants
all right hey bro thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: message I did not say your name just
because I don't want to get you in any
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble if the work hears this and you're
not prepared to talk to them or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: but bro thank you for the great message
all right I'm going to move on to another
[SPEAKER_00]: message this one comes from oh this is
from our buddy slightly stoned stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up buddy I'm slightly stoned stupid
as well it's been a great day and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: these bright ass lights in my face so when
you take some fat dad to get these bright
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in your face it's like you're extra
blazed which is really great shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy slightly stoned stupid they sent
a question that said maybe you could talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about co2 levels and what they should be
as pre-harvest in a co2 enriched grow I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: asking because I have a perpetual harvest
going in one big flower room so a few
[SPEAKER_00]: plants come down every week but is it bad
to have co2 levels around 12 to 1500 all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so I do understand the question most
of the time we would crank up the co2 to
[SPEAKER_00]: certain levels depending on the stage of
veg or flower in which we are in but our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend slightly stoned stupid here is
running a perpetual space so sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: they may have plants at week 9 possibly
week 7 possibly week 6 possibly 4 2 I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know the rotation and the scheduling
but I know they're in different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes a lot of sense and is a very
good idea that way you've got a constant
[SPEAKER_00]: supply of medicine and you don't always
have to trim a whole bunch of herb I like
[SPEAKER_00]: this their main concern is is the high co2
level going to have a problem with plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are further into flower plants that
are not as far into flower are all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants going to be happy with the
augmented co2 my answer is you're 12 to 15
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred particles per million of co2 is
fucking perfect bro that's ideal that's
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful you're hitting right in the
sweet spot if you have enough light they
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to love that if you don't have
enough light that may be overdoing it it
[SPEAKER_00]: may be honestly just a waste if they don't
have enough light going on with that co2
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't use the co2 I will be away they
won't be able to photosynthesize anyway so
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be taking in the extra co2 and
they'll be like if we just had some light
[SPEAKER_00]: we could go fast so as long as you got
enough light in there to go with that co2
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to love that so let's talk a
little bit more about co2 since we're on
[SPEAKER_00]: this topic here 1200 to 2000 particles per
million is ideal depending on the stage
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in and most commercial environments
I try to hit about 1400 PPMs in flower the
[SPEAKER_00]: owners say stay at a thousand because the
shit's expensive the consultants say hit
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 1250 to 1400 is ideal where you want to
go for in there in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment co2 can get expensive over
2000 particles per million is excessive I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think the plants can even take over
18 definitely not over 2000 maybe they can
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think it's going to be
cost-effective I think you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: weird stuff happening after that 3000
particles per million is dangerous for
[SPEAKER_00]: humans so once you get that 3000 particles
per million of co2 in the air for a human
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets dangerous it'll start making you
feel dizzy lightheaded it'll fuck you up
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll definitely start causing problems
for the plants 5000 PPMs is fatal we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all gonna die so try not to get above that
2k I think you're doing great with your 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to 15 but if you've got the the ability to
crank it up don't go much higher than 18
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2000 it's gonna be fine I try to hover
honestly in a commercial environment we
[SPEAKER_00]: hover around a thousand to 1200 PPMs I try
for that 1400 but the doors are open the
[SPEAKER_00]: fans are running the exhaust fans happen
the co2 gets just shot right out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling sometimes in the room so we hover
and most of the facilities where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working we hover around a thousand to 1200
PPMs is what we stay around again 1400
[SPEAKER_00]: would be ideal but doors open fucking
cracks in the walls all that shit this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit gets away ambient so I'm talking
about augmented co2 these are places where
[SPEAKER_00]: we are getting a we in the commercial
grows we do it kind of fancy we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: truck that shows up and loads up a bunch
of tanks with co2 and we've got machines
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the rooms that just disperse co2
based on a monitor but that's augmented
[SPEAKER_00]: co2 and most environments like in this
room right now I don't have any co2
[SPEAKER_00]: augmentation or outside or whatever it's
probably around 400 to 450 particles per
[SPEAKER_00]: million of co2 just naturally in the
environment so when we crank it up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand or 1200 we are tripling the
natural co2 which really gives the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: some turbo it's like nitrous for the
plants basically it's co2 but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically nitrous for the plants you put
them on turbo mode so it is ideal to
[SPEAKER_00]: gradually increase co2 levels but it's not
required you can like if you just got the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment you just got the funding to do
it you can go in there just blast those
[SPEAKER_00]: bitches up go from your ambient 400 go
right up to 2000 if that's what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do they'll make it it'll happen they'll
survive they'll thrive with that but it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be more cost-effective and it
wouldn't be a problem to just slowly ramp
[SPEAKER_00]: it up start off just augmenting a little
bit more and more every day have a co2
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor in there if you're gonna use co2
have a monitor make sure it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: too high I mentioned before it can get
dangerously high that'll take a lot of co2
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that but have a monitor there are a
lot of different ways to augment co2 in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space I usually do the canisters with
the regulator and the monitor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor sees how much co2 is in the room
when it gets below a threshold it knows to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn on the thing it opens a solenoid the
co2 blasts into the room you run it
[SPEAKER_00]: through lines put the lines above the
plants because the co2 is heavier than
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen so it's going to fall down onto
your plants maybe put a fan down low
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing back up to push it back up and
just cycle that air also here's a random
[SPEAKER_00]: tip a fan a fan down low pointing up will
help disrupt insects insects are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: land on your leaves and hang out and make
a little space there if you got a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing up those bugs don't want to land
there they're going what the fuck why is
[SPEAKER_00]: the wind going up the wind doesn't ever go
up so they get confused they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out there so I like to do the
canisters and a regulator and a monitor is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to do it in my opinion there
are several other ways you can put a
[SPEAKER_00]: burner in your grow space the co2 burner
is very efficient it does burn natural gas
[SPEAKER_00]: it's always turned on you got a little
flame going get your co2 going there that
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to increase your heat in some
places that's cool in some places that
[SPEAKER_00]: will not work for you at all a lot of
people do a little mushroom kit bags and
[SPEAKER_00]: just co2 bags and things depending on your
space I don't see the cost-effectiveness
[SPEAKER_00]: of those unless you have a tiny tiny space
and if your space is that tiny you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really focused on co2 augmentation anyway
but that will work for you if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something tiny so there's a burner there's
a canister set up and then there are all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of little mushroom bags that they
sell and then some people will brew some
[SPEAKER_00]: wine or brew some beer and use that co2 to
augment the grow space as well double up
[SPEAKER_00]: double your pleasure double your fun don't
overdo it the plants can become immune to
[SPEAKER_00]: too much co2 that's right if you it's just
like giving them too much drugs bros just
[SPEAKER_00]: like they'll start building a tolerance
and then they won't they won't perform if
[SPEAKER_00]: you start overdoing it so if you introduce
it too soon this is why I said it may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea to slowly introduce them if you
go too hard too soon they're like oh 1800
[SPEAKER_00]: ppms of co2 sweet thank you and they're
gonna start performing real hard going
[SPEAKER_00]: real crazy but six or eight weeks later
they're gonna go oh 1800 ppms of co2 cool
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow kind of fast they're not gonna
be as excited about it so maybe introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: it slowly build your way up and then they
will not get their immunity so to speak to
[SPEAKER_00]: the co2 it will work better for them one
thing I will suggest because it is my
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility is if you are going to
augment co2 in your environment if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use a burner if you're going to
use a canister do have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor in there do have some sort of way
to let yourself know that co2 is too high
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be fatal if we get it in super high
concentrations so please don't die growing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed we don't need that shit that will not
look good for the community for the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement for anything and we love you we
need you here so don't die growing weed
[SPEAKER_00]: all right my buddy slightly stoned a
stupid I want to thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon message if you've got any more
questions you know I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: back from you ladies and gentlemen boys
girls pimps hoes friends foes smokers
[SPEAKER_00]: growers clone cutters pollen chukers all
of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out
[SPEAKER_00]: there I think this was a short episode but
I'm going to wrap it up I think it is all
[SPEAKER_00]: about quality over quantity I think this
was a good show I could ramble on and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it longer if you want but what would be
the point you know I'll be back in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of days with fresh new content
thank you again for listening if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: any questions corrections comments or
concerns you know I would love the
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback the email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com don't forget
[SPEAKER_00]: about the patreon at patreon.com and of
course please join us on discord somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: right now on discord someone's hanging out
having a conversation about some iri
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic strains talking about growing weed
in the mountains or smoking dabs at the
[SPEAKER_00]: mermaid you never know what could be
happening on the iri genetics discord join
[SPEAKER_00]: us we look forward to seeing you there
also now is a good time to like and
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribe if you're watching this video
and you enjoyed it please do click like on
[SPEAKER_00]: the video of course subscribe to the

[SPEAKER_00]: notification bell click on that
notification bell every time I put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: new episode you will get notified you'll
never miss any content we do put out the
[SPEAKER_00]: shows at a Sunday night into Monday
morning that is midnight it's 12 o'clock
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday morning does that make sense and
then also we put out the episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday into Thursday at midnight so
that's 12 o'clock Thursday morning is
[SPEAKER_00]: technically what that is join us we do the
premieres live the premieres pop out on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube at midnight most of the time I
hang out in the live chat hang out with
[SPEAKER_00]: the crew I'm smoking dabs I'm usually in
the discord video chat and watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: video at the same time watching the chat
so I'm trying to be as interactive with
[SPEAKER_00]: the community as I can of course that does
happen at midnight sometimes I fall asleep
[SPEAKER_00]: and miss it but join us on the premiere we
look forward to seeing you there please do
[SPEAKER_00]: like and subscribe I got rambly there at
the end of the show thank you guys for
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out you know I'll be back in a few
days with fresh new content let's give a
