[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, this is Doug Benson and
you're listening to the grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast hosted by my buddy Rasta
Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back podcast world,
I'm your host Rasta Jeff, this is episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 802 of the grow from your heart podcast
I've got a great show planned for us in
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give away free seeds That's
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've teamed up with our friends at seeds
here now calm to give away free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about the free seeds later
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you that team I read
genetics will be at the dude grows cup in
[SPEAKER_00]: La Port Colorado on June 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out DGC cup calm for
all the info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab those tickets because the event is
almost sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you check out the fresh
drop and restock it I read direct calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Gazm is back in stock at irie
direct calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go grab some orange Gazm get some lemon
Jeffrey get some golden goats some bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: goat, there should be some chemical
cocktail available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, every order does come with
free seeds at irie direct calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see what's in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab those beans before they do sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I think that is all of the
business we need to cover here at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a bunch of great messages here
right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into our favorite portion of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the question and answer
portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first question did come from the grow
help tab on the irie genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, irie genetics.com
on the top, there's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them does say grow help or grow
questions, click on that tab, we'll ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you a couple of questions, you'll get the
opportunity to type in your grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if I read your question on
the podcast, you do win a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first message came from our friend
who wants to be known as Rio tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, Rio tan, you have won a
free pack of irie genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me a follow up email with your
real name and your shipping address and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be more than happy to get a pack of
seeds in the mail to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message does go a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hello, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my friend, Rio tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Are there environmental
conditions that can induce a female
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant to produce pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work from your friend
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've been saying that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rowy tan ROI tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for pronouncing that
incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I was doing the I first it
is rowy tan, I think is how I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there conditions, environmental
conditions and or factors that will induce
[SPEAKER_00]: a female cannabis plant to produce pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a great question, but it puts
a lot of thoughts in my mind and sends me
[SPEAKER_00]: down a lot of different avenues of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the female cannabis plant is putting
off pollen, it is probably got some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of intersex trait or it has gone way too
long in the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this a lot of times, not everybody
listens to every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is main goal, the cannabis plants
number one goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's to get us high, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a side effect of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is number one goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its whole goal in life for that plant is
to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female plants want to receive pollen
so that they can make seeds so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue their generation next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like you, the male plants whole
goal in life is to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male plant wants to get nice and
tall, drop pollen onto some ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the lady will receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll drop the seeds into the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male and female plant will die at the
end of the season, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year they get to continue their
genetics through the seeds that they made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those plants get to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: His main goal is to reproduce and survive
for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in our grow rooms, we are preventing
the seeds from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our main goals is to stop the seed
production from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that by eliminating the male plants
and not having any pollen in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's another thing I'm sure I've
said on this podcast before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Jurassic park theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature always finds a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we do remove those male plants
from that grow room, remove that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: from the room, given the right conditions,
given enough time, that female plant may
[SPEAKER_00]: produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not sure that that plant is going
to produce pollen specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If pollen is coming from that female
plant, that means we've got a male flower
[SPEAKER_00]: on that female plant, which means that now
that plant is possibly labeled intersex,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how long we let it flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let almost any plant go for long
enough, not your hazes, those hazes,
[SPEAKER_00]: those long 16 week flowering plants,
take those out of this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a normal nine or 10 week,
eight or nine, 10 week flowering hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you let it go for 16 weeks,
that plant will start to show intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and it possibly will produce
pollen, if not just seed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some conditions that can
occur in our grow room or even outside
[SPEAKER_00]: that will encourage a female plant to try
to reproduce on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's if it does rhodolization,
which is by going too long in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase, eventually that plant
will just produce its own flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes going too long or messing up
certain environmental factors or feeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those things will encourage that
plant to show intersex traits and those
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex flowers, those male flowers can
pollinate that female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question was, are there
environmental conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the environmental
conditions that can cause, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to call this intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we want to lead up to
rhodolization.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options here,
but let's talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions that will cause,
I'm going to say seeds in your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because maybe not pollen, but these are
some things that will cause seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because pollen is more rare,
but seeds are not uncommon in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants could just be intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could just be the plant's genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a plant has male and female
chromosomes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will create seeds on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a factor, not environmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the environment will bring it
out, but sometimes it's just the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes light interruptions in the dark
period can cause intersex traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will lead to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plant was on 12-12 for a couple
of weeks and one day your timer failed and
[SPEAKER_00]: it stayed on for 24 hours, that's a good
possibility of getting seeds in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over and underfeeding our plants early in
the flowering phase can also lead to seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like overfeeding, underfeeding,
overwatering, underwatering, also high and
[SPEAKER_00]: low temperatures can definitely lead to
the intersex trait, which will lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too high and too low of humidity can lead
to intersex or seeds in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another method that I've talked about
earlier on this podcast is called
[SPEAKER_00]: rhodolization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is, like I said before,
if we take a nine or 10-week flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant and we stretch it out to 15
or 16 weeks, eventually that plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: produce its own seeds if we don't cut it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant wants to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its whole goal is to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That female plant's just going,
I got to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, nature does find a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many environmental things
that can cause this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are going to be swings,
inconsistencies in swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something happening
regularly and then something goes wildly
[SPEAKER_00]: out of control, that's most of the time
when we do see these problems in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're asking about pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is less common than seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get pollen, most of the time you've got
to do reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting pollen, you've probably
got an intersex plant and a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: late in flower, those male flowers that
pop up in a female plant, those are mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be more concerned about the
early intersex flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what are going to produce pollen
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a random rant attached to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to say,
if that plant produces pollen and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, those seeds will all be females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a plant in your grow room that
was a female plant, we thought it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: female and pollen came from that plant,
there's an issue with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever plant it's seeded, it's going to
produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are going to carry that
potential problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: However those seeds were formed,
however that pollen happened, that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue in my opinion because we should not
have pollen in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds possibly do contain that
problematic gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your grow room produced seeds and
you do not have any true males in that
[SPEAKER_00]: room or you did not reverse anything,
it is a very inaccurate assumption to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that all of those seeds will be
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason to believe that those
seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are possibly potentially problematic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came from a problematic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me go back and make sure I
answered this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we covered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there environmental conditions that
will induce a female to produce pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollen isn't going to be as common as
my final answer but seeds are definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex plants are very likely and once
again a lot of those things are caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: over and under feeding, out of control
temperature, drastic swings, and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: dark period interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I feel like I rambled on long
enough about this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Rowy Tan, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I do owe you a free pack of
seeds so please do send me a follow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: email with your shipping address and
please do include a real name because I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to hand deliver these boxes to the
post office and I don't like putting like
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Smokes Fat Blunts at hotmail.com as
your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give me a real name and a safe
address to send your seeds to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I've got another great question
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our buddy Grumpy Toad.
[SPEAKER_00]: No need to be so grumpy bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheer it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toad's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question says, I've heard you discuss
purple petioles a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to get your thoughts on how to
prevent them right from square one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In several episodes when I talk about
defoliation, I talk about pulling off any
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf which has got a purple petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the long stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got those big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are short leaves on your plant,
little leaves, and you got bigger leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: with the long stem coming out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That long stem is the petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it called the petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to say petiole because
that's just how I fucking say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always talk about pulling off any
leaves with purple petioles in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do heavy defoliation in a commercial
grow facility because in my experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, those big leaves are where
a lot of the problems begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where your powdery mildew happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the bugs like to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're removing those big leaves,
that's just less camping spots for powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew and for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also then we allow more airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We allow more light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just beneficial in many different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I say and train people to take
off those leaves with the purple petioles
[SPEAKER_00]: is because those are usually the older,
bigger leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real easy training technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I tell a bunch of guys or gals that are
going into the grow, take off all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple petiole leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really easy thing to identify and
they can take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to come keep asking me,
should I take this leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I take this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that petiole purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull that fucker off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a training technique and
kind of a training method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that works, like I said,
is because those are usually the bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be the leaves that are
blocking the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be the leaves that are
also going to attract and house those bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: and problems should they show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is mainly why I pull those big
leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always is there a problem with those
big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is asking, how do I prevent
that from square one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the podcast and the genetics as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace from Grumpy Toad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes those purple petioles are
unpreventable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that is just genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your plant is going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies and cookies crosses
oftentimes are going to make purple
[SPEAKER_00]: petioles if you grow them correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my Girl Scout cookies gets black
leaves and looks real dark and the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: petioles are real, almost burgundy and
maroon, that was when the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies flowers tasted the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH was low, the EC was low,
and those plants were just barely eating,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost starving, but they tasted so good
when you smoked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those always made purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of a desirable trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was sort of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of plants, the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phenotype of the machine that no
matter what you do, the petioles will be
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a pigment in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always going to be something
you can prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple petioles are not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, it's just a training
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something I was using to show the
crew how to defoliate quite quickly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, things you can do to monitor and
prevent these purple petioles is
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and nutrition are mainly the
causes of the purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it getting cold in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you feeding the plants enough
phosphorus and potassium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be the things that lead
to that purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, too much light can purple up these
petioles a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got too much light in the room,
that is one of the things that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your water cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your plants sitting in cold water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you watered earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that I water, I've got a
sometimes it's a three, sometimes it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say a three gallon pot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits in a saucer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to go out of town for the
weekend, I would water that three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot until it ran off and halfway filled my
saucer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would buy me an extra day or two of
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only do this to bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how I buy an extra day.
[SPEAKER_00]: or two to go enjoy my weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I overwater that saucer a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant is sitting on the floor and
that water gets real cold, that will make
[SPEAKER_00]: everything turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your leaves will get purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The petioles will get purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cold water is going to cause
purpleness and that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there is the water cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants sitting on the cold floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you feeding it cold water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they sitting in cold water?
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be something leading to your
purpling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I've said a couple of times,
purple is not always an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking off the purple leaves
because it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking them off because it's a simple
training technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to do semi heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude grumpy toad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't always remove those purple
petioles because they are a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I'm just removing those as
a preventative measure because I do like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do such heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend grumpy toad, I do owe you a free
pack of iri genetic seeds because I read
[SPEAKER_00]: your message here on the on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be sure to send me your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, do include a real name I
can't ship a package to grumpy toad that
[SPEAKER_00]: may get noticed and they're going to look
at me silly at the post office.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving because I've
got another great question here in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a general grow question and it
goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, what's up Lazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope all is well with you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out with you guys recording a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dogs are chilling passed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good in stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is finally cooling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super hot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too early to start bitching about the
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only gonna get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm currently growing lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm growing with Gaia green organic,
organic dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Gaia green organic dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the garden is currently in week
four a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use compost teas yesterday and I noticed
a couple of leaves are drying and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a picture here that would
have helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm not sure what causes this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the fan is drying it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, it's just a couple of leaves on
the side where the fan is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she is starting to smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all you do any and any
advice you can give, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common thing that I see
when people have grow questions or grow
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see something that you think is
probably causing the problem, follow your
[SPEAKER_00]: gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go with your intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust your instincts from the things that
you have said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably that fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said that in the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're you've got to trust yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got you're smart enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're confident enough and you know what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rely on your gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your gut was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good idea to send me a message
and double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this sounds like it is the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what happens when you put
too much wind on your ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the leaves start to get a papery
and dried up texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get kind of papery is the best way
I can put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be succulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have some juice to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, if the fans been hitting
them, they'll get this sound to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That they'll get that going on and they
shouldn't sound like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should sound like soft and supple and
moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're starting to get crispy
because the wind is blowing on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is definitely from the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're turning yellow in that spot,
curling up, starting to fall off,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is from the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this could be because it is too hot
or too dry in your grow room, which also
[SPEAKER_00]: could be from the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just drying up that area and the
plan is just going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trying to rescue the rest of the
plant and move the moisture around and
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrifice those couple of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also could be overfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bro, when you said right away it's the
fan, I'm just going to go with you and
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that it is the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lot of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I don't have any photos in here
and you said the fan right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to say it's the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your leaves start to get like a
leathery or papery texture, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: look juicy like they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you haven't overfed or done anything
strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a fan blowing right on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have a fan going in the grow
room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep the air moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bugs don't want to build homes where
there's a bunch of wind moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a fan coming around every
couple of seconds, spider mites are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go, bro, this sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go build somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've seen spider mites use the fan
to move from one plant to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've already got them,
you're just going to move around with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we really want the goal is to
have all of the leaves just rustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them waving around like the
wacky wild inflatable tube man in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: the car dealership.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just want them moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the leaves, every leaf should
just be moving around and rustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your fan oscillates, make sure that it
hits this part of the room and then comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back and hits that part and then hits that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more than one fan,
put more than one fan in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I want to talk about with
multiple fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend who would try to set up
multiple fans in the room to blow and
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillate exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a neat idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked super organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice for the OCD and the
ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that was most beneficial
for the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we were trying to do is mix the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All he was doing, what I think was
happening, I think if we would have blown
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke in the room, we would have just saw
smoke move around the room and a pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the air to mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to mix the air so that we don't
get micro climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just move the air around,
you're going to have pockets of hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets of cold just moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to mix that air together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just get your fans organized to
blow like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to create a wind tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a wind blender, not just a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my advice for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my dude, Lazy, it does sound like your
main issue is just that those fans are
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fan is blowing on those leaves and
drying them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine if you went and sat in front
of a high powered fan all day or just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long would it take for the side of
your face where the fan is just to start
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling kind of weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever go to a sporting event or go
fishing or just go to a concert,
[SPEAKER_00]: be outside all day facing one direction
and the sun is just hitting you from one
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan is hitting you from another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind is hitting you from that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, that whole side
just feels fucked up and wind burnt and
[SPEAKER_00]: sun burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're doing to the plants,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either rotate the plants a little bit
or turn down that fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you rotate the plants, do it every hour
or so, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not hitting the same exact spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my advice, my recommendation would be
either to pull the fan back or turn that
[SPEAKER_00]: bad bitch down or turn it off for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally just give those plants a
little bit of a rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, lazy, I do want to
