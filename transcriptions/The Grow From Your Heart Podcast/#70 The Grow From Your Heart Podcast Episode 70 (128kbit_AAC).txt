[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 70 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a big huge thank
you to all of you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Mystic Roots band for
letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Kat Kuh and the entire Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The song you're listening to right now is
called the Doggy Dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support my friends in the
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great show put together for
you, Kat, for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn that music down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really distracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut that right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a few things I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody that's helped me out this past
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was driving up to Colorado Springs to go
see our good friends Hunt and Damsel and
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, the Jordans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, John Randall's Jr. was
headed up there to spring was going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: pay them a visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fucking transmission went out on
my car about a mile from Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see the first exit in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see the dam circle drive,
Lake Avenue sign right in front of me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just couldn't get off the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: My car pretty much exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like I was doing a good 75 miles
an hour on the interstate in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like my car downshifted from 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately was going about 45 miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded like sort of like, and then it
was like, is what it felt like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like my engine was trying to jump
out of the car and into my lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course I hit the brakes,
signaled, got over as quickly as I could,
[SPEAKER_00]: got to the side of the road, turn on the
hazards, called AAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took AAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They quoted me 85 minutes to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got there in 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fucking 85 minute is a long,
85 minute wait is a long wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 minutes was less than what they
promised me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that that's a good job on AAA's
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made friends with the AAA tow truck
driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had your business card with me
right now in my pocket, but I have set it
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually in the car that's broken
down that is at the mechanic shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I get your card out of there,
I'll give you a shout out on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: because the truck driver was a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to tow me about 50 miles home,
get me back to the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a car for a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cost a little bit to get
that son of a bitch fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, trying to move on,
trying to have a good week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to talk about cannabis here,
but I want to talk a little bit first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that I hit my head at the
beginning of April, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is now, I'm recording this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The date is May 14th as we record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm getting it back together
so much, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for tolerating my
bullshit while I've had a head wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys that stuck with me,
you're my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being there while I was kind of
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about a product I ordered
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking something called
AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it at onit.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two N's in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's O-N-N-I-T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onit Labs makes a lot of great products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to reach for my bottle of
AlphaBrain right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the bottle in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: AlphaBrain is a complete earth grown
nootropic with Alpha GPC and AC11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like a bunch of
bullshit to you guys, but they say that
[SPEAKER_00]: lecturers, educators, speakers,
public speakers, radio personalities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and folks like that use AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that inspired me to use it is Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Joe Rogan does his podcast,
he takes a couple of AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he does the UFC events, he announces
the commentates on the UFCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does three AlphaBrain pills for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking two a day and I can feel
a sharpness in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vocabulary is stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a problem after I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to recall words and I'd say,
hey, can you hand me my... And I just
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't think of what basic words were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like screwdriver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or flashlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I would just forget words,
but the AlphaBrain is making that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making me a better speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making me remember and recall more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making me calmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've described it as... Maybe I've said
this on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm full of shit with my memory
thing, but I've described it as my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: has the main track that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like the, you got to wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to brush your teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get to work on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do your chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to call this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that track is playing in your
head, but there's always that side
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit that goes on in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just whispers at you occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I wonder what that girl's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I miss somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just bullshit that happens in your head
that you really don't need to be focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like weird things pop up into your
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the AlphaBrain has kind of quieted
that secondary track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where I'm able to focus on what I'm
supposed to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which gets me to my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcasts are getting much better,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make the podcast a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much, much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to AlphaBrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to On It Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take two a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely feel, I'm more talkative,
but it's because my thoughts are more
[SPEAKER_00]: clear and I can put together much better
sentences, much better podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, I got the phone on loud here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put that bitch on silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very unprofessional podcast
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the phone on silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to talk about another product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard us talk about Floria on a
previous podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floria is a medicated personal lubricant,
which means it is a, it's a sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: lubricant that contains cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody heard that I talked about it on
the show and they gave me a product called
[SPEAKER_00]: Evos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I can tell, Evos and Floria
are very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly similar was what I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are both coconut oil infused with
cannabis and they are meant to be applied
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, the instructions pretty much
say apply it to the female's parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be straight up about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some Evos and I sprayed it up on my
partner's goods and it made a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely, there was nothing to
complain about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was going just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we added that stuff, it made it a
little, it made my junk warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like it's already warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, but it felt a little warmer and
tingling or it made my stuff feel a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was definitely a heightened
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that it was definitely a
heightened experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just coconut oil and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had no worries about putting it on my
body or in her body or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It washed off really cleanly and really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One funny thing that I said when I was
done, and I'm sorry if I'm being too
[SPEAKER_00]: explicit you guys, but it's my podcast and
I'll talk about my dick if I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was done, I was, I felt,
I wasn't aroused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was all done and soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all floppy, but I felt like my dick
was fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've given somebody a massage with
apothecana lotion before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've explained my hands like feeling
like I was wearing Mickey mouse gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dick felt like it was fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to the touch, if I would touch it,
I felt like it was thicker than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a weird, okay, enough about my dong
on the show, but I tried the Evos and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for something to add to the
bedroom fun and you want to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and spend a few bucks,
there's nothing wrong with Evos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening, let's do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about Evos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change the tone a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that is not good that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to explain to a friend
something and I don't know the science
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it, but I know that this is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my dab rig gets dirty, my chunk of
globby resin in there, and this probably
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to the bong with bong resin if
you're just smoking flour, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed that when I'm hitting the dab rig,
once the rig gets dirty, I feel like that
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk of resin in there is actually
stealing part of my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when you've got a big floater,
if you look at my rig right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is like a quarter gram of hash just
floating in my rig water and it's not old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig water's only been in there for
three or four days at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just dab heavy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This e-nail never turns off, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the coffee pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns on at a certain time in the
morning and then it goes off right when I
[SPEAKER_00]: go to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm taking big fat globs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll clean the rig and take fat globs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fat globs, I get super baked just like I
should, but as the rig gets dirtier,
[SPEAKER_00]: I stop getting as high and stop choking
and stop enjoying my dab as much as it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets dirtier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that chunk of resin in there
collects the resin that's the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It collects all your cannabinoids and your
smoke and whatever you're trying to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sticks to that ball and it's ripping
you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point, clean your fucking rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get some rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really super sticky, get yourself
some kosher salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill the rig halfway up with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little bit of kosher salt in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The salt is working as an abrasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna scratch all that resin off of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover up both holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go somewhere where you got a carpeted
floor if you're a pothead and just shake
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit out of that rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we're going to the carpeted
floor is so that when you drop the rig,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a better chance of living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go shake the shit out of that rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I know it's disgusting,
but just pour all that fucking reclaim
[SPEAKER_00]: right down the drain and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people that use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna hate on you if you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use it, especially if you just
mix alcohol into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But flush that shit right down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then rinse the rig out a couple of
times with super hot water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it cool down to a normal temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it back up with water at the right
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A right amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, the right level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw your nail on there and get down on
some clean, tasty dabs and enjoy the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor of your dabs again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think a clean rig is more
important than people realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's enough of that PSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got more shit written down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was asking me, I got an email or
a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot recall where it came from right
now, but somebody was asking me about rig
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I choose a good rig?
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, if you're dabbing,
I prefer a small rig over a big piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we used to smoke pot out of a
giant bong is so that you can fill all
[SPEAKER_00]: that space with a big, thick, chunky hit
of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you pull that carb or you
pull the bowl out or you take your finger
[SPEAKER_00]: off, however you carb your bong,
if you're from the 70s, you just take your
[SPEAKER_00]: finger off that hole in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from the future, you got to pull
the stem out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you carb it, you're supposed to get
all that fucking smoke into your lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: right at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, you just got a big old bong hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you get baked from the
bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that piece, clear it, get all your
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're smoking dabs, your dab is just
burning up right when you put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: nail and you start smoking and you're
getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we need a big ass piece for
a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a little tiny rig to where when you
put it on there, you put the carb cap on
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you inhale, you get that smoke
right to your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to build a whole bunch of
smoke into one chamber and then clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want that dab to go through the
rig, through the water to cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then into your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main recommendation is something
kind of small.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite rig, and you're going to think
I'm crazy, but my favorite rig is my
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Sidecar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the right height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that's probably five inches
tall, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go up to the mouthpiece,
it's probably seven inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my Mad Rob rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucker is probably four inches tall
at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a lot of percolation on a
rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something that gets plenty
of bubbles, you don't need a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you want to do is cool your dab smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it coming off of that hot
nail directly into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put a little water through there,
just enough to cool it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like a lot of water on my rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I think over percolation on a
dab, like if you've got too many sections
[SPEAKER_00]: of water, you're kind of overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Toro cans that have the tree
perk, and then it's got the little shower
[SPEAKER_00]: head perk in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my favorite is the Hitman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do like the mothership rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things hit like a boss, but you're
looking at like 2,500 to 3,000 for a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're asking me for advice,
you don't need advice on a mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a nice Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid of, you don't have to buy
name brand glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind that if you're buying
Chinese made glass, there's probably some
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese little kid making it in unsafe
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have good eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably barefoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to, if you can buy some American
glass, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth the extra few bucks just to
know that you have ethically made glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's some karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, Hitman's a good company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't support the show or anything,
but they're always innovators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lead the glass game in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go expensive, get yourself
a coil or some beer glass or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coil is going to be ridiculous,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking about my favorite rigs
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm going to mention,
so get a small rig without a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: percolation, something that keeps the nail
a little bit away from your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're checking out these rigs at the
store, try to put the nail that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to buy right on that rig and then
see how far away that nail is from your
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't really like the nail
higher than the mouthpiece or real right
[SPEAKER_00]: in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed a couple inches away from my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nose so that I can see where I'm
putting the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go cross-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important part, the most important
part when you're buying a rig is the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're heating up to a couple
hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're putting your extract
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be heated and cooled and
heated and cooled all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm burping here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink right quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a good quality titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only brand I will recommend for
titanium is Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a nail for your rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you're trying to do,
Highly Educated has got the perfect nail
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need guidance on the nail,
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a picture of your rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what kind of nail to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do really like the quartz nails if you
get a good quality quartz nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend the Halen Honey Hole if you do
big fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into smoking solventless and
BHO, definitely get the Honey Hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds a lot of heat for when you smoke
solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of room to get a big
solventless dab in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like the Quave Banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Quave Banger is going to be a little
bit pricey, but they are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste super clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who just made the trough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that Joel Halen that just made the
trough?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not had a chance to try the trough
yet, but they look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's made out of good quality quartz,
I bet it's going to be a good quartz
[SPEAKER_00]: banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a company that is selling,
they call them quartz bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the nail that it's quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a faucet spout with a little
bucket at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your dab in the bucket part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, there's a company that's selling
those that's claiming they're quartz and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to buy glass and reheat it
and let it cool and reheat it and let it
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a good quartz piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quartz can handle the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we go back to that stuff talking
about what's made in America, what's made
[SPEAKER_00]: in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to do that with your quartz products
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a Halen Honey Hole, get a real Quave
Banger, or get yourself a real,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly educated titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the only nails I will support on
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, guys, send me some nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all the nails I can use right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good nail is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, recently I discovered something that
the people in Colorado may be excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, Kind Love in Denver has
occasionally been putting out clones of my
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually bought seeds from me at an
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought several packages of seeds and
they ran the Lemon Jeffrey and they found
[SPEAKER_00]: their phenotypes that are killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've tested from the 24 to 26s and they
actually said that they could have grown
[SPEAKER_00]: the herb better, but there was an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that next time you're going to
see 28 to 29% on the Lemon Jeffrey from
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, you can pick up Lemon
Jeffrey clones at Kind Love and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big, fat, healthy, luscious
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call before you drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not reserve a clone for you,
so you have to call.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to say, do they have this clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they say yes, then you got to get
in the car and haul ass over there because
[SPEAKER_00]: they will not reserve a clone for you,
but they might have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I'm talking a
million miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause, take a dab,
and then we're going to get into some
[SPEAKER_00]: news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Task
and Lioness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me use the music on the
show, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about some news,
like I said, but to lead into the news,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about a comedy
show that I went to recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint and I were bragging that we got to
go see the taping of Doug Loves Movies,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Benson is a weed comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a show called Doug Loves Movies
where they play games.
[SPEAKER_00]: He usually brings three comedians or some
level of superstars to the show with him
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are his contestants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play for the audience and the
audience will win the prizes based on who
[SPEAKER_00]: wins in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug Loves Movies came to ComedyWorks in
downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know how much I love ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the entire crew there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for that giant cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt that coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint drove me up there because,
like I said, my transmission is fucked,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Clint drove us up there and got us to
the Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always feed us well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got us to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about Doug's last show not being
up to standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, we laughed our asses off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He completely, completely made up for the
lack of funny in the last show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm catching my breath after that
cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took some pretty gnarly dabs while we
were off the air there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys were listening to that
commercial about the worm company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am going to read this article
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to catch my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do it, you guys, Doug Benson,
he pulled off a great show, a great
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to the exact episode if you
go to iTunes search for Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episode actually is titled something
about I'm going to look at my phone right
[SPEAKER_00]: here just so that I can tell you
accurately what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got this iPhone takes a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of episodes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's titled Jeff Tate, Julian McCullough
and Ricardo Baca guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was put up on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out if you want to,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe somebody an apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got to fix that sound equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this shit spiked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe somebody an apology at ComedyWorks,
a patron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gifted the luxury of kind of a
lifetime VIP pass for ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I call ahead and let my friend
know that I'm coming, I can get a VIP seat
[SPEAKER_00]: in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know how many of us there will be
and they'll put me in the front row as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as I've got tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made arrangements to have my front row
privileges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to the club and when it was time to
seat us, the seating people kind of looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at each other with some concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one guy said, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go tell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one seating person, I don't know
what he's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call him an usher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one usher dude had to go tell two
people that they had to move because the
[SPEAKER_00]: seats that they were sitting in up front
had been reserved for Doug's VIP special
[SPEAKER_00]: guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt bad for that because those people
probably waited in line for a good hour
[SPEAKER_00]: while I was at the Mellow Mushroom eating
pizza or in the car taking fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Claude the Candy Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a sweet stone candy, a Claudey Bear
before I went into the show, about two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by show time, woohoo, I was sweet
stoned for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to go and move these two
people because I've got this VIP pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sit, Clint and I, in the most
prime fucking seats in the club right up
[SPEAKER_00]: front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel hatred.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were staring at us like we were
huge dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually the guy sitting next
to us got tired of the tension and he just
[SPEAKER_00]: said, so who the fuck are you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Clint said, nobody, I'm with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, we're just friends of
Doug's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, yeah, they moved our
friends because you guys are Doug's
[SPEAKER_00]: special guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt kind of like a shithead for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a great ass time up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good ass show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go and read this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking for a long time about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just got an article written.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was excited because what Doug does,
dude, excuse all the coughing and throat
[SPEAKER_00]: clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took some gnarly dabs of some
Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that was the last one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the dabbed throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was excited because when he announced
his guests, he said Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew who that was right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of our news on this show is
written by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this came out May 11th and it
was in The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, talk about nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As 420 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver time approached on May 10th,
aka Mother's Day, I was sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks green room with some insanely
talented standup comics getting ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: take the stage for a taping of my single
favorite podcast in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comic Doug Benson, also a legit weed hero,
had generously asked me to be a guest on
[SPEAKER_00]: his movie podcast, Doug Loves Movies,
after seeing the marijuana journalism
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary Rolling Papers at the South by
Southwest Film Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna jump in right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Rolling Papers, a movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: A camera crew followed, what's his name,
Ricardo Baca around for a year and
[SPEAKER_00]: followed members of his staff and part of
the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They followed him for an entire year and
recorded and made a documentary about the
[SPEAKER_00]: journalism, marijuana journalism that is
developed in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've dubbed the movie Rolling
Papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was purchased after its first showing
at the South by Southwest Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's coming out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep you guys updated when that comes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse all the coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weed show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're coughing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the article goes on to say,
and then the nerves came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people listen to this,
I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after meeting my fellow guests,
Wipsmart comedians, Jeff Tate and Julian
[SPEAKER_00]: McCullough, and seeing Benson again,
I knew we were in for a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast taping was a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sold out crowd at ComedyWorks was
super rad and Benson's team took less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours to launch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he means the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everyone can listen via the
embedded Doug Loves Movies site or iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you go to douglovesmovies.com
or go to iTunes, you can listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great, great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricardo Baca did quite damn well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on stage with three witty top level
comedians and he held his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not try to step up and be a
comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He remained Ricardo Baca and I respected
him for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He let the comedians comedy and he did his
job and was the person that they invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my throat is tickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna press pause for a second and
I'll be right back with another news
[SPEAKER_00]: article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, you guys wouldn't believe what
I just spit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have took a picture of that for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I should have recorded the sound of
that hitting wherever it landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a side note on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain of the day is golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often credit me for making the
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not invent the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply put it into feminized seed for
the world to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat was created by Mr. Dank in
Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Mr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm catching my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can hear that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are gonna read another news
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna fix some recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blowing some shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the air conditioner next to me
and I don't think you guys can hear it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the recording equipment is struggling
to keep me and this fucking air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner separate in the recording
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty neat watching the lights light
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this one hits close to home
because I do live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually the grower at a very popular
dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo West is like a sub development just
outside of the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 10 minutes to the west,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know that it's exactly
completely a little nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's newer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have old town problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the old rickety parts of
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks a lot nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a part that we call the
county, which if you drive outside of city
[SPEAKER_00]: limits, there are a lot of stores and
shopping areas in the county and the
[SPEAKER_00]: county and Pueblo West are allowed to have
dispensaries, but the city of Pueblo has
[SPEAKER_00]: not been allowed dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read an article that came out
May 12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I really do apologize for this
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took some gnarly dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit taking so many dabs on the show
so that you guys can hear me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also come be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk while I'm clearing my throat and you
guys can give me a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article says, Pueblo pot shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Voters will decide whether to allow retail
sales in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only by the APs who gets credit for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo lawmakers are letting the voters
decide whether to allow recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana shops in their city.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pueblo chieftain reports concerned
residents filled the city council chambers
[SPEAKER_00]: Monday night, many wearing yellow shirts
that said voice your choice and urging
[SPEAKER_00]: their elected officials to put the issue
to voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilman Bob Schilling was the only vote
in favor of licensing retail pot shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but said that he hasn't opposed a vote in
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of the six council members who
voted against adopting the ordinance had
[SPEAKER_00]: been in favor before the public hearing,
including president Steve Narake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said there isn't the issue isn't worth
dividing the public over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did vote and they did decide to push
back the vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no recreational or medical
marijuana shops in the city of Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: until they vote again, which will be in
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you live in Pueblo,
you have to drive 15 minutes to the county
[SPEAKER_00]: or to Pueblo West to go purchase your
cannabis and then drive back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the city that you live in isn't
getting your tax money for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're able to purchase because of
these stupid fucking regulations that
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo has been juggling with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the legal medical marijuana
industry in this city since we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: first shop, I think that was nine years
ago when we had Medamar downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that is closed, there has not
been another medical shop or a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational shop in the city that was
legally licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been places that popped up
randomly and were closed, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of retarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't use the word retarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mean to the retarded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's ridiculous and stupid that we
are not allowed to have a recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis shop within city limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need the tax money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This town is broke and hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of weed money would really help
this city.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another news article that I found
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Castle Rock Man pleads guilty to
mailing Colorado pot across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is written by Anthony Cotton of
the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was published May 12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's, you're going to, you're going
to catch on right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point when I start reading this,
it says, a Castle Rock Man pleaded guilty
[SPEAKER_00]: on charges that included sending more than
a hundred packages that included marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: to locations across the country and
receiving several hundred thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: through the mail and return.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the, according to the United
States district attorney's office,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Daniel Evans, age 42, began mailing
pot packages in April of 2014 and
[SPEAKER_00]: continued through that fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evans pleaded guilty this April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officials said Evans first came under
suspicion on April 2nd, 2014, when a US
[SPEAKER_00]: postal inspector came across a suspicious
mailing that may have contained narcotics
[SPEAKER_00]: or narcotic proceeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first package in question came from
Missouri and it contained cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That package was sent to a commercial mail
receiving agency mailbox and was addressed
[SPEAKER_00]: to an individual in Loan Tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ongoing investigation traced a car
under surveillance to Evans who was also
[SPEAKER_00]: seen mailing parcels from post offices in
the metro area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officials said inspectors also conducted
search, a search of Elvin's apartment that
[SPEAKER_00]: that search recovered 580 grams of bagged
marijuana, 800 grams of marijuana extract
[SPEAKER_00]: or hash oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a lot of hash oil,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's close to two pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,480 grams of marijuana edibles for a
total weight of 6,860 grams of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys heard that stupid shit in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,480 grams of marijuana edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking weighing the brownies and
charging him with the weight of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking brownies for the grams of pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking whack, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like weighing the baggie too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you can't do that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a shitty drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole article is fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy should not have done that,
but that part right there is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna continue the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: A search of his vehicle found an
additional 78 grams of liquid marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably had some tincture,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had previously mailed two additional
packages that were seized by law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those packages contained 3,650 grams or 54
grams of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: In total, inspectors learned that Elvin
sent 11,026 grams of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Law enforcement also had seized during the
investigation more than $53,000 in cash,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was the proceeds from his illegal
narcotics transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That money was forfeited to the government
as part of Elvin's plea agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elvin's pled guilty to three counts of
possession of a controlled substance with
[SPEAKER_00]: the intent to distribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: He now faces more than 20 years in federal
prison and up to a $1 million fine per
[SPEAKER_00]: count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point here, people, is quit mailing
weed out of Colorado unless you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: end up in federal prison doing 20 years
and facing up to $1 million in fines per
[SPEAKER_00]: count.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several reasons we shouldn't be
mailing cannabis out of the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, it's illegal and you're gonna
go to prison and you're gonna get butt
[SPEAKER_00]: raped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't sound like fun to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't sound like the fucking profit I'm
making from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, in Colorado, the people
that have fought hard to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, medically and recreationally,
we did it for here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're fucking it up by mailing it
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you're sending it, they're
responsible for legalizing cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: their area, not us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by sending it out, you're fucking up
what we worked hard for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making something shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a system that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've created laws and we're playing by
the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're gonna be a fucking
shithead and take the rules that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: made and you can grow and smoke all the
weed you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hustle weed in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit sending it out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking it up, making everybody
look bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're gonna get caught and get butt
raped and go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read about you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep sending that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will proudly read your name and laugh at
you on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send cannabis out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalize cannabis everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact your local Congress people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that shit where you are and get it
legalized in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough herb here.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are hurting for herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are patients that want cannabis that
don't have any medicine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're sending that shit to other
states to make a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the money out of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put more compassion into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just chat for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have promised you a scheduling episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I was gonna do an episode about
scheduling your grow for a perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am writing it, but I had an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a stumbling block.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many lights you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how to write a perpetual
cycle for your room, but I have found a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm writing it based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll probably be one or two episodes
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other episode I have been teasing
about is improving your gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say top 10 ways to improve
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about 30 ways written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a long episode that is
definitely coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk too much about any of
that stuff because we'll just save it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out again to
Clint and Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who has helped
me deal with not having a car this week or
[SPEAKER_00]: this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a real pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if we had some plans that I had
to cancel or rearrange, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a blown transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Chevrolet legs will get me so far,
but the weather has been shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take some dads or if you
want to be on the podcast, you got to come
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna wrap up the show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay a lot more attention to a 35,
40 minute episode than you do those hour
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Stitcher or iTunes or Twitter or
Facebook or email me and tell me if you
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer the 30 minute episodes over the
hour long episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's better when I do two 30
minute episodes instead of the long hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys really listen more.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat doesn't fuck up as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a guest, we'll go an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's just me, I'm gonna try to go
about 30 and try to do two episodes a
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, in my opinion, let me know what
you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show isn't just for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is a lot for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for listening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a few days with another
episode, probably about ways to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.

[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, my transmission blew the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to tell you the truth, as of what
episode is this, this is number 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: That adventure that we were talking about
for my daughter, the deadline for that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the first.

transmission from here on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up honest about that bullshit.

throw in $5, throw in $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transmission is $2,600.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working our way toward that.

[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you, Sloppy.
