[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode I tried to record,
I did not sound very professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not sound very healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for all of the
well wishes, all of the kind words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody said, Hey bro, I hope you feel
better soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel sick at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt great, but my throat just didn't
sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all of the kind words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support and thank
you for watching the short episode that I
[SPEAKER_00]: put out for Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do kind of apologize for putting out a
short shitty episode, but sometimes that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how life is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not miss a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the kind words and
all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, thanks to everybody who sent,
uh, ideas and tips and tricks and recipes
[SPEAKER_00]: and what are they called remedies?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word I'm searching in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all of the home remedies to get
my throat back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently one of them or a combination of
them did the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to be back here on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm chattery ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I did smoke some arise rosin today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to a local grower who would
rather remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want people to know what he's
doing around here, which is kind of smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but my friend made, he grew,
he got some seeds of arise from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He selected a phenotype that he thought
would press well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He squished.
[SPEAKER_00]: It into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually not a big fan of the rosin,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are getting better at making the
rosin and this shit was hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He watched my face really carefully as I
took the dab because my face gives me
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll try to say, yeah,
that dab was tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dab was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then my cheeks and my eyes and my lips
will say, man, this dab tastes like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to throw up from hitting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my buddy was watching me the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, bro, you, you seem to like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, this dab tastes so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not taste what arise was for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't taste what I'm familiar with
arise tasting like that concentrate made
[SPEAKER_00]: it taste a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high was completely different than
what I'm used to from any phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever smoked arise of arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going fast and I'm excited,
but I've never gotten that buzz from
[SPEAKER_00]: arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked a lot of arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked several phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked it in concentrate form,
flower form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, now I've smoked it in rosin and
solventless concentrate form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it gets my head moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me kind of thinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to like talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to get on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I exhaled that dab, I wanted to like
sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, Oh, and I just kept,
I said I was melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, bro, I'm melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking becoming part of this chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that commercial back in the day
when the girl did drugs and she became the
[SPEAKER_00]: chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got that weed that makes you
become the chair, I'll take a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a, I'll take an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a joke, YouTube, don't get at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but where was I that, that concentrate
made me melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious, but it was, it caught me
off guard because it was a completely,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing I noticed was,
Oh, that's a totally different flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, usually the arise has a cushiness with
a sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one had, uh, almost a tropical
spiciness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say mango habanero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the closest thing I can get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had mango habanero salsa,
and it reminded me of that in a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a spicy thing, but it had that
sweet mango to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I blew it out, my arm hair moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you, I know that when I exhale a
dab, if my arm hair moves, that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous freaking dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my arm hair went wobble, wobble,
wobble when I blew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got like super sat down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to like chill out and melt into
the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually the arise makes me move,
makes me go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy for the arise
Roz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently, uh, being on the mic and
smoking a rise got me fucking super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me high as shit is a note that I
wrote high as fuck is what I wrote down.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big thank you and a big
shout out to everybody who supports the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently surpassed the 7,000 subscriber
mark on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 7,000 YouTube subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think putting out the episodes about
topping and cloning really helped out with
[SPEAKER_00]: subscriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a lot of followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those episodes got a lot of views.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two of my most viewed episodes
and they're brand new in the feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means they're only going to become
even more watched.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to stay on YouTube forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people keep watching, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have watched those
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got us to 7,000 YouTube subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to look like an ass and say,
that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just because I want more for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just because I want more people
watching because I want people growing
[SPEAKER_00]: better herb out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I teach you how to grow a
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pitch you too many products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only products I pitch you are products
that actually use.
[SPEAKER_00]: No company says, Hey, we'll give you
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you advertise this, that's not the way
it works with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, buy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't get paid for advertising,
but I don't come on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't shove a bunch of products down
your throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't beg you for a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so let's get more people watching the
show is my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way more people can grow better
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all of the growers are watching,
they're all learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to step up our game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means every time you go somewhere to
smoke, there will be better herb there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're all growing better herb also will
all help to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll all get in the same mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to legalize this plant
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a big unification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the healing herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the healing of the nation,
the great uniter, the unifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get everybody on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, tell some friends, invite some friends
to subscribe to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, one more big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally surpassed and have steadily
held at over 200 patrons on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every month, 200 people choose to support
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a new Patreon supporter,
if you're old school from back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: sincerely, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, we've gone through a very hard
time, uh, in the economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have been really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have chosen to throw money,
my direction, that does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are 200 of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to send messages on Patreon and say,
thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to interact with Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, there's just one of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about it a lot, but I'm
really proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter just graduated high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just turned 18 and she's moving out
and moving to her own place soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you guys are creeps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leave her alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things have been busy and I stay
overwhelmed and overloaded, but I really
[SPEAKER_00]: do try to participate in the Patreon as
much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean the world to me that you take
money is expensive and you choose to take
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your hard earned money and funnel
it my direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it does keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it keeps all the gear updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some fresh paint on the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you see a new angle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done enough rambling, enough gushing,
enough shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've gone almost, almost 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the podcast portion of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about growing cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, somebody asked me recently,
uh, what do I need to grow three plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big of a space do I need to grow three
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to grow three plants,
somebody's got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in Colorado, we're allowed to grow six
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have three and veg, three and
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person does a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to design two spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to grow three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they said what, how much space do
I need to grow three plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things went off in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, well, you could grow three
plants in a little computer tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember those old school computer towers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about a foot tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about a foot wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably six or eight or about
foot tall, foot deep and six or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: inches wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's enough space to hang a small
light and you can grow three plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course your plants are going to be,
uh, six inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably be in a solo cup will be
their source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but they're going to be little tiny
plants, or you can have gigantic plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have vegged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can start vegging plants today and
not put them outside until next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to do so, if you have the
proper care and equipment for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three plants, uh, could be anywhere
from a six inch by six inch space to five
[SPEAKER_00]: acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it just depends on what you want
to do with these plants, how you care for
[SPEAKER_00]: them and what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need for three plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big are the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about your goal all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a goal, how do you
succeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phrase I use a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned it from a teacher in seventh
grade and I will never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Ms. Dodson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fucking try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hope, you can hope things come
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you could pray for shit to go right,
or you can do some work and set yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to set yourself up for success is
to know your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the end outcome desired goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look down the road and you say,
I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the goal there at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you really want to accomplish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to say, I want to grow
some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a logical fucking step right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much weed, how often weed,
what kind of weed, like realistically,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much space do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time can you commit to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in the budget?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does my electrical load in my house
or wherever I'm choosing to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that going to support?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your realistic goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a goal is the main objective to
starting any project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how big your plants going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much space are you going to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much herb do you want to produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you want to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to produce an ounce for
yourself every two months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to be Pablo Escobar and
fucking supply all of North America?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to have to set goals and
have a strategy to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, how big are your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to produce a bunch of product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to produce a little bit of
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the first things to start
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to produce as much product as
we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pull out seven pounds a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to be realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about electrical limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are you entering a criminal element by
growing so much herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it's all about your abilities,
your goals, your skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, are you growing auto plant auto
flower plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing regular photo period
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing autos, they're going to
start to flower when they become a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: size, you'll have to build a certain size
room for the auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to flower out around 18
inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll finish out about two, maybe three
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to build a space that will
support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're running auto or not autos,
excuse me, if you're running photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you control when they flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can veg them to be two inches tall
and then put them into flower and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pull off a gram and a half per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people say, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do that, you can cram
120 Rockwell cubes onto a six by six tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do 64, you could do 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you how you want to do it,
or you can put one big plant under one led
[SPEAKER_00]: or under one HPS light, or you could put
one plant and trellis it out and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: under four 1000 watt HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really know how to do the work,
it's all about your goal, your style and
[SPEAKER_00]: your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much space do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much electricity do you have
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of it is based on your veg time
and your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put, like I've said before,
you can take seedlings that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouting from seed in a Rockwell cube and
flower them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start flowering when they're just
two inches tall, they'll end up being
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe six inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you're done, they'll produce a
gram or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow 100 of them, 112 of them,
you'll grow somewhere between a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half a pound of weed, a quarter
pound and a half a pound of weed from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants this tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why don't people just go throwing out
200 little tiny plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plant count is what gets you in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we're allowed six plants
recreationally, six plants medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can have six plants in any household
that is an adult household.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a house, you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in most cases, I would assume,
uh, if you're an adult, you can have six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you have a medical marijuana
recommendation from your doctor,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been approved and certified and
registered with the Colorado department of
[SPEAKER_00]: public health and environment and the
marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I don't know if you have to
get the MED involved in that one is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado department of public health and
environment has to have a Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: registry, uh, on file for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can have six more plants in your
home, which allows you a maximum of 12
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, you are now illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are committing a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You now have an illegal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the cops are going to come,
you're going to get busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it happens a lot around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant count is why we change numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't just go throwing out 64
plants in a six by six tray and run them
[SPEAKER_00]: really quick to see what I've got and keep
the keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I've got to keep my numbers
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to play with a bunch of
little tiny plants on big trays under a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt lights would be the way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, limitations because of
legalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I'm limited by plant counts,
I grow my plants really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't tell me that I can't have
gigantic fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say I can have six of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grow six of them, the size of fucking
Volkswagen's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not do it that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not counting branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're counting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're counting pots and root zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got six of them, but they just happen
to look like fucking buses driving down
[SPEAKER_00]: the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you can put for three plants,
honestly, you could grow them in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you could make a clandestine grow kit
out of like a computer box or a little
[SPEAKER_00]: like a nightstand that you keep by the
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make that a grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need is a, an environment which
you can control the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a controllable dark
period where you can get a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: complete darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need an environment where you can
control the temperature and the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vapor pressure deficit is what that's
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VPD is very crucial, especially in a
small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to water, these little plants,
they start letting off water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's water in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get really humid in these little
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need a way to control
that VPD and that small space though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's really advantageous because you
can really dump the air out and replace
[SPEAKER_00]: the air super quickly in a small space
with something like a computer fan or a
[SPEAKER_00]: four inch inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really easy to do, but it's
critical that it is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need a light up top, just
something to keep those plants going as
[SPEAKER_00]: strong as you can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't create too much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That heat is going to get really high in a
little container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can build just a little box out of
a dresser, out of a nightstand,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that will seal up and keep the
light out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically that you can move some air in
and out of and control the environment in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what you really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get a good clean spot and then
airflow, I keep talking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow, no matter how big or small your
grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often overlook the idea of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I did the lights,
I did all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to replace that stagnant
air?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get air moving
through the canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to move air around in that grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you really need for three plants
is an area you can seal from light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need any light interruptions in
the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need an area we can control the VPD,
the temperature and the humidity is what
[SPEAKER_00]: that boils down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more we can evacuate the air and
replace the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more we can get some airflow in there
and then something we can put lights in
[SPEAKER_00]: and not burn our plants and melt our
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to build a little tiny
grow space, please be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people build little dressers and
light shit on fire because they put too
[SPEAKER_00]: much light inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put too much light in your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Mylar, if it touches the light,
eventually that shit will catch on fire
[SPEAKER_00]: and burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure the Mylar is stuck to the
wall as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even like Mylar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use PandaFilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit will melt if it touches the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you need for three plants is
basically up to your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people probably have room for a three
by three or a five by five grow tent in
[SPEAKER_00]: their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highly recommend a three by three
or a five by five grow tent with Canon LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith doesn't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Canon LEDs in a three by three
gorilla grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where I keep my small veg stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's where I honestly keep my
mail plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time those plants,
excuse me, those plants in that three by
[SPEAKER_00]: three with that one Canon LED are
extremely happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can get that grow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a three by three tent, a Canon LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a, is it a four or a six inch
blower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a small blower in there sucking
the stagnant air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that just ducks out of a window
because oftentimes I put a mail plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I want that carbon filter and
that exhaust going directly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen's going directly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if you grow in my backyard,
you're going to get pollinated possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me catch up on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see where we are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about how big of a plant you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you veg them for two weeks,
they'll be this tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you veg them for six months,
they'll be gigantic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can build a gigantic enclosure for
three plants, or you can have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: teeny tiny space for three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your desires, what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about putting a hundred or
120 Rockwell cubes under one LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all you have to do is veg those for
like a week or like 10 days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're this tall ish ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you flower them and you could
pull seven to 12 grams per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do a hundred plants times seven
to 12 grams, you're getting 700 to 1200
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of herb at the end, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it correctly, uh, that works out
pretty well in my opinion, but that many
[SPEAKER_00]: plants is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go bigger plants, trellis them out,
spread them out, maximize our space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's all about maximizing the space
you've got and having a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how much space you need
for your three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm going to start by recommending
that three by three, uh, grow tent with a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannon, led, a carbon filter and a blower
and put a fan inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should have you set up to rock
pretty good for a starter kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go five by five with two or three
cannons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then expand as time goes on, add more
tents at a veg tent, have a flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: have one in veg, one in flower or two in
flower all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a way to expand on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could give you a direct,
uh, do this, do this, but I would say get
[SPEAKER_00]: that three by three tent, put the cannon
led in there, get that set up and learn to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then expand anything smaller is going to
be kind of hard to, uh, control the VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need a hygrometer and a
thermometer, something that will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature and humidity in that
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at it all the time and see
what's going on in there and make
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I need to grow three plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a sealable environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can seal the light, you can control
the, uh, air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control the vapor pressure
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control who goes in and out of
their, uh, secure area somewhere that's
[SPEAKER_00]: clean somewhere that you can control the
bugs and the predators and the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that with bugs, with the,
uh, the little rodents and fucking animal
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic, something you can control.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is mainly what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clean workspace, anything else you can
turn it into a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is adjustable depending on your
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the best parts about
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no real, uh, you've got to do it
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will say, you'll see it in groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to top that plant now,
or you need to do this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say, why explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why explain why give me a paragraph of why
that needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it however you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are happy with the way the
plants come out in the end, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're always going to find room for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get raided or kill the plants or
flood the room, you might've done
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong, but we can recover from
most of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I answered that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it rambled on for quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, another note that I wrote was don't
let anybody else mess up your goal and
[SPEAKER_00]: your strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you want to grow your three plants
your way, you grow your three plants your
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just have to learn by doing
shit the way they do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did it the wrong way, you're going
to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did it the right way, you're going
to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the first time you grow, you'll say
my idea was just not fucking right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a half cooked idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I see why everybody on the
internet said that I was goofy for trying
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but guess what you learned and you
got to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let anybody mess up your strategy
or your goals or your ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm an experienced grower,
but, uh, you might have an idea that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can learn something from everybody,
from a grower who's doing his first day to
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower who's been there for a hundred
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can learn something from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that in the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can learn something from everybody on a
drum kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing goes for the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let me mess up your plans,
your ideas and your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let my knowledge and my experience and my
info, uh, have some effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your ideas, but don't let me make
decisions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like use my input as data and then weigh
your options with the data that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been given, but don't don't, you don't
have to follow me as gospel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I don't know what is
happening in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact specific
environment, the situation, the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, maybe, uh, maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of my ideas are expensive and
people say to solve that problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just gave me a $500 solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's what's going to fix
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our grow rooms and our plants are,
they require certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to cheap out and do shit,
the cheap way you really can, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get the cheap outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I run my grows like a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's a harvest, there is a profit,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that profit goes into the bank
because it's ran like a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a portion of that profit is put
back into the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to buy a new carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to buy new lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to buy maybe a new pH pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely need more nutrients,
new soil, probably some new pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay somebody to help you
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you trim it, they're going to get paid
for trimming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all gets invested back into the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as a seed maker, I buy seed
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a lot of components to my seed
packaging and then there are shipping
[SPEAKER_00]: components, a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all gets reinvested back into the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to invest in your
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are growing a product that's going to
give you a reward, whether it's medically,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's recreationally, whether it's
financially, there will be a reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to put something into it to get
something out of it, or you don't get out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will show you everything you put into
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put in laziness, your end product,
your photos on Instagram will show they
[SPEAKER_00]: will convey laziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put love, effort, energy,
pride, passion into your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowers and your photos will show
that even if you're not growing the most
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing product, the fucking 32% that
everybody's wanting to snap pictures of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll still feel, still feel pride in
that product and you'll learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve it because your ego is not in the
way you're growing from your heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: not from your wallet, not from knowing
about the profit, but put some pride into
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden, reinvest in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that you've got to reinvest in
this business and it will keep reinvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke that pro, you want it to
be, uh, not stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something I've noticed is,
uh, when I worked in, I use guitar center
[SPEAKER_00]: as a reference a lot, but this will make a
lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I would sell a little kid,
a shitty guitar or a shitty drum set,
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd come back in a couple of weeks
looking for something to add to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it fun again, because he ran out
of fun because the guitar or the drums,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter how well you play them and tune
them, they're going to sound like shit
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are cheap, shitty quality
instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just made to sell, to get money
in the bank, to make it look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: guitar, to take little kid money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that little kid would have invested,
I know it's his parents and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: blaming anybody, but this is how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the parent would have invested in a
high quality instrument in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would have gone home and had a chance
to sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to some, some pro
musicians are going to grab some shit gear
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, watch this bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a shitty drum set sound good,
but I've got skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a beginner drummer is never going to
make a shitty drum set sound like a rock
[SPEAKER_00]: star drum set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get them a good drum set to
sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I feel the same way with grow gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy the cheapest light,
you can get the cheapest soil you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheapest genetics you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have a good grow
because you've got a bunch of cheap shit
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always going to be a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is going to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants aren't getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting the right spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to grow wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got shitty soil in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't even have a chance to
develop healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to this soil sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're, you got shitty genetics
to begin with, and they're never going to
[SPEAKER_00]: perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like buying a shitty guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how many fucking pedals you run
it through, no matter how much compression
[SPEAKER_00]: you put on it, no matter how many books
you read, how many YouTube videos you
[SPEAKER_00]: watch that shitty Laguna guitar is always
going to sound like a shitty Laguna guitar
[SPEAKER_00]: that the fucking neck is going to bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to work right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy shitty gear for the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So invest in yourself, invest in your
garden and have a good time in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it fun, make it enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are saying Rasta Jeff,
I don't have the money to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can't do that on your first grow
your second grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing, now you're saving
money buying from the plug or the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that much money you're not spending
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then you've got that extra fundage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not spending the money,
or maybe, uh, you are putting it out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market and making a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore you should be reinvesting in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're growing black market,
it's a competitive market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be the best grower with the
best product and the most of it readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you're going to want to
step up your game.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going black market, you
definitely need to get the best you can as
[SPEAKER_00]: quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the guy down the block is working
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's watching my show also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get better than him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step your shit up, put some passion into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinvest that cheap shit is going to break
you guys in the middle of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cheap led is going to start going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to walk in there and
it's going to be flickering and flashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go, what is wrong with my
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to call the company and
they're going to be in China and nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you don't have a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in America, you bought a good
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that all the Chinese
companies are bad, but if you got a good
[SPEAKER_00]: company that was locally based in America,
you call them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say I got problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll either talk you through it or help
you get a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not shit out of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buy good gear, cheap shit breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often see people asking what is the best
cheap pH pen I can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two words are never going to be
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best and cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why best is the best and
cheap is the cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two things don't ever fall together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best isn't the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheapest isn't the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's there's fucking economy and logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why, but if you need a pH
pen, I always recommend getting a blue lab
[SPEAKER_00]: or something better than a blue lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the blue lab three in one combo
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the blue lab stuff because it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other meters that I've tried,
uh, they don't hold the calibration long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically, I just say they suck,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the blue labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I recommend, but cheap and
best will never be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we in all of my notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of notes here with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to skip some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, don't buy that knockoff stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people buy like knockoff lights or
knockoff stuff and then complain that it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't work as good as it should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought the knockoff shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend the real money, get the real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see that quality products,
a quality high end luxury product will
[SPEAKER_00]: make your grow experience much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just be more comfortable, more
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be a stressful, uh, it's just
easier when shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for you for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've gone for about 30 minutes
minus a couple of quick edits that you've
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably didn't even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I'm going to wind up this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
