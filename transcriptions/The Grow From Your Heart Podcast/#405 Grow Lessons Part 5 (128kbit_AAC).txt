[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode 405 of the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I'm taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia
from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The label says this is 66.3% THC with
77.8% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to the show a lot,
you know I am a big fan of the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a big fan of the Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a wonderful concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been
following along, you know that I have been
[SPEAKER_02]: reposting compilations of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be the final compilation of
reposted grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, we are going to revisit
episodes 389, 391, 393, 394, and 395.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank everybody again for
listening to these compiled grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado,
let's jump right in to these old grow
[SPEAKER_02]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for episode 389 of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_02]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you may know that I've been out of
town and I've been reposting old episodes
[SPEAKER_02]: that fall right in line with those grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode is going to be a repost,
but it is a good lesson on harvesting our
[SPEAKER_02]: ripe cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut out a long intro and I cut out all
of the advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's jump right into a lesson on
harvesting our ripe cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, let's do a podcast all
about harvesting your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done an episode about determining
when your plants are ripe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done an episode about flushing your
plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it is harvest time in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of things we need to
think about before we go in and cut down
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I should mention if this is
your first time cutting down cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, you thought they smelled strongly
when they were growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you cut those fuckers down,
it's going to double in smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds like I may be making it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is going to stink.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I grow one plant in a small house,
we'll say in the attic or the basement,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I chop that plant down and hang
it up in that attic or basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stink of that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So normally you can smell it to the living
room, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: To the living room of the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you harvest, you can smell that
shit to the driveway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the science behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's paranoia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's because we're moving
in and out of the grow room more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know exactly what it is,
but as soon as you cut down that crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to stink more than you were
expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So try to be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things you can do to be prepared are
maybe getting some ONA gels.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know what ONA gels are,
ONA gels are jars filled with this
[SPEAKER_02]: gelatinous substance that just eats up
odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't put out an odor, but it eats up
the odors in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you open the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to just set a jar of it behind a
house plant or behind a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to picture your daughter up on the
coffee table or up on the end table.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just stick one of these ONA jars
opened right behind it, and that just
[SPEAKER_02]: starts sucking up all the odor out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So put those by the doors and the
entryways of your house where people may
[SPEAKER_02]: come in, and that way you're sucking up
that odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, if you can't do the ONA
gels, maybe do something stronger to cover
[SPEAKER_02]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're spraying lilac air freshener,
you're going to smell lilac and weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ONA gels are going to be your best
bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to neutralize the odor would be
your best bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another good idea, if you can afford it,
would be a carbon scrubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us have a carbon filter that blows
air out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep that running because that's going to
keep filtering the air and make it smell
[SPEAKER_02]: good, but also get a carbon filter with a
blower on top of it and just plug it in
[SPEAKER_02]: and let that air run through the carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're just sucking stink out of
the air, cleaning up that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to stink.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is something we need to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now before we even start chopping down,
there's a few more things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are all of these plants going to go
once you cut them down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's plan this before we even get to
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to use those circular racks
that they sell at the grow store,
[SPEAKER_02]: the multi-tiered circle racks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to be able to make a line
somewhere with string and hang them?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a space that you're going to
be able to control the temperature and the
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity and hopefully keep the aroma
under control and hopefully keep light out
[SPEAKER_02]: and also keep people away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Start thinking about that around week six
or seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, let's not wait until week nine to
start figuring out where these plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start thinking about that early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need a place for them to hang that
you can control the temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: a place you can control the humidity and a
place you can keep people out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also you're going to have to control
that aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have a place prepared and keep in mind
that if you're going to dry your buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: if these buds hang in your dingy funky
basement, they're going to taste like
[SPEAKER_02]: funky dingy basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've tasted that smell on buds before
and you probably didn't realize why does
[SPEAKER_02]: this taste like the damn basement?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was dried and cured and hung
for seven days in somebody's funky,
[SPEAKER_02]: damn dirty fucking basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly why.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have some air exchange, have some
temperature control and have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys create a good environment for
your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've gotten them this far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not ruin them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in a grow hut and you
don't have another crop coming up right
[SPEAKER_02]: behind it, why not just use that grow hut
as your drying space?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would not be a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're controlling that environment
already anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is always an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create a good environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, and we'll talk more about the
space in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just use the grow room if you need
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have another crop coming up,
just use your flower room or move the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants into flower, use the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always an option, but we'll get
back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk more about the things we need
to prepare for before harvest time comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need a few tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black or the blue thin nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to be super thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just trying to not get sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, when you're trimming weed and
when you're harvesting, and handling this
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of weed, you're going to get
sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to wear just a long sleeve
over shirt that you could take off when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are going to stink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have an allergy to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a friend, if she rubs up against
a blue dream plant, she's going to break
[SPEAKER_02]: out into a giant rash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe cover yourself up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if your eye itches, do never rub
your eye with a trichome laden finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your eye itches and you're trimming
weed, take off your gloves and then itch
[SPEAKER_02]: your eye with a clean hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you've been trimming and not wearing
gloves, go wash your hands before you itch
[SPEAKER_02]: your eye or scratch your eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you get resin in your eye,
it is one of the most painful experiences
[SPEAKER_02]: you will ever endure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurts and it won't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what makes it stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just burns and burns and burns and it's
sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you blink, you expect it to feel
better, but it's just stickier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fucking miserable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gloves, a long sleeve shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also going to need some scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend quality scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy some cheap shitty scissors,
but they're going to break.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also recommend using a different pair of
scissors for cutting down the plants than
[SPEAKER_02]: you use for trimming the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're trimming, you're getting in
there and getting the fine details.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're cutting them down,
you're using brute force and cutting down
[SPEAKER_02]: tough plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need some thicker pruners.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need some choppers to cut down a
big plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how big your stock is,
but you want to be able to get in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and cut it down easily without hurting
your wrist, without breaking your
[SPEAKER_02]: scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like something that has got a metal
solid piece to it for cutting them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the plastic scissors for cutting them
down, metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two solid pieces of metal from the handle
to the blade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then also for trimming, that's when I like
the little fiskars, the diamond tips or
[SPEAKER_02]: something similar to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something to cut down the plants with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scissors, shears, whatever you're going to
use, be prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to have more than one
person doing the chopping down,
[SPEAKER_02]: get more than one fucking pair of shears.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing more frustrating than
watching people stand around and not able
[SPEAKER_02]: to do work because you don't have enough
scissors or you don't have the right
[SPEAKER_02]: tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to have a group of people
doing it, get a group of shears.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know most of you guys probably have a
small garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably one or two of you and you
don't need giant bolt cutter style shears
[SPEAKER_02]: or giant fiskars shears or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been in that situation before
where I'm watching five guys wait for work
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's just me with a set of shears.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shears chopping down every plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have enough shears, have enough gloves,
maybe get a few different sizes of gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to go buy a box of gloves,
buy two, maybe three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get small, medium and larges or maybe
small, large and extra large.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on who's coming over to help
you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're going to have people
helping, if they're going to be harvesting
[SPEAKER_02]: and trimming with you, maybe you want a
few different size gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have applied any pesticides to your
cannabis plants and you're going to cut
[SPEAKER_02]: them down and have other people work with
them, maybe you should politely let those
[SPEAKER_02]: people know what pesticides were applied
to your plants so that they can wear long
[SPEAKER_02]: sleeves, they can wear a mask,
they can dress appropriately based on
[SPEAKER_02]: their decisions, based on what pesticides
you have applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things don't bother me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things I would want to put on some
long sleeves for and not get that on my
[SPEAKER_02]: arms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just personal preferences, safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always polite anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next thing we should talk about is
how are we going to hang these plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the next thing you got to buy is
something to hang them on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to use... So the grow store
sells this really nice hanger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about three feet around and it hangs
in the middle and then it's got four or
[SPEAKER_02]: five shelves on it that you can just fill
with buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to cut your buds into small
pieces or your branches into small pieces
[SPEAKER_02]: and hang it on there, that's just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not the way I would prefer to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to hang the branches so that the
buds aren't touching anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that they don't get a flat spot,
so that there's not a spot where air can't
[SPEAKER_02]: flow around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just prefer to hang them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Colorado, we're allowed to grow six
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we've got a six plant harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get six coat hangers or clothes
hangers and then I would get some fishing
[SPEAKER_02]: line or some thick hemp twine and I would
anchor that to two opposite ends of the
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've just got a nice piece of string
hanging across the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can hang the plants on that string
if you want to, but if you're using
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple strains, maybe you've got six
different plants, maybe you've got giant
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you can cut the plant into
smaller pieces and put it on the coat
[SPEAKER_02]: hanger and you can label the coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all sour tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is all black cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you don't have one long line of
buds that get confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it makes more space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing you're going to need is some
sort of labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to get just some white duct
tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always just peel off a piece of
duct tape, write on that, stick it
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can get some real labels or you can
improvise however you need to,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're going to want labels if you've
got more than one strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing worse than getting shit
confused right at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got some way to control the
odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a place thought of and prepared
where you can control the temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: the humidity, the lights, the airflow,
the aroma, and the security.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got that all prepared and you've
got the proper tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got something to cut it down with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got something to hang it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about the room just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need, I would recommend,
a humidifier and a dehumidifier and also
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of exhaust fan to get the stale
air out of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a small space, you probably just
crack the door open, but if you've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of plants in there, you're going to
need to exchange some air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to get that humid air
out of there or the plants will never dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just get stagnant and funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I may recommend a small fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want air blowing directly onto
the buds, but you want to move that air
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't want it stagnant and funky
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want to be able to control the
climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you're going to need something to
tell you what's going on in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A thermometer, a hygrometer, perhaps a PL
grow unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want something in there so you know
what the temperature is and what the
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity is so you can adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it feels like we've talked a lot about
what to buy and how to prepare,
[SPEAKER_02]: so let's talk a little bit about the
settings in the room since we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about all this equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to put a humidifier and a
dehumidifier in the room, and I set them
[SPEAKER_02]: both at 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way I know that that room is staying
right around 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can set them up to something like a
PL grow unit or if you can set them up to
[SPEAKER_02]: something that'll treat you better,
trigger them to go off and on based on
[SPEAKER_02]: certain parameters, put them both at 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have the dehumidifier work to 50%,
have that humidifier work to 50%,
[SPEAKER_02]: and keep that room at 50% humidity as
consistently as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it may be a good idea to have some
sort of exhaust fan in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing major, just maybe a little four
inch exhaustor if you can do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you can just suck the air out of that
room occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would get that old stagnant funky air
out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that is not an option, open the door,
put a fan by the door, just make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: air exchanges occasionally so you don't
get old air in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now inside this room where you've got your
dehumidifier, your humidifier,
[SPEAKER_02]: and some air exhaust, try to keep it
somewhere around 70 degrees in that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: 65 to 75 degrees will be ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any hotter, you're gonna speed up the
drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also gonna get funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna increase humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any cooler, the room will start getting
too dry and your buds will get crispy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got your temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your humidity under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got some air exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put a small fan in the room,
perhaps on the floor just to keep the air
[SPEAKER_02]: moving around or up high in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it right in the middle
blowing on the plants too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gonna create a dry spot and just
dry out some of those buds too quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanna move the air around so it
doesn't get stale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually get one of those fans that would
sit on your computer desk, just a desk
[SPEAKER_02]: fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little tiny, like a 12 or 14 inch
fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that in the corner on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a small room, that is
plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just move the air around.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that sounds like we've got a
pretty good idea of a dry and cure space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, a small room or a grow tent
that you can control the environment in
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can hang those plants in safely,
securely, and in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to use a small closet,
you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure that door gets opened and
those buds don't get stale in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, like I mentioned earlier,
if you don't have sufficient drying space,
[SPEAKER_02]: go ahead and use the flowering room that
you flowered the buds in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe move your next round of plants
from the veg room into that flower and use
[SPEAKER_02]: your veg room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow tents always make nice dry and cure
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in a five by five tent,
you could easily dry your whole harvest in
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a three by three tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't be a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need that much room to dry your
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, hopefully you need a 10 by 10,
but that's not gonna be logical.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now we know what to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what supplies we're gonna need.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a safe space set up for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, you've been flushing your
plants for 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one more thing we should do before
we get to chopping these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: While they are still standing up,
we should go and take off all of the big
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any leaf that you can break off with your
hand now, just go ahead and take it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants don't need leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're about to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do this seven, five, three days
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do it right up before the moment
you harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start taking off all those big
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those leaves are unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to just go in and throw them right
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start tearing leaves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw them right on the floor and sweep up
when you're done, because there's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tear off all of the leaves you can
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need those.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gonna save you time when it comes
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna cut these plants down and let
them dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those long leaves are just gonna dry
on there and be in the way and smell
[SPEAKER_02]: funky, and they're a sticky bitch to work
through once they dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're much easier to get off now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just snap them right off of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: De-leaf this shit out of the entire room
before you cut down any of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they are all pre-defoliated,
that's what I call it, the pre-harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: defoliation, then it is time to start
chopping down these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I don't know how big your plants are,
but this is basically how I chop down a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kneel down, or if it's on a table,
whatever, I walk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually kneel down to one knee and I
grab the plant right above where I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got the stalk just a couple inches
above the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get my loppers or whatever you want to
call them, your pruners, your shears,
[SPEAKER_02]: and get in there and cut right above the
dirt, right below my feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I've got a little plant, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm in a three or five gallon pot,
I got this by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I've got a bigger plant, I will ask
somebody to help me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, dude, hold the top of this,
because when I cut it, it's gonna fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: timber down on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would get in there and cut it right
at the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have got maybe a tomato cage or
some trellising or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe figure out how to get the plant out
of there by cutting from the top down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to cut the whole plant out in one
piece and hang the whole thing upside down
[SPEAKER_02]: and let it all dry in one piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've put the plant in a screen of
green or a tomato cage, you may have to
[SPEAKER_02]: start at the top and cut out individual
branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that you keep each branch of
each strain together so that you don't mix
[SPEAKER_02]: anything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned earlier how frustrating that
shit is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't mix stuff up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So separate your plant, free your plant
from its tomato cage, free the plant from
[SPEAKER_02]: the trellis however you need it,
if you need to, then chop it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you've got the whole plant chopped
down in one piece, I get a fuzzy stick is
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're called.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell them at Hobby Lobby,
or you can use the twisty ties that come
[SPEAKER_02]: with your trash bags, because I never use
the twisty ties in the trash bags anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always end up for this purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrap the twisty tie around the base of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it securely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a branch in there because it may slide
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then tie that to either your coat
hanger or the line that you're gonna hang
[SPEAKER_02]: it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got the line hanging across the
room, attach it to that securely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang it on there in a way that you know
it's not gonna fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got to cut it down into
branches, try to cut to where you create
[SPEAKER_02]: little V-shaped intersections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you hang the plant upside down,
you'll see the little wishbone-shaped
[SPEAKER_02]: intersections that you can use perfectly
to hang your branches on your coat hanger
[SPEAKER_02]: or on your line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cut the plant, flip it upside down,
and just hang it in the size of sections
[SPEAKER_02]: that you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to cut your plant down into
smaller sections to make it fit,
[SPEAKER_02]: make the sections similar sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way they dry at similar speeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got one big piece and one little
piece, that big piece is gonna take longer
[SPEAKER_02]: to dry than the little piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna cause unevenness and you're
gonna be confused on what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chop everything if you're gonna chop
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it all hang in one big piece if you're
gonna let it hang in one big piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cut the plant at the base or pull out
the branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang them on the coat hanger either by
using the twisty ties and securing it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the coat hanger there, or just by using
the V-shaped intersections and hanging it
[SPEAKER_02]: like a little hook on the V-shaped
intersection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just get everything hanging safely in
your drying cure room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop everything down and just go hang it
all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna be super excited now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna wanna go post all your social
media about how you just took down your
[SPEAKER_02]: first harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do not do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is some old school advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't post any pictures or talk about your
harvest until it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's going out for retail, if it's
going into your jar, into your safe,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's when you talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk about it while that shit is
hanging in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk about it while you're trimming
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk about it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now, it's hanging in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you go to Walmart and you post
that to Facebook also, someone's going in
[SPEAKER_02]: your back fucking door and getting all
your weed and they're gonna trim it for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're never gonna see any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't post yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you're chopping down multiple
strains, carefully, carefully,
[SPEAKER_02]: carefully label these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll recap a little bit because I feel
like I went fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab it right above the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna flip upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold it upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either put one branch over your line that
you're gonna hang it on and let it hang
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a label on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or put it on a coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just slide the one branch through the coat
hanger so it's got one arm through and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's just hanging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on the coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or cut it into smaller pieces and do it
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Label the coat hanger what strain you've
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Label it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna hang there for somewhere
between five and 14, maybe a couple more
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen them go more than 14 days
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're on the coast where you've
got humidity, you may get some more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've chopped them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got them labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the lights, temperature,
humidity, and airflow all controlled in
[SPEAKER_02]: your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're just gonna have to wait
somewhere between five and 14 days for
[SPEAKER_02]: those sticks to start snapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you bend them, you just want them to
go crunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want them to explode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want them to just crumble up
like a whole bag of Doritos.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want them to snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want a bunch of moisture in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And check a few of them before you get
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they start snapping consistently,
that is when the dry phase has ended and
[SPEAKER_02]: it is time to work yourself into the cure
phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I did skip the part about putting them
on the dry racks that I talked about you
[SPEAKER_02]: could get from the Grow Store.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Grow Store sells these dry racks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like a 22 inch kick drum head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're about 24 inches around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're meshy and they're kind of cheap,
but they work really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just hang it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for this I would probably take the
buds off of the sticks and just put just
[SPEAKER_02]: the buds into those racks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't put the sticks in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the sticks are gonna take up a
lot of space in there and they also get
[SPEAKER_02]: stuck in the fucking netting a whole lot
and they're a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would cut every single bud off of the
stick if it were me and I would lay the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds in there and I would spread them out
kind of far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then every morning when I wake up,
I would go in there and just move those
[SPEAKER_02]: buds around and kind of shuffle them
around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the ideal way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand that some of us are
limited on space.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what you've got to do,
that's what you have got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather see you hang them until
they dry and get a little drier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as the stick snaps,
then get it off the stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand that sometimes you've got
to improvise.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of being a good grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to adjust, adapt and improvise
with what you've got when you've got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are so fucking spoiled now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got these giant facilities with
parking lots and security cameras and
[SPEAKER_02]: loading bays and friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started doing this,
you couldn't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't have your friends help you
carry your grow shit into the house
[SPEAKER_02]: because now they know you're growing and
they're gonna want something or they're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna fucking steal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need more space, you just call a
contractor and you get a building permit
[SPEAKER_02]: and you just build out another room and
you've got a dry and cure area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, we couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would catch people drying their
fucking weed in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you catch on later that he was
drying and curing his fucking weed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I got rambly there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dry racks are cool if that's what
you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I would prefer to hang it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer to hang it whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd prefer to hang it until it starts
snapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, that's when we enter the cure
phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you didn't have time or the
forethought to start defoliating your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants before you harvested, don't be
afraid to go in there and take off all the
[SPEAKER_02]: excess leaves while they're hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is never too late to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I feel like I can
re-crap what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably a recap would be better for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's recap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the appropriate tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the appropriate equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a good room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be able to control the
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want people getting in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to control the aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna need some gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna need something to hang your
plants on and you're going to need some
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of labels if you're growing more than
one string.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea to start
pre-deforestation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Defoliating, if you can get in there and
take off the leaves before, the chop down
[SPEAKER_02]: process is fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab it, chop it, hang that motherfucker
upside down and let it start drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to keep the drying cure room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want about 50%, about 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let those plants hang for four or five
days and start snapping the stems and see
[SPEAKER_02]: if they pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be five, seven, 10, maybe 14 days
before they're ready to go into
[SPEAKER_02]: containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when we're gonna jar them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we're gonna put them into
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when the cure process is gonna
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got a good grasp on how to
harvest our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step in harvesting, you guys,
is to get in there and clean and reset the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be time to buy new bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be time to change your air
conditioner filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is certainly time to clean the cover on
your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, maybe get in there and scrub the
lenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got glass lenses on your ducted
hoods, it's a good time to get in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and scrub that shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that everything is nice and
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the room with a clean, cleaning
product, maybe some bleach, maybe some
[SPEAKER_02]: Fizan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you've got, get in there and
clean the shit out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in the corners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in all the spots you've been missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you plan on using your grow room or
your grow hut as your drying space,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a good excuse, but you're gonna
have to clean it as soon as you're done
[SPEAKER_02]: with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as those plants come out of there
and you're trimming, you should take a
[SPEAKER_02]: break and go clean the shit out of your
grow space before you put more plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the completion of your harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is also the completion of your
harvest lesson, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the next episode, I have a guest
scheduled, so there will be another
[SPEAKER_02]: episode before the dry and cure episode,
but there is an in-depth dry and cure
[SPEAKER_02]: episode coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also talk about trimming a little
bit, and then I think we're gonna continue
[SPEAKER_02]: with grow lessons, and we're gonna start
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna go right into germinating
seeds and cutting clones and getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: grow started all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of fun things planned out
for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please stick around, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you will enjoy what I have planned
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I want to give some shout-outs.

[SPEAKER_02]: harvested cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this lesson, I'm going to repost
episode number 326, my original dry and
[SPEAKER_02]: cure episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ladies and gentlemen, let's time travel
back to episode 326, and let's recap
[SPEAKER_02]: drying and curing our freshly harvested
cannabis.

[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for episode 326 of the Grow

[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have got a very detailed episode planned
out for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be the long-awaited,
long anticipated dry and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have done an episode on determining
ripeness.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did an episode on harvesting your
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it is time to dry and cure our
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get there, let's cover a little
bit of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast is brought to you by my friends at
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hell of Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new regular or feminine seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend The
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell of Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, please support my

[SPEAKER_02]: Also, this podcast is brought to you by
our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should know what's going on in your
grow room at all times, and you can pay
[SPEAKER_02]: close attention with a PL Grow minder
unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check out my friends at PL Grow Systems
at plgrow.systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more order of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people let me know that the
episode with Deb and Granny and Giddyup
[SPEAKER_02]: and Max had an audio issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, that audio issue has
been corrected.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were frustrated listening to that
show, I encourage you to go back and check
[SPEAKER_02]: out the corrected audio version of that
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being patient with me and big
thanks to everybody who let me know there
[SPEAKER_02]: was a technical issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of technical issues,
I am still working with Stitcher to
[SPEAKER_02]: resolve the technical issues that happen
randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some episodes will play for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some episodes randomly will not play for
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only people experiencing the technical
issues are people who are listening to the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast through the Stitcher application
on an Android device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what's causing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought we had it narrowed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We corrected a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has done it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will keep working at getting that
resolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't listen to the episodes
through Stitcher, through the application,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can always go to the Stitcher website.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find the show there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you can find the show on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to keep all the episodes
updated on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize if Stitcher is fighting
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tech team and the customer support
team at Stitcher are helping me,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we cannot find the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've gotten most of the
technical business out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into a podcast, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I like to start the episodes off
by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I've got the honor of dabbing some
sauce made by a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was locally grown and locally
extracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy doesn't want to be mentioned on
the show, so I'm not going to say his
[SPEAKER_02]: name, but dude, thanks for the great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend grew some cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I bred the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cream is cookies and cream to a rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I passed along some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He harvested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He extracted and made sauce out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he was kind enough to bring me a
couple of sample jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys, this stuff is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost gone because it is so
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought me a little sample of straight
isolated crystals.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought me a little sample of straight
isolated turps, and he also brought me a
[SPEAKER_02]: sample of the two combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the crystals, and then I've got
the saucy mixture put together at a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, the mixture smells like cupcake
frosting and cookie dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you take a dab of it,
it tastes like you just took a big bite of
[SPEAKER_02]: cookie dough with cupcake frosting on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you blow it out,
it smells like somebody's baking fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like warm chocolate chip and
cinnamon cookies filling the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: This concentrate is excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is super smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a couple of gigantic dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no throat tingle.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no heaviness on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super delicious concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I know you don't want me to say your
name on the air, but great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a hell of a job with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is that it is almost
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've probably got one or two dabs before
this stuff is extinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bro, come back with a bigger jar and
let's make a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I'm obviously loving
these cream dabs grown and extracted by a
[SPEAKER_02]: local farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey bro, great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, this episode is going to be
really long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got all of the opening business
covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab, probably the last
two dabs of this cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I get back, I will give a long
lesson on drying and curing your freshly
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am ready to talk about drying and
curing your freshly harvested cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let me do a quick update from the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last episode, we talked about
harvesting your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about cutting them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about hanging them in a room
upside down in a climate controlled room.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I failed to mention,
you should only hang one crop in a space
[SPEAKER_02]: at a time to prevent re-moisturizing the
first crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cut down one crop and then let it
hang for four or five days, five or seven
[SPEAKER_02]: days, and then bring in a fresh crop and
lock that in the same room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what you're doing is just
introducing a whole bunch of moisture into
[SPEAKER_02]: that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just going to go into the other
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to re-moisten the other
plants and make them take longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you've got to kind of restart your
dry and cure process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one crop at a time is ideal hanging in
the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I should have mentioned
on the episode before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't remember to mention that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we are up to speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's actually get into drying and
curing our freshly harvested cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now after spending four weeks in veg,
eight to 10 weeks in flour, you really
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to mess these plants up at the
very end here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Curing is a very critical process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Curing, you can make the most delicious
buds taste like total shit from drying and
[SPEAKER_02]: curing them improperly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ruin the entire crop at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get too scared because I'm going to
guide you through not ruining it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but keep in mind that this is one of the
most critical parts in the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge process and a lot of things
can go wrong if you don't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take your time and pay attention and
don't rush to smoke your new crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've waited, what do we say,
about 14 weeks probably is what we did the
[SPEAKER_02]: math on, 120 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've grown these plants for 120 days is
about how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not wait a couple of days longer until
they are perfect before you start smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into actually drying and
curing these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the last grow episode was a harvest
episode and it left us with our plants
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging upside down in a room with proper
temps, proper humidity and minimal light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've been waiting for the sticks for
our plants to snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got plants hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just waiting for the right humidity
within the plants for the sticks to pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sticks should snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're waiting for them to snap but not
explode.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you grab a branch of the plant and
you just bend it, you want it to sound
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it to go, you don't want it
to explode with dryness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it to fall apart and you
don't want it to be gummy or rubbery or
[SPEAKER_02]: bendy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it to bend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to snap and pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sticks should snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bigger sticks and larger plants are
going to take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skinnier sticks and smaller plants are
obviously going to dry more quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: because they don't hold as much moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you took off less leaf or more
leaf, they're going to dry more quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: with out the leaf and they're going to
take a little longer with that extra leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: on there because it's going to hold more
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be more moisture in the room,
just more moisture overall to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're waiting for is those sticks
to snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the sticks snap, that's when the
container curing process begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use two different methods for this based
on crop size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget that I run commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a commercial setting, we do things a
little differently than we would do in a
[SPEAKER_02]: home setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to pulling down 50 or more pounds
in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want a bunch of jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really have the space for a
bunch of jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have the manpower to open a
bunch of jars all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do things a little differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a home grow, it's not as many pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use jar technique in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk about the way I would do it
in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a commercial grow, I'll chop the large
stalk and naked stems out of the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and place the buds still on sticks into
large rubber made containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a big plant, you've lolly
popped up probably 12 to 18 inches of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got some naked sticks,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I mean by naked sticks,
the shaved legs and that main big stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll cut all of that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes to waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a commercial grow, that's actually got
to be weighed and documented as removed
[SPEAKER_02]: waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I've got two piles.
[SPEAKER_02]: One pile is naked sticks that need to be
documented as waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be chipped up and thrown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's another pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the usable product of the sticks
with buds up it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to be trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those buds still on the sticks get put
into the rubber made containers untrimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carefully label your rubber made
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not label the lids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never label lids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a facility, in a home grow,
don't label the lids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lids are interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Label the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chop the sticks out, put the good
usable buds into the rubber made
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't squish them in there too tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill it up pretty well, but don't cram
anything in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need some air space in there and you
don't want to smash anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's too tightly pressed together,
it'll get funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll start to smell bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moisture will get trapped in there and
you'll start to get that stale ammonia
[SPEAKER_02]: smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we were trying to avoid
with proper drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would go through and remove all of
the sticks, get all the good buds into the
[SPEAKER_02]: containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once they are all completed,
I would go through and put the lids on
[SPEAKER_02]: every container at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have everything labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd all be sitting open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we're done with every plant
that's going to get binned that day,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's when I start putting the lids on
and sealing up the containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I feel like I haven't described these
containers properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: These rubber made containers are like the
size of maybe a laundry basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about three feet wide,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe a foot or so wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I said wide, but three feet long
and a foot or so wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then probably about 18, maybe 20
inches deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the one that you use for packing
or you just put a bunch of clothes in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, just a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's the one when the kids come to the
front door and they're trying to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: candy for church.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got some candy for church there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to raise some money?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get the big rubber made
container.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the container I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a moving box or something
is what it looks like, a storage
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can fit three or four large plants in
those containers from the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I should have mentioned that a
little earlier, but it just dawned on me
[SPEAKER_02]: that I did not describe these containers
in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now let's talk more about what happens
to these plants once they are put into
[SPEAKER_02]: this container and the lid is put on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to be opened and rotated every
day until they're dry enough to seal up
[SPEAKER_02]: without risking any mold development.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first day is always scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you seal them up and then leave
overnight, that is always a scary feeling
[SPEAKER_02]: until you get there the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to leave them open if you
feel like they're a little too moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cut them down and get them in the
bin and realize, oh shit, a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: these are too wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to leave those open
overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would rather leave them open and get
them a little too dry than close them up
[SPEAKER_02]: and get them a little funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little funky doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little too dry we can work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you seal them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put the lids on them and then you
might want to check on them before you
[SPEAKER_02]: leave for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that nothing needs to be
rotated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing needs to be flipped around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing needs to be left open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, if it needs to be left open,
leave it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're going to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to come back the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a bunch of sealed
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to be popped open immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would pop them open for four,
maybe six, maybe seven hours and check on
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: While they were sealed, a lot of the
moisture that was inside those sticks
[SPEAKER_02]: reconstituted throughout those buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of moisture built up in that
container.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find a lot of spongy and
wet buds when you come in in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to leave it open and get some
of that shit out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to open it up every day and let
that stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they start getting dry again,
some of the sticks might not even snap
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them may have re-moistened to
where they don't snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you may have gone just a little
bit too early, but it's not bad because we
[SPEAKER_02]: can get that moisture out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it to get too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to pop them open.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see how wet they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave them open.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may just want to leave them open for
an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're real dry, an hour is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four to six hours is not uncommon on the
first day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you chop those plants down or if you
bend those plants a little bit too early,
[SPEAKER_02]: they may be really wet and you may have to
leave them open for four to six,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the whole shift of eight to 10
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may have to stay open.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try not to cut them down and put them into
the bins so early next time, but you'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something you're going to have to
dial in with your facility and with your
[SPEAKER_02]: technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the duration of burp time is going to
decrease slowly as the buds dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: These bins are going to sit in a room
ideally that is at 50% humidity and 70
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees until you have time to trim them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a humidifier and a dehumidifier at
the same time and they're both set at 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that room gets to 55% humidity,
that dehumidifier kicks on immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it gets to 45%, the humidifier comes on
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get out of that 10 degree range
and it stays pretty close with both of
[SPEAKER_02]: those machines and they're fighting each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pretty much just stay on all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got these buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are in containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have not been trimmed yet and they
still need to be burped on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing the dry and cure manager
or the trim team manager should do when
[SPEAKER_02]: they get to the grow is pop open these
bins and see what type of situation you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be getting drier and more
smokable and they should start smelling
[SPEAKER_02]: more like dank cannabis every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fresh, green, wet smell should be
going away, but you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: pop them every day and pay attention to
how long they need to be opened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, that first day, you're going
to get four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the second day, four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the third day, four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the fourth day, three hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then maybe you're just going to have to
pop them open for an hour every day and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what's going on and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, you won't have to open them
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've gotten them to about 65%
humidity inside the container,
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently, you don't have to burp it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is cured where you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also in that room with 50%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to stay about 50% humidity
and it won't get less than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the containers hold moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to stay above 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while you're drying and curing inside
those bins, be sure to burp the bins every
[SPEAKER_02]: day and rotate the buds to prevent mold
and funky aromas until they get dry enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to leave alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to take the buds and pick
them up right outside of the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: And flip them over and set them back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the buds that were on the bottom
are now on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that once or twice a day if you
feel like you need to, if they are really
[SPEAKER_02]: wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I want to keep stressing is if
they are too moist, don't be afraid to
[SPEAKER_02]: leave the lid off the containers until the
buds are nice and dry and you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable closing them up and you're
sure there's not going to get any mold in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you leave it closed for too
long or you bend these buds too early,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to create an ammonia type,
funky, terrible mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: smell inside your buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to burn well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to taste terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to smell funky and it's not
going to be desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not going to be able to sell it
at your dispensary or however you plan on
[SPEAKER_02]: selling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one problem you may run into if you
leave it closed too long is funky aromas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing you can do to fix that is
try to air it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just leave it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to let that smell go away and it's
probably not going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've probably gone too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure not to seal it up for too
long and make sure not to seal it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's too moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another problem you could run into during
the drying and curing process is the buds
[SPEAKER_02]: could get too dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your buds get too dry in those
containers, a trick you can do is to go
[SPEAKER_02]: pull a few leaves from your growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a flower room, you probably
need to defoliate a little bit and pull
[SPEAKER_02]: some plant, pull some leaves off those
flowering plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go get, I would say four to six large
leaves per Rubbermaid container is more
[SPEAKER_02]: than enough to rehydrate some semi-dry
buds in one of those containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to put too much in there and it
made it really wet really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So four to six leaves is more than enough
to re-moisten an entire Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_02]: container if you left it open just a
little bit too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got it down into that Colorado
crunch zone, then you've done fucked up
[SPEAKER_02]: and you might not be able to fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll talk about that a little bit
later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you didn't go too far, just grab
four or five, maybe six leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: throw them in the container and seal it up
for just a few hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then go check on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That moisture will reconstitute the buds
and give you a second chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not recommend using anything other
than cannabis leaves, maybe Boveda packs,
[SPEAKER_02]: Boveda packs, however you like to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Boveda packs commit 62% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use those if you'd like,
although I do not prefer them myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they make a weird flavor in my
cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that using the leaves of the same
plant is the best idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that is basically the
commercial grow version of drying and
[SPEAKER_02]: curing your cannabis plants on a large
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to take a giant dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we get back, we will talk about
drying and curing your cannabis on a
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller scale for the home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, podcast world, let's get back
into this dry and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: The home grow or the connoisseur version
of drying and curing your final product is
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit different than the commercial
grow version, but it's basically the same
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to slow down the drying process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to get those buds to feel nice and
sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to smell nice and sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to burn nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how I would dry and cure my
product in a small connoisseur batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a smaller grow, a home grow or a
boutique grow, or maybe something I was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to enter into a competition,
if this was going into a cup, this is how
[SPEAKER_02]: I would cure my product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main difference is that I would not be
using the gigantic Rubbermaid containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use quart size, wide mouth glass
jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to use bigger jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like maybe too much moisture gets
stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the same conditions that you
create in those Rubbermaid containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the smaller, more focused jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another note before we get too far,
make sure you label each jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working with more than one
strain, label the jars, not the lids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lids are interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful with this, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working with different
phenotypes, label the jar whatever Arise
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenotype 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arise Phenotype 3, if you're running a
pack of seeds or whatever, label the jars
[SPEAKER_02]: so that you know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, everything up to the point of
the sticks snapping is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're waiting for the sticks to snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the sticks snap, that's when we can
start the jar curing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: For jar tech, I would take the snappy
sticks and chop off every bud into a
[SPEAKER_02]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get all those buds off the sticks,
into the bucket, throw those sticks away,
[SPEAKER_02]: get rid of them, do whatever you do with
them, compost them, shred them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toss them, those are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, I hand trim the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do another episode all about hand
trimming the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like trim machines, and I don't
like wet trim, but I'll talk about that in
[SPEAKER_02]: the trimming episode that is coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trim the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be dry enough by now to knock
off most of the leaves with your thumbs
[SPEAKER_02]: and thumbnails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim them up pretty closely with your
thumb, then put the trimmed buds into the
[SPEAKER_02]: glass jars that we talked about,
the wide mouth quart size mason jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill those jars about 75 to 90 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 percent full.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your buds are fluffier, if your buds
are bigger, you're only going to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get 75 percent in there because of all
the air space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got smaller buds, you can put up
to 90 percent in there, but do not press
[SPEAKER_02]: them down into the jar and don't overpack
them and don't squish them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want them lightly sitting in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once the jar is full, I add the lid
and I set a timer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to check my buds about four hours
after being sealed up for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This first check lets me see how much
moisture is trapped in my buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the inside of the jar is extremely
humid, I'll just leave that lid off for an
[SPEAKER_02]: hour or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the commercial grow, we were talking
about four to six, maybe eight hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe even 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are much larger plants, much larger
batches, and much larger containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is much more moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for these smaller jars, I only want to
leave it off for a little bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: These smaller batches can get away from
you quite easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how humid it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's really humid and really squishy,
you're going to want to leave it open for
[SPEAKER_02]: an hour, maybe a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep checking on it and do not forget
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set another timer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the humidity has not made the buds
squishy again, I'll leave the jar open for
[SPEAKER_02]: only like 15 to 30 minutes to let the
moisture out and that old funky air out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it'll kind of refresh with fresh
air in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll reseal the jar and let it sit
for another four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I set a timer for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in four to six hours, I pop that jar
and I gently stir the buds around and
[SPEAKER_02]: check the aroma that comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm looking for when I smell is an
aroma of ammonia or funk, or just you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: notice it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your nose will crinkle up and your eyes
will make a weird squint.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll go, fuck, I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for that aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that's not present.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm looking to see if it smells less
wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has it gone from that wet, juicy hay smell
to more of that cured, chronic smell that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it'll start doing it quickly and
then it will improve over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm cracking the jar open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking to see how much humidity is in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stir them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the buds seem damp or extra spongy,
at this point, I'll dump them out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: jar and let them sit for a few minutes
until that excess moisture evaporates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want the buds super soggy and
sealed in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want the buds super wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they still feel wet and spongy on the
outside, I'll dump them out and let them
[SPEAKER_02]: sit out for a few minutes until they feel
dry on the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you squeeze them, they're mushy
still a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want them dry on the outside,
wet on the inside is what you're going for
[SPEAKER_02]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the buds are sticking together,
then I dump them out completely and let
[SPEAKER_02]: them dry more before putting them back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we want a little bit of moisture in
these buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little bit of moisture is going to
make the drying and curing process happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't want enough moisture to cause
mold and funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we burp the jar about every four hours
to make sure we don't seal too much water
[SPEAKER_02]: in the jar for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We let some of the curing process happen
by opening the jar, letting that old gas
[SPEAKER_02]: out that contains the chlorophyll,
that contains the sugars, that gas
[SPEAKER_02]: evaporates out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We replace it with fresh air.
[SPEAKER_02]: We seal it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when we seal it, it's allowed to
restart the curing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll start deteriorating and eating up
more of that chlorophyll, more of those
[SPEAKER_02]: excess minerals and sugars and side of
there and they will start evaporating out
[SPEAKER_02]: of your buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the first couple of days,
you can slowly increase your burp
[SPEAKER_02]: intervals as the buds get drier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may only need to open these jars up
every six to eight hours after a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the time that you leave them open will
also decrease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe after a few days, you pop it open
every eight hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you pop it open right before you go
to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You leave it open while you're brushing
your teeth and getting your shoes on and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you close it up and you leave,
you come back from work and then you pop
[SPEAKER_02]: it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably been 10 hours by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop it open again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stir the buds around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure nothing's gone funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: If nothing's gone funky, just leave it
open for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let that air exchange in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seal it right back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can go 10 hours and you know
you're safe at 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what happens at 11 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what happens at 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start stretching it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of two weeks, you'll just be
popping these jars open once a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll give it a good smell and you'll
say, that is so close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can close it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of two weeks, these buds will
be beautifully, beautifully cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bud should be sticky on the outside
and spongy, but not dry and crumbly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should almost have a little bit of
squeeze, a little bit of give to them and
[SPEAKER_02]: then stick to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They shouldn't fall apart and just crumble
up like a lot of the Colorado dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: bud does, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that, you guys,
is because it's sitting on the shelf out
[SPEAKER_02]: there all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're opening up those jars and showing
it to you all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff is just getting dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the problem with the Colorado
crunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growers work hard to get it proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's sent to the dispensary and
left in those jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bud tenders don't do us justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on day one, I chopped the buds off the
sticks and I trim them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I fill the jars about 90% full.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I seal the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I check the jar in about four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I open it long enough for the excess
moisture to come out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of depends on how wet the buds
were when you jarred them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I check it again in about four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shuffle the buds if I feel that's
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's likely necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I check again in four to six hours
and leave open as necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're getting too sticky again,
I'll dump them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll want to check as soon as you wake
up the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The burp process will slow down over the
next few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to take as long as possible
without allowing mildew to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to slow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer it takes, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more time that it takes for that
moisture to come out, the more opportunity
[SPEAKER_02]: you have for chlorophyll to be removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing to worry about,
very similarly to the Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_02]: technique, is trapping too much moisture
in your containers for too long and
[SPEAKER_02]: causing yourself mildew or funky flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you locked your buds up in these jars
long enough to where you got white moldy
[SPEAKER_02]: webbing growing on there and it looks like
some cotton coming out, you fucked up and
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't pay any attention, throw that away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your jar is starting to get an ammonia
smell, you've sealed it up too long and
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to open it more frequently and
longer next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be able to save it, but it's
unlikely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing you can do is leave it open
and let it dry out and hopefully that
[SPEAKER_02]: smell will go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't leave it closed too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let mildew happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let that funky smell happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you're past the first few days,
you'll kind of be out of the mildew danger
[SPEAKER_02]: zone, but still be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, keep your jars in a cool,
dark place while you're curing your buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also don't leave them somewhere where
you're going to forget about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, here in Colorado, I'm running a
swamp cooler in the main portion,
[SPEAKER_02]: the living area of my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go dump your buds on the table near
the swamp cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not going to do you any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to reconstitute them and
make them wetter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about, wetter, is that a word?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, think about the environment where
you were drying and curing your products.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to dump them out on the
table in an attempt to get them more dry,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that the room is drier than the
bud or it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep that kind of stuff in mind,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about your products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like we've got a basic
understanding of how to cure our buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's get into the technical talk
about why we do it and what's technically
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So curing your buds properly makes your
buds burn and smoke smoothly, and it also
[SPEAKER_02]: brings out the best flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proper drying and curing will also
increase your potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because your buds contain chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chlorophyll is what gives your buds that
harsh smoke and hay-like flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: that burn-your-throat kind of funky
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from too much chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from excess minerals in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could also be from an improper flush,
but it's usually from an improper cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So curing the buds will remove chlorophyll
and increase your potency at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way to remove chlorophyll is by
turning it into a gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealing our moist buds in a jar creates an
environment that will break down the
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorophyll and turn it into a gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darkness, moisture, and oxygen will create
a bacteria within the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bacteria will break down the sugars
and leftover minerals created by the
[SPEAKER_02]: decomposition of the chlorophyll,
and it will turn into a vapor that can
[SPEAKER_02]: escape the jar when you pop it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what I was talking about earlier
when I said we pop open the jar and let
[SPEAKER_02]: the chemical reaction happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this process is going to make your bud
burn smoother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to bring out the proper aromas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to bring out the proper terpene
profile that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's also going to increase the
overall potency of your finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you really want to nerd out and
dial this in and create a connoisseur
[SPEAKER_02]: product, find yourself a hygrometer that
fits inside of your mason jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple available that fit
right inside the mason jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can press it up to the front of the
jar to where you can read the display
[SPEAKER_02]: without opening the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find yourself hygrometers that will fit in
the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are some suggestions on when to
open and close your jars and how to dial
[SPEAKER_02]: them in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your buds feel wet or if they are above
70% humidity, if the little display on
[SPEAKER_02]: that hygrometer inside of your jar reads
above 70% humidity, you need to dump those
[SPEAKER_02]: buds out of the jar and let them dry until
they get to 65 to 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when you dump them out and you leave
them somewhere that's not by the fan,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not by the swamp cooler,
that's not by the air conditioner,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not by something that's going to
drastically affect the rate of their
[SPEAKER_02]: drying, don't forget about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set a timer and go find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you are a little obsessive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're definitely not going to forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you are going to take a couple of
dabs and go play Fortnite, and your buds
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to dry up to shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let that happen, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they are too humid, dump them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them dry out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them down to 65 to 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if your buds feel moist to the touch,
if they're sticky and wet to the outside
[SPEAKER_02]: of the buds, and the display reads 65 to
70% humidity, pop the lid off of that jar
[SPEAKER_02]: for 15 to 30 minutes and let a little
moisture evaporate out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think they need longer than 15 to
30 minutes, let them go longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, don't start playing
Fortnite and start building shit and
[SPEAKER_02]: shooting people and forget about them
because you don't want them to get too
[SPEAKER_02]: crunchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 15 to 30, maybe 45 minutes,
maybe an hour, seal them back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set yourself a timer to remember to check
on them in a little bit, and now you can
[SPEAKER_02]: go play Fortnite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now your goal is 60 to 65% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that hygrometer to read between
60 and 65% humidity, and you want them dry
[SPEAKER_02]: but not crunchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to feel squishy and sticky
hopefully, but they're not wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want them dry but not crunchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might need to let your buds sit out
for a little bit before you roll a joint
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's cured perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The display will say 60 to 65%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need to take a couple of buds out
of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And set them, I just set them right here
on the front of my computer if I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to roll one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little warmer right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let them chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not like in the path of the fan or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let them chill right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm going to roll a joint with
in a few minutes and just let them sit
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you know, just for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just maybe if I'm going to go to lunch and
come back and smoke a joint, I'll set them
[SPEAKER_02]: out right before I go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go to lunch and then you come
back and then they grind up nice and fine
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're still sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still juicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your joint burns super smoothly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your joints not burning super
smooth, then you probably have too much
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to let it dry and cure just a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you hit that 55% or lower mark,
you're entering what I call the Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: crunch area and your buds are going to
burn too fast and you're also losing
[SPEAKER_02]: weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working with more than a quarter
pound there and you're drying it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you risk losing, you know, a quarter of an
ounce or whatever depends on how much you
[SPEAKER_02]: let it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your buds get too dry, don't add
anything funky to rehydrate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I would use are fresh
cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little bit goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take them out when the moisture comes
back and don't let those leaves mold up in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and fuck up your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check on them frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put wet leaves inside of either
your curing jars or your packs or your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking turkey bags, however you do it,
make sure you take them out and don't
[SPEAKER_02]: leave them for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check on them after an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: One hour is more than enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set yourself a timer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get stuck doing an Instagram live
video and forget to check on your buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to take a little bit for you
to get to where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if it's jumping real fast,
go ahead and pull it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave that jar open.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means it's really humid in there and
that you're just going to seal it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: cause problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a little tiny hygrometer in
our jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're watching the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get ourselves to 60 to 65%
humidity inside of those jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you don't forget about your
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you don't get that funky aroma
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it doesn't smell like ammonia
and mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you don't ruin it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be paying attention to the
number on the hygrometer and then pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: some buds out and seeing what they feel
like so that you know what 50,
[SPEAKER_02]: what 60, what 70, what 80% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get to 80, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that you know what the percentage
of humidity feels like inside these jars,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the bud feels like, this will give
you a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start paying attention to that stuff and
you will get ahead of the drying and
[SPEAKER_02]: curing game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once you've gotten your buds dried
and cured to 55 to 65% humidity and you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't see any fluctuation inside that jar
on the hygrometer, you only need to crack
[SPEAKER_02]: them open to check
[SPEAKER_02]: on them or pull out some buds to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So,
[SPEAKER_02]: ladies and gentlemen, that is my dry and
cure episode.

my website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually bought a MacBook.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to pay for the MacBook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually buy these little microphone
covers so that when Granny and Giddy are
[SPEAKER_02]: on, they don't have to spit into these
same microphone covers over and over
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are things like that that do need
to be covered and I do appreciate the
[SPEAKER_02]: support.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know that it's an option,
you don't know how you can help out.

[SPEAKER_02]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took a ridiculous dab of Mandarine
Sunset from Contraband Extracts available
[SPEAKER_02]: at a cut above in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This concentrate has a great aroma and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is sweet, orange and candy with a hint
of pepper and spice at the back end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the high is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes straight to my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes straight behind my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of makes it hard to think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it hard to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is exactly what I'm looking for
in a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to our friends at Contraband
Extracts and a big shout out to everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: at a cut above.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have been following along with the
podcast, you know I've been doing a long
[SPEAKER_02]: series of Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be another Grow Lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is going to be a reposted
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: A while back, I did an episode about
trimming our freshly harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally posted as episode 327.
[SPEAKER_02]: It falls right in line with our Grow
Lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to repost it as episode 393.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody enjoys this repost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, let's jump right in
to trimming our freshly harvested
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.

[SPEAKER_02]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode 327 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I like to start the episode off
by letting you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I'm taking dabs of this New York
City Diesel Ambrosia Batter from
[SPEAKER_02]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving it a nice smell right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff smells like diesel fuel with a
little bit of lemons, maybe a hint of
[SPEAKER_02]: oranges, and then there's kind of a sweet
tart sort of smell on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing about the New York City Diesel
Ambrosia Batter here that I'm smoking on,
[SPEAKER_02]: my eyes really don't get red when I smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smoke, and I don't get red-eyed,
but when I take one dab of this New York
[SPEAKER_02]: City Diesel, my eyes go fully bloodshot
red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what does it, but I get super
red, I get super head-hide from it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that weren't enough, I've been adding
this Sour Amnesia High-Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: Full-Spectrum Extract into the mix,
and it just adds a really nice ... It's
[SPEAKER_02]: like turbocharging my dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the lung expansion and the flavor
from the New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you put the High-Cannabinoid
Full-Spectrum Extract on top, and it
[SPEAKER_02]: really makes it like a turbocharged dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the mood for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I feel super rambly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I got a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode is going to be all about
trimming your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've learned how to tell when the plants
are ripe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've learned how to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've learned how to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learned how to hang them until they're
ready to snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know pretty well how to dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's talk about trimming our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there are two different ways you can
trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's wet trim and there is dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely prefer dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you're going to say, why is dry trim
better?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think dry trim is better because it's
less sticky and it's much easier to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also less work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves are dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those leaves are going to fall off.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is just brush them with
your thumb, maybe touch them with the
[SPEAKER_02]: scissors, and those brittle leaves will
come right off of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds have dried and tightened up,
and it's a little more obvious for a new
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmer what to take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to take off that fluffy
outside shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little less work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less sticky, and there's also less
chance to ruin your buds by improperly
[SPEAKER_02]: storing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, once the buds are
trimmed, if they wet trim, they like to
[SPEAKER_02]: just shove them into a container or a
package, and then those wet buds go into a
[SPEAKER_02]: container, and that's when they get
ruined.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not even going to let that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to let the buds dry,
then we're going to trim them,
[SPEAKER_02]: then we'll put them in a container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a lot of people have listened to the
dry and curing episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be trimming these buds before they
go into the jar for cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be trimming these buds after
they've been in the cure jar for a little
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the same process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves should be similar in dryness.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should just be popping right off of
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not even need scissors for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when I'm dry trimming,
the only thing I use my scissors for is
[SPEAKER_02]: for cutting the plant into smaller pieces
and cutting the sticks out and cutting the
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger buds down to smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's talk about a few preparations
we can make and a few items we can have to
[SPEAKER_02]: create a comfortable and successful trim
environment for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trimming sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're sitting in a chair with your elbows
up high, staring straight into something
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your neck, your elbows, your eyes,
your back, that stuff all gets sore and
[SPEAKER_02]: tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's try to make it as comfortable as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have a nice clean space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this table where I like to do my
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I clean the whole table off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing on the table except my Dr.
Pepper and some trim supplies,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe my phone for some entertainment,
but it's just there for music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be touching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't have your phone out if you're
trimming, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fucking distracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will slow you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll take twice as long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put on a podcast, hit play, start fucking
trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I like to have the table nice and
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need shit in my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need maybe my scissors for cutting my
buds into smaller pieces and then just a
[SPEAKER_02]: few basic essentials and we'll talk about
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice clean space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like a nice comfortable chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be sitting there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a cozy chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a nice clean workspace and a cozy chair
are super important for me for trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you need some sort of
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you got somebody there to talk
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I got Mike or somebody around to
bullshit with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some sort of conversation makes trimming
go much more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have that option,
put on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I like to put on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I recommend old episodes of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put on some Joe Rogan, something like
that, maybe a YouTube video, something to
[SPEAKER_02]: entertain yourself to listen to,
but nothing to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, we used to trim all
around the TV and we would watch YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: videos and trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that that is super distracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't watch videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will put their fucking scissors
down and you'll catch them just watching
[SPEAKER_02]: TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're paying people to trim,
don't have a TV in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcasts, maybe some standup comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to get everybody on the same
page when it comes to music, but maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: play some good music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some sort of stuff to make it
comfortable and help the time pass without
[SPEAKER_02]: your brain going crazy is what I'm getting
at, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got a clean space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a chair to sit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a good YouTube video on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a podcast going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're cozy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mind is entertained.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you need some gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some rubber gloves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to wear gloves when you're
trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get extremely sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to have to itch your face
and have to go wash your hands just to
[SPEAKER_02]: scratch your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your hands are going to be covered in
trichomes and resin, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you need some good scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the little tiny Fiskars diamond tip
scissors that you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're expensive at the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cheaper at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell them in the craft section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, the craft section at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all of Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell them in the fabric section over
by the fabric.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Fiskars diamond tip titanium
scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like those.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work really well for trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're super light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get something with a spring in it that
opens on its own because you don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be opening and closing scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want the kind of scissors that
have loops that go around your fingers
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're going to be cutting for so
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little loops around your fingers are
going to dig into you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want lightweight, super fast
trimming shears.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're easy to find and they're
affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe get yourselves two pair so that you
can set one in the rubbing alcohol to
[SPEAKER_02]: clean off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dirty up another pair,
swap them out real quick, not have to
[SPEAKER_02]: spend a lot of time cleaning your
scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need some good gloves, some good
scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you need some containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a container for untrimmed buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend a five-gallon bucket for the
untrimmed buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you don't have that much herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something smaller will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you need another container for
trimmed buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you need another container for
saveable trim and then we need another
[SPEAKER_02]: container for waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need trimmed buds, untrimmed buds,
usable trim and waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple other things I'm going to
recommend and you're going to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: why the hell would he recommend this for a
grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend either some coconut oil
or some baby oil for your trim session.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to say, why do we need that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is why.
[SPEAKER_02]: When your fingers and hands and arms get
all sticky, you can use the coconut oil or
[SPEAKER_02]: the baby oil to remove the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your hands are all covered in resin,
my thing is that my arms get covered in
[SPEAKER_02]: resin because I'm the one cutting down the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reaching in there and playing with
them and carrying them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: My arm hair and shit gets all coated in
trichomes and plant resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use the coconut oil or baby oil to
just rub up on my arms and rub that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: right off and all the resin comes right
off and then you're not all sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a basic breakdown of things that
you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_02]: For your trim session, you need a nice
clean space in which to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a nice cozy chair in which to
sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a good podcast to listen to,
probably the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you need some gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you need your containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you've got your cleanup supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about doing the manual
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully a few days before harvest,
you went in and did a pre-harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what I mean by that is while the
plants are still alive, while you're
[SPEAKER_02]: flushing, anywhere between, I don't know,
seven days before harvest up to the day of
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest, you can go in there and just
start pulling off all of the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are done growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just flushing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just finishing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichomes are ripening up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need all that excess leaf in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just go ahead and tear all that leaf
out of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a pre-harvest defoliation session
will save you a lot of time when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: time to trim because all of that long
straggly leaf is already gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even there to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already been removed and it will also
help your drying and curing time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go in and pull off all the big leaves
before you harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a highly detailed harvest
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't listened to that,
go listen to that, then come catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the harvest episode,
we're left with our plants hanging upside
[SPEAKER_02]: down in a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we want those plants to get to where
the sticks snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the sticks get snappy, you can start
trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also start trimming them after
they've been in their cure containers for
[SPEAKER_02]: a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like dry trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for the buds to be dry
enough to where the leaves kind of just
[SPEAKER_02]: flake right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still going to be moisture inside
those buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's moisture in the middle,
but the outside is dry enough to where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can just kind of knock the buds off,
the leaves off the buds with your thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making a little motion with my hands
that sort of looks like I'm playing a
[SPEAKER_02]: video game, like I've got a game
controller in my hand, but my hands are
[SPEAKER_02]: really close together.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, I'm just holding that little
bud with my forefingers, or maybe with my
[SPEAKER_02]: left hand, and I'm just knocking the
leaves off with my right hand,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like I'm just, it looks like I'm
playing a video game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just holding the bud and just rubbing
the leaves right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hold it with the bud facing up,
if you rub down, those leaves will just
[SPEAKER_02]: rub right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see what I'm talking about when you
figure out the technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go, man, that is so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My point is that I want it to where the
buds are dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to just knock those
leaves right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is how I actually do my trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I'm working with the plants,
I like to wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step one of trimming is put on some rubber
gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the six millimeter nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if they're black.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if they're blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just care that they fit and that they're
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glove up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get all sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I don't want to get my skin all over
the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step one is glove up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step two of trimming is to knock all of
the buds off of the sticks into a five
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go and get every bud off the sticks
into a bucket and then discard all the
[SPEAKER_02]: sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've compressed your work into a
much smaller space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks way less overwhelming and you can
see what you've got ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a five gallon bucket filled
with buds that you need to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look like this big sprawl of
branches and leaves and shit everywhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: just a bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way less intimidating and you can get
through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So knock all the buds into a bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can use just a small bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can use something smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how much you grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you need five buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you need 10 or 25 gallon buckets,
but find the container that's the right
[SPEAKER_02]: size for what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: A five gallon bucket from Home Depot or
Lowe's is really affordable and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: disposable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to use the buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knock every bud into a bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've got a five gallon bucket full of
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: My next step is just to reach in,
grab the bud off the top and start
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'll actually start talking about
trimming a little bit and the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming of the bud process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea is to knock or cut off all of the
excessive leaves and stems and give
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself a nice pretty presentable bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know what a good trimmed bud
looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they start off, they're covered in
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our job to knock those leaves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to smoke leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves contain chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves don't get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we want is a nice frosty green
nugget.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you guys get started trimming,
you'll see what's a leaf material and what
[SPEAKER_02]: is a usable bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start digging in there and just
start knocking off some of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll find that bud in the middle and it
will start to become very obvious what you
[SPEAKER_02]: do and do not trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your buds are kind of airy and fluffy,
don't trim too deeply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just knock off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to grab the bud by the base,
by that little stick at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bud and just use my thumb to push the
leaves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of spin the bud in a circle
with my left hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will turn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking that's counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that is clockwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it
comes toward me, I'll use my right thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using my left hand to spin the bud
toward me and as that one side comes
[SPEAKER_02]: toward me, my thumb just knocks the leaves
off right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wiping them off like I'm just
scraping the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so dry that they knock off on
their own and don't press so hard that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're fucking up the shape of the bud and
knocking off trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do this really gently.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find the technique after you do it
a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be really comfortable and you'll get
really fast at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people like to do this with
scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll hold it in their left hand and
they'll take their scissors and just turn
[SPEAKER_02]: it and trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves are sticking off horizontally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep your scissors horizontal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can adjust your angle as you need and
just spin that bud and keep cutting just
[SPEAKER_02]: like you're giving it a haircut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to take off those leaves and
leave that bud there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just knock off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't carve too deeply into the buds and
don't squish the buds while you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't squeeze them super hard and try not
to handle them too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little tiny bud doesn't need a lot of
handling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to get all those trichomes
on your gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to leave the trichomes on the
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use scissors if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my thumbs for most trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little edge of my thumb and my
thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer for
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've mastered that technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knock off the little leaves and cut the
big buds into smaller sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys can see a stick in there and
it's like one bud and then a little stick
[SPEAKER_02]: and another bud, take that shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to buy a stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Connoisseur quality bud is taken down to
the small part.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to leave your buds in big
buds, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't want to buy a big
stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have some customers that want big
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have people that just wanted big
buds and then some people know better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, man, I don't want to buy
that quarter, that one bud that weighs a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter because I know right up the middle
of it is a gram of stick and I'm getting
[SPEAKER_02]: ripped off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people want it, some people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've got it trimmed up to the size
you want it and the amount of trim you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, I cut off all the little leaves at
the bottom also.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people leave little cabbage-y
looking leaves at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut that shit off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it cabbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also take out the handlebar stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the bottom you're going to have the
branch that the bud was actually stuck to
[SPEAKER_02]: the branch to and then there's two little
sticks that come out that those first
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves were attached to and they're all
dry and shitty looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut those off of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a pound of weed and you've
got all those little tiny sticks in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: those little sticks make your pound look
like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take it out and your pound is going
to look so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be so much more desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get you more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim it and it's worth more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take off all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take off that little stick at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knock off all the crow's feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a little tiny pointy leaf
sticking out of somewhere, cut that out or
[SPEAKER_02]: knock it off with your thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little triangle leaves make you look
lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did a whole good job on most of the
bud and you just left one or two little
[SPEAKER_02]: triangles at the tip, you look lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm doing this, all the trimming
work, I trim over a tray or a container to
[SPEAKER_02]: catch what I trim off.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that little stuff that gets clipped
off is going to be used to make
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates or edibles in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gather all that stuff up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trim into the floor and then sweep
it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trim onto the table and then scoop
it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim onto a tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim into a container so that it is kept
clean so it's treated with respect because
[SPEAKER_02]: it may go into edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that you're going to eat need to be
treated with respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things you're going to smoke need to be
treated with respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gather this stuff up and vacuum seal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to keep the trim in a vacuum sealed
bag in the dark until I'm able to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that to your extractor as soon as you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sticks, those are thrown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throw all the sticks away.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a commercial grow, they're thrown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a home grow, those should go to the
compost pile or they could be burned or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sticks are trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to extract sticks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a waste of energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get anything out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you're adding the sticks to the
trim, you're just making the hash worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not making it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: What goes in comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just put shit in to make more,
you're going to get more, but it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gather up all your trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vacuum seal the trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the trim in a dark place and get that
to somebody that can turn that into
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you've got yellow or brown or
funky leaves that are falling off as
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trimming, separate those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull those out of the trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't send that to the extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to make your hash dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make your hash taste like
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make it less potent and it's
going to make it less desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a little work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out of there and you will have a
better product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use your thumbs or some scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: To gently remove the excess leaves and the
little stems from the buds, get rid of the
[SPEAKER_02]: handlebars, get rid of the crow's feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the buds are trimmed to your
satisfaction, you can place them into a
[SPEAKER_02]: container for finished products.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say to your satisfaction,
how you want to trim your buds is up to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to leave it a little fluffy,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to trim it nice and tight,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your product is for you personally,
then you can leave it as leafy as you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can knock those leaves off right
before you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can clean it up yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you plan on getting top dollar for your
product, you'll need to have a tight,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean trim job.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I should mention that will help
us speed up the process of trimming is the
[SPEAKER_02]: rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the bud you are trimming is not bigger
than the tip of your thumb, it's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: better to let that bud go to your hash
pile and trim something more substantial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put those little popcorn buds in the hash
pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it in your trim pile and you can make
better hash that will improve the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a little tiny bud, don't waste
time trimming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just throw it in the hash pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't waste your time trimming little tiny
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like that little tiny bud is
worth less money than the time it is
[SPEAKER_02]: taking you to trim it, set it aside and
put it in the hash pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to trim that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If herb costs $10 a gram and it takes you
a minute to trim that little nug,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toss that little nug into the trim bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll add that to the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab something that we can trim and get on
the shelf and make it purchasable for the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's real tiny, if it's ugly,
don't bother trimming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put that in your hash pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add that to the to be extracted
pile and that will just improve your
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will also speed you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if you need every little half
gram, every piece of gravel out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: crop to make your goal, to make your
weight, go ahead and trim that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be weight in the bottom of the
bag, but if it's not necessary,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's just for you, put that in the
concentrate pile and speed yourself up.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a commercial grow, the growers are
expected to kick out a pound minimum per
[SPEAKER_02]: person per shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people turn in two pounds every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they spend time trimming that
little gravel shit, they would never get
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a way of separating all those
little tiny buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that little stuff gets filtered out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets pushed to the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of that, those little buds
and the trim, they're combined and it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: turned into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do a nice tight trim if you want to
sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't go overboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trim it too tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also don't try trimming all those
little buds or you're going to put
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself in debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to pay your trimmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're spending your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it cost effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now something I want to mention,
trimming will be very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some buds are tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some buds are real fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some buds are little compacted little
rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just kind of rub your fingers over
those and those are going to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some buds are airy and have a lot of
texture to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are going to be a little harder to
trim because you don't want to knock off
[SPEAKER_02]: all those calyxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you're working for somebody else,
you're going to have to adjust to how they
[SPEAKER_02]: want it trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go to a grow, and you're working
for someone else, they get to dictate how
[SPEAKER_02]: tight your trim is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't over trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't under trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: You trim to their expectation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not sure what they want,
have them trim up a bud and show you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have them trim up two or three buds and
set those at your workstation so you have
[SPEAKER_02]: something to refer to as the day goes on
so that you don't forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also if they come by and say,
hey, why are you doing it like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a couple little buds to show them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could say, hey, these are what you
showed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me where I'm going wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they can say, fuck, you're doing it
just like I showed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a nice tight trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're setting the trim in one pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're setting our little tiny buds in
another pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're mixing that up so we can make good
concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are getting rid of all the sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I think we have covered most of
trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: One great thing about trimming is scissor
and glove hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that sticky shit that builds up on
your gloves and scissors is smokable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke that right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike loves scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I like to do if I've been trimming,
so say you've been trimming, you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: this weird layer of sticky, gooey-looking
shit all over your gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub your hands together and you'll start
figuring out how to rub your hands in a
[SPEAKER_02]: circle to make that stuff stick together.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of heat goes a long way,
so if your hands get warm, it'll start
[SPEAKER_02]: taking that resin right off of your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to smoke it off your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, we used to call it finger
hash, but please wear gloves now and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to call it glove hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can scrape it off your scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke it off your gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then put it in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it on top of some pot or just
put it in an empty bowl and just put a
[SPEAKER_02]: flame to it and melt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just slowly melt that shit until it starts
smoking and you can smoke that scissor
[SPEAKER_02]: hash, that glove hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke it right away, but please
don't pass that shit to me if you did that
[SPEAKER_02]: off your skin and weren't wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to smoke your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one good thing about trimming is
you get scissor hash right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that anything that sticks to your
gloves, that's yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you come trim for me and that shit
sticks to your gloves, I have no problem
[SPEAKER_02]: with you rolling that right off your
glove.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that in a pipe and smoke it right in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You earned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is your scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you're trimming your ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's on your scissors, scrape your
scissors off, smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a lot of people will do, all the
trimmers in the room will just gather all
[SPEAKER_02]: their scissor hash into one pile and put
it into a big ball and then at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day, you guys all smoke that together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a little celebration,
but it's smokable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make edibles out of it if you want
to, but I would recommend smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike loves smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not my favorite to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little, it's heavy on the lungs and
it tastes kind of wet, but it is potent
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will give you a big fat hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another great thing about dry trimming
that I didn't mention of your container
[SPEAKER_02]: and now you know how much product is on
the scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always rewarding knowing how much
product you've got right at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: trim process.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you wet trim, you don't know because
you've got to wait for it to dry still.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people say, how much did you trim
today?
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, I trimmed a wet pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out in a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're paying people to trim by the
pound, dry trim is the way to go because
[SPEAKER_02]: now you've got dry pounds to weigh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a wet pound to guess on the
weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one more thing I should definitely
mention to all of my friends who have
[SPEAKER_02]: never trimmed before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody who is new with cannabis,
here's something that I have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you are trimming or working with
plants in general, do not touch your eyes
[SPEAKER_02]: with sticky trim fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't rub your eye with the back of your
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go wash your hands before you touch your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you rub your eyes with trichomes or
plant resin on your finger, it is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: burn for the next hour and it is sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you blink, most of the time you
think you can blink and it'll fix your
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky eye or whatever's in your eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not when you have resin in your eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you blink, it gets fucking
stickier and it feels like your eyelid is
[SPEAKER_02]: sticking to your eyeball and it just
burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, wear gloves and if you need to itch
your eye, take your fucking glove off your
[SPEAKER_02]: hand, then itch your eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would almost consider washing my hands
before the itch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the glove off, go wash the hand,
then scratch the eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand sometimes you just got to
stick your finger in your eye because
[SPEAKER_02]: shit's going weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that glove off, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put plant resin or trichomes in your
eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will fucking suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the technical term.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no other way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fucking sucks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I feel like I've given you a pretty
good lesson on trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I didn't teach you exactly how to
trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: The act of holding the bud and putting the
scissors to it is something you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have to experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will develop your technique and your
style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've given you a pretty good
outline.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what to do with the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to get it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need some practice doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some buds and put some scissors to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way you're going to get
good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only way you're going to get
faster at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we hire new trimmers at The Grow,
we don't always hire the people that claim
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the fastest trimmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hire the people that interview well and
seem like they're going to fit in with the
[SPEAKER_02]: crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they say they can only trim a half a
pound of weed when they start,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is fine if that is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they say they can trim a half a pound
and they only do a quarter pound,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I've got issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they say, I can trim a half a pound in
a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will train them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will teach them our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll teach them some tricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get a rhythm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get a routine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, they'll be trimming a
pound and a half a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all about just finding the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about finding the groove.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes you a little bit of time and
experience to get in there and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, these are buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are precious to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in this industry for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can grab a flowering plant that's a few
days in and just cut that fucker down and
[SPEAKER_02]: feel no remorse or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what needed to happen in a
commercial grow, I kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people treat little buds like
they're the most precious thing they've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever seen, which I respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to grow a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have produced over a ton of cannabis in
my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am responsible for a ton of cannabis
having been produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't have that under
their belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every bud is precious to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to fuck up one single bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they're new at it, they go really
slow, especially a higher trimmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is your bud that they're playing
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect them for taking their time and
going slow with it, but also encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: them to go faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to learn and go faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people like to go slow in the
beginning because they're playing with
[SPEAKER_02]: gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're playing with little pieces of
gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got little babies in their hand
and they're new, so they're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: intimidated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get faster as time goes on is what
I'm trying to say, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need some practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll become a good trimmer if you want
to become a good trimmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to get your foot in the
door in the commercial marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: being a trimmer is probably the number one
way to get in the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trimmers and bud tenders are how you get
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trimming can be really time consuming
and tedious, but it is the last step
[SPEAKER_02]: before you claim victory in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your garden is for sale, you're one
step ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're one step away from money.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your garden is for medicinal uses,
you're one step away from feeling better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trimming sucks, but you're almost
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the hardest, most time consuming,
tedious part in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my least favorite part, but it is
one step away from sweet success.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, podcast ruled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope this trimming lesson made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the only way to get good at
trimming is to get sticky and get some
[SPEAKER_02]: practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there, get your gloves dirty,
get your scissors all sticky and start
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming up some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to learn and you've got
friends that are harvesting, volunteer to
[SPEAKER_02]: trim for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody could use a free trimmer and we
know we're going to have to teach you
[SPEAKER_02]: that's fine, but we hope that in a few
harvests, you're going to show up and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to trim your ass off like a
savage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are people that will help you
learn by letting you trim for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get those opportunities,
please do take them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure I left
something out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I missed something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I sparked any questions with this
episode, I invite you to email me all of
[SPEAKER_02]: your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear what I skipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear what I left out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you've got some other random
questions, I will answer those also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, it's
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening
to the trimming episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the part where I pitch my Patreon
campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would truly appreciate your support on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
couple of bucks and you were able to
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute financially, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's P-A-T-R.

[SPEAKER_02]: If you contribute to the podcast,
I will use those contributions to pay for
[SPEAKER_02]: the website that keeps the podcast free
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will also use those contributions to
pay for the upgraded MacBook I bought so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can keep the podcast coming and
keep the videos coming to everybody for
[SPEAKER_02]: free.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I will never charge you for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I am able to put this podcast
out for free, it will be free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be free for you as well.

format always will be free.
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes, Stitcher, and the YouTube channel,
as it is, will always be free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do this because I love cannabis and I
love you, and I want you to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: medicate and recreate the best ways
possible with the highest quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: cleanest, safest products available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the only way you can do that
is by growing it yourself.

that you don't have to rely on anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else.

[SPEAKER_02]: It's become a tradition that we start the
podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I'm taking dabs of vanilla cookies
batter from Apothecary Farms, and it
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you let the nail cool nice and cool,
you get the real nice vanilla cream kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a savage and you hit it while
the nail's a little bit hot, you get that
[SPEAKER_02]: spicy Durban poison part of the Girl Scout
Cookies flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really love both flavors,
and it really gives me a great buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really enjoy the vanilla cookies from
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to everybody at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to all three locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a Pueblo location.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a Colorado Springs location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time this comes out,
they will have opened a Denver location.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big up and congratulations to all of my
friends at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
another repost episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_02]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the timeline of those grow lessons,
it has become time to clean up and reset
[SPEAKER_02]: our garden for the next run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I originally did this episode as number
327.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reposting it now as 392.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's clean up and reset our garden
[SPEAKER_02]: for the next run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode of the podcast is brought to

[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bong, or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_02]: dab rig, because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode 328 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I like to start the show off by
letting you know what, I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I'm smoking Stardog Ambrosia Batter
from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know me, you know I love the
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the aroma, I love the flavor,
I love the high, I love the way it grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course, I love taking pictures of
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a very photogenic strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, I'm taking pictures of Stardog
Ambrosia Batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_02]: Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you've been following the show
lately, you've probably caught the
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes about determining ripeness of
your cannabis plants, then we did an
[SPEAKER_02]: episode about flushing your plants,
then we did an episode about harvesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: then we did an episode about drying and
curing your cannabis plants, then we did
[SPEAKER_02]: an episode about trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it is time to clean up the grow room
and get restarted for the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about after
harvest cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds pretty basic, but there are a
few things you may overlook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you had bugs or powdery mildew,
you may want to step up your cleaning
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may want to step up your cleaning
regimen, but if you didn't have any bugs
[SPEAKER_02]: or any issues, I think a light bleach and
water solution should work, or maybe you
[SPEAKER_02]: might want to get yourself some Fizan and
use 15 to 20 mils of Fizan per gallon of
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that to clean up your whole grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, whatever product you use,
let's clean everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipe down every inch of every wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start at one section at the top and just
work your way down and to the right,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then just keep going until you've
covered every inch of that grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you can reach, scrub the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't reach, find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can probably reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, get a ladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrub the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's clean it with either bleach and hot
water or Fizan and hot water and just get
[SPEAKER_02]: anything off of there that may be hiding
that we don't want in that grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you've got a spider mite up there
chilling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you've got a little bit of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a spore that you don't know
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a piece of pollen up there
that you don't know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's clean everything just to be sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean your light reflectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The top of the lights, they're probably
dusty up on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reflectors, they're dusty on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take this opportunity while the room's
empty and clean everything, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the light reflectors down if you
think they need some cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang them back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean your fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the fans off of the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the little grate off the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unscrew the little thing that holds the
blades on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the blades off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the blades.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fans get disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grate on the back is filled with muck
and hair and just weird random gunk that I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't even tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that shit out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably going to be disgusted that
you've been blowing that shit around in
[SPEAKER_02]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean your fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're cleaning the fans,
look at anything that moves air or blows
[SPEAKER_02]: air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the air return.
[SPEAKER_02]: On your dehumidifier, that thing's pulling
in a bunch of water and a bunch of air and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's blowing air back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that filter need to be changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that dehumidifier need to be cleaned
off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the water line that's draining water
out of your dehumidifier, is it gunky?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it need to be cleaned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the reservoir that you're draining your
dehumidifier water into starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: develop slime and algae?
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, you need to clean that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay on top of those sort of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean your dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dust everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The top of everything is dusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: The top of everything is funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been spraying pesticides in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine you sprayed some sticky pesticide
like Asimax in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it got dusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just sticking to the Asimax.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipe it and dust the tops of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean your hydro tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got tables in the room,
clean them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got trays and you can take them
outside, take them outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray them down with the hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a power washer, hit them
with the power washer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If those tables are real dirty,
scrub them down with some Fizan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrub them down with some bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you rinse them out real good and
just get them real clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, the Fizan is going to foam up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make foam with Fizan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure you clean everything out
when you're done using cleaning products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean out your tables and reservoirs
really well if you use a cleaning product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But rinse the shit out of those hydro
tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rinse the shit out of all your tubing and
all of your lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that stuff so that it's not clogged
and so there's no algae in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something people don't pay enough
attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just walk on the floor all day,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got some sort of poly film or
panda film on the floor, some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: subfloor, does it need to be replaced?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there holes in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has your poly or your panda film started
stretching and getting holes from the
[SPEAKER_02]: staples?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need to duct tape some spots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that kind of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean your floors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything lands on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The floor is gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, here's something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got light reflectors with glass
on them so that they're air-cooled,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean that glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that glass out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipe that shit down with some Windex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it dry and put it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the reflector glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, clean all of your air conditioner
filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure they are clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got ducting anywhere,
check your ducting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the ducting isn't bent in any
weird places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure there are no clogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure all of your duct is secured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it's duct taped or clamped
somewhere so that the air you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: move away from the grow doesn't
accidentally end up being blown right
[SPEAKER_02]: where you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a leak, that air is just
going to come flying out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may just be moving the heat from the
light right back into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then your air conditioner has to work
harder and you can't figure out why the
[SPEAKER_02]: room isn't cooling down and it gets
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check all of your ducting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that carbon filter still filtering?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you smell the herb outside when you
grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did anybody mention that your harvest
stunk really badly?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you had that carbon filter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you write it down?
[SPEAKER_02]: You should know when that carbon filter
needs to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the brands say they will last two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never believe in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had a carbon filter last two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, that carbon filter cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're going to leave that filter
there for two years and it's got that
[SPEAKER_02]: little dust cover on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that ugly thing off, throw it in the
washer with some OxyClean and clean that
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to see your pictures of your
black and gray carbon filter dust cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you guys, get in there and clean out
the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a reservoir that you mix
your nutrients in or that you use as part
[SPEAKER_02]: of your hydro system that you're pumping
your nutrients from right to your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean that reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't you want to clean fresh
start?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want biofilm and funk in there
because that's going directly to your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, clean all of the tubing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already said that once, but clean it
all because all that gunk will end up into
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing we should remember to clean
is the emitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a hydro system with some
sprayers, or emitters, or sprinklers at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of a line, make sure you pop those
emitters off and clean them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to get filled with some gunky
funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the perfect opportunity to take all
those off and clean them up real well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another really important thing we can do
while we've got the room taken down,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can decide if we need to replace any
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have your bulbs been in the grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on what type of lighting you're
using, it may be time to swap out some
[SPEAKER_02]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: When bulbs get old, they still draw the
same amount of electricity but they do not
[SPEAKER_02]: put out the same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're paying for that electricity and
it is not making it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check your bulbs and see if they need
to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good way to find out if they need to be
replaced is to get a lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lumen meter will measure how much light
is coming from your bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your bulb is putting out less than 75
or 80% of its maximum output, it is time
[SPEAKER_02]: to replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now how do you know what the maximum
output of that bulb is?
[SPEAKER_02]: The way to find that out is to buy a brand
new bulb put the bulb in your reflector
[SPEAKER_02]: and turn it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you've got to wait a few minutes and
let that bulb get to its maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: brightness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a little while for the bulbs to
heat up and get to the right spectrum and
[SPEAKER_02]: get all the way bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's bright and all the way heated
up, go about 12 to 18 inches from that
[SPEAKER_02]: bulb and measure what the lumens are right
there and write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write down the date and the amount of
lumens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then check it now when you're cleaning the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go the same distance away with that lumen
meter and see how many lumens are popping
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not satisfied with the amount of
power you're getting out of that bulb,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is time to replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like you're paying for
electricity that is not making it to your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, it is time to replace your bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lumen meters may be expensive,
but a lot of times the grow shop will let
[SPEAKER_02]: you borrow one because they know that if
your bulbs are bad, you're probably just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to come buy more bulbs when you
return the lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ask them at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may have one available that you can
borrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right guys, most of the cleaning stuff
should be fairly obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the shit out of everything,
scrub everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to put plants in anything
that had a cleaner in it, make sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: get that cleaner out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Replace the bulbs, replace the filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other things we may not remember to
think about are check and reset your
[SPEAKER_02]: timers and all of your programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got your lights on a certain
schedule, fix that schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got your CO2 or your auto
watering on a schedule, make sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: correct that schedule before you put new
plants in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did daylight savings time happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the timer on the right time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is your timer on the right day?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the controllers have a day that
you can set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the proper day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have AM and PM set properly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check out all of your
controllers before you put plants in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and you accidentally flower them way too
early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, check out all of your CO2 controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I like to do at this point
in time is calibrate all of my pins and
[SPEAKER_02]: meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to calibrate my pH pin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to make sure that my EC meter is
working properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all things that you should check
on between harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to calibrate my meters about once
every two weeks to tell you the truth,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably every 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like to check on them and make sure
that those things are accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, you should have a fire
extinguisher near your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the little gauge on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it's in the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your fire extinguisher gauge is not in
the green, either buy a new one or take it
[SPEAKER_02]: to the fire department and have it
refilled correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope you don't have to use that
fire extinguisher, but if you need it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want it to work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, check the batteries and your smoke
alarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I said smoke alarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your grow should have a smoke alarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to burn down the house
because something went wrong in the grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room and you did not have a smoke detector
and a fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be a responsible grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that the safety precautions are
in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, since we're checking on the fire
extinguisher and the smoke alarm,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is a good time to check on your
respirator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you using a respirator to apply
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope you're using something to
keep the fire extinguisher going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to save your life over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's a good time to replace your
gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need more nitrile gloves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need more Tyvek suits?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is a really good time to make a list
and go to the grow store and stock up on
[SPEAKER_02]: those types of items.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the grow room nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've checked all of our safety
precautions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've refilled all of the necessary
supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is a good time to do a quick inventory
of your pesticides and nutrients and any
[SPEAKER_02]: accessories you think you may need if
you're going to need pesticides or
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start ordering that stuff now so that when
you move your plants back into the room,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have got all of the nutrients and all
of the supplies you need so that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: miss a day of the grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got everything cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've checked out all of our safety
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've restocked all of our personal
protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've reordered all of our nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we didn't have any problems with
pests or powdery mildew, it is time to
[SPEAKER_02]: start running that room and get it
prepared for the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you did have pests or problems,
there are a couple of more steps that we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to clean this room thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to spray it with some products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might want to go a little harder with
the bleach water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might want to go a little harder with
some Fizan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to get a product called
Procure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had powdery mildew, you're going to
want to spray something to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_02]: spores in that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had bugs, I would recommend
spraying some sort of pesticide through
[SPEAKER_02]: the entire room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just mix up your pesticide sprayer,
your pump sprayer, if you don't have one,
[SPEAKER_02]: go get one from Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a deck sprayer that can handle bleach
because you're going to be putting some
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need one that holds about a
gallon, maybe two gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill it up with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your cleaning product in there,
whether it's Fizan, whether it's Procure,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's a bunch of bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you want to use granulated sulfur if
you had a PM issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray the shit out of the entire room.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your best opportunity to spray
everything and eliminate your problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no plants in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use products that you wouldn't
spray when you've got plants in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there and clean the shit out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would start with the normal cleaning I
recommended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take everything down and clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then put it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then set up the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you put the plants in there,
go in there with this extra hard commando
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go really hard, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get all of the bugs out of
there or you're just going to bring plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in there and they're going to get bugs or
they're going to get PM and you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have another struggling hard harvest
and nobody likes to struggle through a
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've taken everything apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've cleaned the shit out of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've replaced the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've replaced all of our filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have calibrated all of our equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got new protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have tested our safety equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've put the room back together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone in there and done another final
spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we hit it with Fizan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we sprayed Procure on everything to
try to get rid of our problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we just sprayed bleach water,
real hot bleach water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we went in there with some H2O2.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would work really well also.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you use any type of products like
that, you guys make sure you wear personal
[SPEAKER_02]: protective equipment, some goggles and a
respirator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to spray bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to spray H2O2.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to spray Fizan without some
sort of protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit will be terrible for your eyes,
terrible for your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're using a sprayer to spray
anything, please use some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: respiratory protection, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now once the room is put back together,
here is something I suggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would turn on the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would turn on your blowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would turn on the fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would turn on the air conditioner and I
would let everything run for a few minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would stand in the room and pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you could dial in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you could adjust?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it while you're in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then go outside and walk around your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your grow is at your house,
just go walk around the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go pick up trash around the house or
whatever and see if you can identify any
[SPEAKER_02]: light leaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see light coming out of your grow
room?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see light coming out, there is
light going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not want and cannot have light leaks
in our grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So walk around the house, walk around the
perimeter, identify any possible light
[SPEAKER_02]: leaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you hear the blowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you hear the fans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you hear your air conditioner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anything outside making it obvious that
you're running a grow in that house?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good time to discover that we've
got light leaks or that we've got noisy
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment so that we don't get ourselves
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not want to attract law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be legal where you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is legal where I grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am still stealth because you know who's
worse than law enforcement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking thieves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want people to know you've got
to grow in your house because somebody may
[SPEAKER_02]: come and take your crop from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be careful even in a legal
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your grow stealth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So walk around outside, look, listen,
smell, pay attention, see if anything is
[SPEAKER_02]: going wrong outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you're sure that everything is fine
outside, that's when you can go back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow room, turn off the lights in the
grow room, and stand in there for about 10
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let your eyes adjust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time to find out if any light
is leaking into the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time to find out if the
sunshine from outside is coming through
[SPEAKER_02]: your ducts for your vanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light hoods right into your light
reflectors into your grow room and shining
[SPEAKER_02]: light on your plants during a dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time to find that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the catch to these last two things,
you're only going to be able to tell if
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a light leak outside if you go
walk around the house and it's dark
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way you can tell if you have a
light leak inside is if it's light outside
[SPEAKER_02]: and you go in the grow room and you turn
off the lights on the inside of the grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have to find the time
of day to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to do some
investigating and some inspecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are very important details to
not overlook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure your grow room is lightproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure there's not a lot of noise
coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also find out if you've got too much
aroma and correct it if you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to attract attention that
you don't need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've been growing for a while,
or if you're somebody who is looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: grows, so say myself, I've been growing
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I used to go walk my dog in my
neighborhood, I would always discover a
[SPEAKER_02]: new grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go a different route.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go two blocks that way, three blocks
that way, a block that way, and then I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: come back and then the next day I'd just
do a different pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would always find a new grow about once
a week because I know what I'm looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for, listening for and smelling for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the details.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the clues.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I hear your weird blower at three in
the morning going from your basement
[SPEAKER_02]: window, chances are you got to grow in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got an air conditioner in your
basement window in the middle of winter,
[SPEAKER_02]: chances are there's a grow in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got one window by the basement
that has no snow and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard is snow, there's a grow in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's one spot on your roof above one
bedroom that there's no snow on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a grow in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are really easy signs that give it
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention, you guys, because if I can
see it, law enforcement can see it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so can the thieves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful with your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to stay stealth, even in legal states.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to brag.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to set bait.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that is a pretty good clean
and reset episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, I mentioned some details that
you would have overlooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, I rescued you through a couple
of pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you don't have to make those
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, everything was well in your
grow and you don't have any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, you don't have anything funky
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, now that the grow is nice and clean,
let's fucking keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get in there with a mop and a broom
every day if we need to, and mop and sweep
[SPEAKER_02]: that bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get in there with a shop vac and
suck out that shit in the corner you've
[SPEAKER_02]: been looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the fucking shop vac and back that
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to shop vac itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great place for a spider mite to
hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great place for some aphids to
hang out and breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great place for some powdery
mildew to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just a vector for problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you've got it nice and clean,
don't be lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there and clean it as often as you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say that cleanliness is godliness,
and I think that most applies in kitchens
[SPEAKER_02]: and grow rooms, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean up that grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give yourself a nice, clean environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give your plants a nice, healthy start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think your plants will be more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you will also notice working
in a cleaner, more organized environment
[SPEAKER_02]: will make you happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make you faster and more productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shit, now that you're done cleaning up
the grow room, why don't you clean up all
[SPEAKER_02]: your supplies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go organize your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go organize the pesticides, the measuring
devices, your cleaning supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go write down a list of anything that you
can need, anything that you're low on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get yourself organized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, get a notebook and start making
detailed notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start documenting when you changed your
bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start documenting when you changed your
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start documenting the last time you
changed your air conditioner filters and
[SPEAKER_02]: calibrated your meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start writing that stuff down so that when
something comes up, you can look in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and go, oh, that's why my pH meter isn't
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't calibrated the fucking thing in
two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may find some things you were slipping
on if you start taking more notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, podcast ruled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that pretty much wraps up my
clean and reset the grow room episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out with me for another
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part of the podcast where I
remind
[SPEAKER_02]: you to subscribe to my channel.

[SPEAKER_01]: This is Doug Benson and you're listening
to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for episode 395 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode is brought to you by Organ
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, Organ Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend Organ Elite Seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can find them at www.organeliteseeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I've been taking dads of gelato
cake batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from our friends at a apothecary
farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: The label says it is 62.2% THC and 73.4%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a really unique, funky aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find the right words to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is gross, it is funky, and it is sweet,
spicy, and sour, and delicious all at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really can't get enough of the gelato
cake batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The aroma is remarkable, the flavor is
incredible, and the buzz is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got me nice and high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got my eyes kind of droopy,
and I've got the best cotton mouth right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to all my friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great gelato cake
batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, podcast world, if you've been
following along, you know that I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a previous episode, I mentioned that
those lessons were over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since that time, I realized I left out a
very crucial part of our grow experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started off by making a solid plan for
our grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought out our equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought out our space very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought out our genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we successfully ran a full
garden cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have dried and cured that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some beautifully trimmed up
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the one thing I left out?
[SPEAKER_02]: We never smoked this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this episode is going to be the smoke
that shit episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've ran a full garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's reward ourselves and enjoy our
finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really nothing like smoking your
own product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any flowers that you've grown,
harvested, trimmed, you spend a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: time with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've really got some attachment to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really a rewarding feeling that
comes with smoking a crop that you grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown many, many small personal
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have grown many large commercial crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done a lot of pheno hunts of plants
that I have bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have grown a lot of plants and it is
still very exciting to me to get to try
[SPEAKER_02]: the first little batch of smoke from each
crop that I grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something very rewarding and very
satisfying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like a kid inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a kid on Christmas morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to try my new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent all this time with it and I
finally get to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I do it, especially something
that I've just bred and it's his first run
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bred something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I phenohunted those seeds and now I
finally have a finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is real satisfaction to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing like that feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this may be your first time getting to
enjoy this experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want this to be a great experience for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want every harvest to be a wonderful
experience for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one thing that can really ruin
your experience when it comes to testing
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabis for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that can really fuck it up
is by being impatient.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cut down your plants too early,
they aren't going to be the quality you
[SPEAKER_02]: deserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you dried and cured your plants in a
rushing manner, you are not going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality that you deserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure those plants got to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure your plants were flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure they were harvested,
dried and cured and trimmed correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not try to smoke our first crop too
early and put a bad taste in our mouth
[SPEAKER_02]: literally about our new crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to take a bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to dry it fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to try to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to taste like shit and you're
going to feel like shit about your whole
[SPEAKER_02]: crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have just a bad feeling
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You spent all this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let each bud be ready before you smoke
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing we need to test before
we get down to smoking this product is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it dry enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you dried and cured this product
properly before we go putting it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: grinder and try to roll it up or put it in
a pipe?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is acceptable for a cured herb to be
kind of sticky and a little bit moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the way a lot of people like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get a lot of that in the
Colorado area because we have what is
[SPEAKER_02]: known as the Colorado crunch here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do plan to do a podcast all about
the Colorado crunch in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about your dried and cured herb
before we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a little spongy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a little sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have cured it properly,
that is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need to take a couple of nugs out
of the jar and set them on the table for
[SPEAKER_02]: three, four, maybe five or six hours
before you decide to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not uncommon to see a connoisseur
smoker pull out his jar of nugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: crack the lid, take out three or four
nuggets, set them on the table,
[SPEAKER_02]: seal the jar up, put it back in his little
stash spot, and then leave those nuggets
[SPEAKER_02]: on the table throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we smoke on as the day
goes by.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be a little bit damp as soon as
we pull them out of the jar, but as the
[SPEAKER_02]: day goes on, they're going to dry out
perfectly to roll a fat joint and pack a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure your herb is cured and dry
enough to burn properly so you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: disappoint yourself with your first
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're confident that your buds
are dried and cured and ready for
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption, let's talk about taking that
first taste test of our new crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, testing a new product is sort of a
combination between a science experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: and a ritual.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to be in my environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to use my equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to take away variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way, I can see what the actual
product is telling me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know that may sound weird to some
people, but a lot of stoners are very
[SPEAKER_02]: ritualistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by ritualistic, I don't mean some
fancy ceremony.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mean I like to be in a certain
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to be right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my comfortable smoking place.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you gave me a new concentrate,
if you gave me some flour, and you said,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, I want you to judge this or rate
this, this would be the best place for me
[SPEAKER_02]: to conduct that experiment so that I could
give you a proper review.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I'm comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the door is locked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I can consume safely here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that nobody can bother me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can control the environment here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can control the music here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great place for myself to
consume any type of cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couch over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bed about 50 feet away.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's snacks in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm set up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I've got my little chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my drinks right here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the computer so I could browse the
internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my next step in this talk is my
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all my favorite smoking equipment
just to the right of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite pipe is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite dab rig is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All my tools to keep those things in
proper smoking condition are all right
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of the ritual is being in the
right place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've probably got that little place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your little chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that little spot on your bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got that one little cozy spot
where they want to chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get in your little cozy place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get comfy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put on the music that you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the air the way you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be in your right place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, get your favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you've got that favorite bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you've got that favorite dab rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you've got that favorite pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find your favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be in your comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, maybe there are certain people you
do or don't like to smoke around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to smoke your crop for the
first time by yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you want to make it fun and bring
your friends along and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro, check out what I smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try it together for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always fun to have your friends
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, that puts you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you smoke it and it tastes like you
just stuck your tongue in a light socket
[SPEAKER_02]: and everyone's going to get to smoke that
with you and experience it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and share it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what everybody thinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk more about that
reaction in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that is really fun to
involve your friends in is if you do a
[SPEAKER_02]: phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you grew five seeds, you've probably
got five different phenotypes or maybe two
[SPEAKER_02]: or three different phenotypes to select
from out of those five.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always fun to load up five bowls or
roll five joints and label them somehow
[SPEAKER_02]: right on the end of the filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write number one, number two, or just
remember, and then smoke them with your
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and see if you guys like plant
number one, plant number two, plant number
[SPEAKER_02]: three better.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if different people in the room like
number one or number three better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe everybody in the room says,
bro, number five was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always fun to bring your friends
around to consume with you to see what you
[SPEAKER_02]: have just done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you want your first try your ritual?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want that to happen with friends
around or do you want that to be a little
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go both ways in my little comfort
zone right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two chairs right in front of me
where Mike is always invited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin likes to take this spot right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several other folks that come
over and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always invited.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always fun to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple other chairs we can pull
out if it gets crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to smoke with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you want to smoke your
first crop with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be timid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may not be your thing, but think
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want some friends around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I recommend when you come to
sampling your new product is make it your
[SPEAKER_02]: first smoke of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't smoke anything before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't eat any edibles before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in totally sober.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in fresh so that you know exactly what
your product has done to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me back up a couple of steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start off by grinding up our
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you are in your comfortable spot with
your people, with your music plan,
[SPEAKER_02]: with a drink on hand, you're ready to
rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first couple of things to consuming
your new flowers are a visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look and see what we've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's enjoy the beauty of this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: What colors do you see?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you trim it well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you trim it better next time by
looking at it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do the trichomes look?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that plant real frosty?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just kinda frosty?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a nice look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold it up to your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put a lot of work into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the next step is to give it a
little bit of a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you may break it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to put this in a grinder and
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can destroy this bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd give it a little squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: How moist is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's ready to smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you gonna embarrass yourself by trying
to put that in the pipe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really need just another day or two
of curing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does it need to sit on the table for a
couple hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your last chance before you grind
it up in front of your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it feel in your hand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it real sticky?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you've played with it a little
bit, smell the inside of the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that smell?
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to absorb and enjoy all of this stuff,
especially if it's your first crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this is like your thousandth crop,
slow down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop and smell the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the most rewarding parts of
the entire process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's enjoy this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not think too much about how much
did we harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it weigh?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it worth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's enjoy the actual flowers that we
have grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's enjoy the effort we made that turned
into a consumable product that is
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has a great aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a work of art and nature and
science all put together that you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Break it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it is time to put it in a grinder.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put it in the grinder and give it
a couple of turns, if that grinder is
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard to spin, your buds may be too
wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you open up that grinder,
if it's a little moist in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll be able to tell at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that one bud is a little bit too wet,
you still need to let the rest of the buds
[SPEAKER_02]: dry and cure just a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dry them a little bit more and you
will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you feel like the bud that you
have ground up is ready to consume,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's talk about consuming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you want to smoke it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your favorite way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke earlier about your favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to roll a joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a joint kind of a person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a bong kind of a person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a pipe kind of a person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to throw up the vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you want to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please, you could do it however
you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But please, for me, don't wrap it up in a
blunt wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just spent so much time growing the
most delicious herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You dried it and cured it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you going to wrap it up in a paper
bag?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am all about smoking a fat joint,
but I do not appreciate smoking a blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to roll it up,
get yourself some good papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get something like some raws, some
elements, something quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But please, for this first test,
please don't roll it up in a blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're on this subject,
if you're going to pack a bowl,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean your pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got some fresh herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your friends over.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to impress yourself and your
friends the best you can with this new
[SPEAKER_02]: herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clean your pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're smoking through the bong,
dude, clean the bong and change the bong
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't believe how many places I go
to smoke a bong load and the water looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like muck and I will not smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just change the bong water,
clean your piece, and everybody will enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: it much more and it will make your product
taste much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to impress everybody,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do the best we can to make your
product taste the best that it can.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you ground up your herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a fat joint rolled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a bong load packed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a pipe loaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you filled up the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you've got a volcano bag going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: However you decided to do it, now it is
time to take our first puff of our freshly
[SPEAKER_02]: dried and cured cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said earlier, I recommend this
being your first puff of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you know exactly what your herb
does to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have now come to my favorite part of
the entire process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now time to smoke the first sample
of our new herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you rolled up a joint, now's the
time to spark it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you packed up a bowl, now's the time to
start taking a couple of puffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got the vaporizer going,
now's the time to start taking a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: pools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a couple of pools, a couple of draws,
a couple of tokes off your new product and
[SPEAKER_02]: sit back for a couple of seconds and let
it sit in and see what it does to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much you consume,
but depending on your consumption level,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should probably be able to take two,
three, maybe four good draws or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're smoking a joint, maybe two or
three good draws.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're smoking a bowl, maybe two or
three, maybe three or four good puffs off
[SPEAKER_02]: of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're hitting the bong, hopefully you
only need one or two good bong rips before
[SPEAKER_02]: you start feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find vaporizers to be unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never know if I'm going to need one or
six pools off the vaporizer, but take as
[SPEAKER_02]: many as you're comfortable with,
get a little buzz on and sit back for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of seconds and just see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you stoned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get mellow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get low?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get giggly and goofy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you paranoid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have the munchies?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got other friends in the room,
start conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will start talking about the
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll start talking about the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody will mention the taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody will mention the aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conversation will start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention to how your friends react to
your herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a mental note of what you think of
the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the aroma?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the buzz that you've gotten
from the way you've consumed it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it may be time to take a couple of
more puffs and go to the next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you've pushed it a little bit,
how do you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now are you super stoned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you stuck to the couch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you flying off the couch and just
hanging on for dear life?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it making you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it acting to your friends?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they lit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they bored?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, are they enjoying it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention to the words that they're
saying and try to make a mental note of
[SPEAKER_02]: their review of your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about a few things to look
for while you are smoking your first
[SPEAKER_02]: sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's look for some things about the
product to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does your product burn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it burn smoothly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it burn like a charcoal briquet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did it burn a nice white ash?
[SPEAKER_02]: If the ash that you knocked off the end of
your joint or that chunk that you dumped
[SPEAKER_02]: out of your bowl at the end, if that was
chunky and black, you may not have flushed
[SPEAKER_02]: your product long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may want a longer flush time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you may not have dried it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may still be a little bit wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not burning properly, it could
still be a little moist and it needs more
[SPEAKER_02]: dry time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pay attention to how it burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, how does it smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the smoke nice and smooth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that smoke thick and harsh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it hurt your throat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it make you cough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can you just toke on it all day and
blow clouds and it doesn't bother your
[SPEAKER_02]: lungs and throat at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make improvements in your next
grow based on the quality of this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: How is the aroma?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are those things on point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if the flavor and aroma and burn
factor are not on point, you can
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely correct those in your next
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about paying attention to
what your friends say because they are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be very proud of your
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You spent a lot of time on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to think it is the best herb
you've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a very natural thing for new
growers to experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smoke a lot of herb also.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have very influential
feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let their criticism hurt your
feelings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to take their compliments.
[SPEAKER_02]: When one of your friends says,
bro, this shit smells so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe you grew this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to glow.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the other guy says, bro, this kind of
burns my throat, you have to take that
[SPEAKER_02]: criticism as strongly as you did that
compliment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both matter equally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the compliment as a driving force to
move you forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use the criticism as a way to improve your
crop next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be hurt when one of your friends
says, bro, that weed burns my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because you did something wrong and
you need to improve and he was honest with
[SPEAKER_02]: you because he's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned earlier that some of the
things that you may need to improve that
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll notice right away are your
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to take that
criticism as a driving force to improve
your crop next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your friends think you tried and cured
it properly?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're happy, that's what
matters as long as you're consuming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's going to market, it's got to
satisfy the market, so pay attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: what the market says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, how did you trim it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you satisfied with the trim?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are your clients satisfied with the trim?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can improve on the trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of new growers don't trim enough,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could go a little bit harder on your
trim job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you were consuming the product
and you can actually tell what type of
[SPEAKER_02]: buzz it gives you, do you think you should
have flowered a little bit longer or do
[SPEAKER_02]: you think you should have flowered a
little bit shorter?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pay attention to the finished
product and how things came out this time,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you took plenty of notes throughout the
grow, you can look at your notes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can look at your finished product,
and you can see things that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: improve for the next run, which will make
you a better grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take all of those compliments and take
all of that criticism and ball it all up
[SPEAKER_02]: into one big learning lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And think of ways to improve your crop
next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the overall deciding factor on the
quality of this product is how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you going for a low couch lock kind
of a buzz or were you going for a big
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelic head spinning high?
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you get what you were after?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think if you would have let that
plant flower a little bit longer that you
[SPEAKER_02]: would have gotten better quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think maybe you would have gotten a
fatter yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think maybe if you would have
chopped it a little later that it may have
[SPEAKER_02]: started to diminish the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think if you would have cut it a
little bit earlier that it would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more head buzzy and a little bit
racier?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are things to think about as you are
testing the final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you satisfied with your finished
product is the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're satisfied, don't change a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are things that you're not
satisfied with, look at your notes and
[SPEAKER_02]: think of ways that you can improve those
things for your next run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I started off our little science
experiment slash ritual of testing our
[SPEAKER_02]: first crop by sitting in our little
comfortable environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis consumers, stoners, potheads,
whatever you want to call us, I'm okay
[SPEAKER_02]: with all of the above.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this tendency to smoke and get
trapped in our little spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're nice and comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said earlier, the music is just
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The air conditioner is just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fridge is full of snacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bros are right here at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I want to go anywhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you step out of this little
comfort zone, you may be twice as stoned
[SPEAKER_02]: as you even noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really easy to smoke a whole bunch of
product and sit here and be blazed out of
[SPEAKER_02]: your mind to be comfortable because this
is the zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where everything is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a drink right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the dab rig is right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the pen is right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where everything is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no chaos right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for a walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe call an Uber and have them take you
to the mall or to the park.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get out of the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe just go get some food somewhere with
your bros and just get out of the house
[SPEAKER_02]: while you're freshly buzzed on that fresh
new product and see what kind of brand new
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences the world brings to you out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this thing about stoners that once
you smoke, you've got about 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't get up and leave in 10
minutes, you're fucking stuck wherever you
[SPEAKER_02]: just smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So smoke a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're comfortable just hanging out at
the house, do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But next time, take a few puffs of that
new product, call an Uber and go somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting and see what life brings you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may get into some cool new adventures.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, podcast world, that is my talk
about sampling and trying our freshly
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you had as much fun as I did.
