for another Throwback Thursday episode of
[SPEAKER_18]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: Before I get into this long block of

[SPEAKER_18]: disclaimers.
[SPEAKER_18]: If I mention any giveaways, any
advertising or any promotions,
[SPEAKER_18]: all of that stuff has expired Thursday.

these long blocks
[SPEAKER_18]: of episodes.

head right now, putting some THC and or
[SPEAKER_18]: some CBD into your body.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you're getting blazed as shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody at this table is red-eyed.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got a good smile on their face.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got a nice group of people over here
today.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sitting to my left is my new friend Danny
Ono.
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome you to the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_18]: Talk into the microphone for me,
please.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to have to remind everyone to
talk into a microphone.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone's all red-eyed and dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a long fucking day, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: It has been a long day.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you go to Boulder last night or today?
[SPEAKER_15]: I went last night.
[SPEAKER_15]: Went to Boulder and Denver yesterday.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you new to Colorado?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just flew in from New York on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_15]: New York.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you staying or are you just visiting?
[SPEAKER_15]: Just visiting right now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trying to make some moves out here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Trying to make some moves.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it'd be cool to have you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like your company, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, hope you make it out here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_15]: Likewise, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sitting to his left.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you notice how I had to fucking see
which direction that was?
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to be a fun show.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sitting to his left is a repeat offender,
a return guest, our good friend Joe Buzzi.
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back, brother.
[SPEAKER_18]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_23]: Yo, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Glad you showed up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Joe showed up and rolled a couple of
joints, lit them up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: What are we smoking in that joint right
there?
[SPEAKER_23]: This one right here is a mystery kush
plant.
[SPEAKER_23]: It is some unknown bag seed that was grown
and kind of smells lemony, cushy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mystery lemon kush?
[SPEAKER_18]: Mystery kush?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's smoke that shit whenever you're
ready.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for coming again, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sitting to his left, sort of to my
left-ish a little bit still, is my new
[SPEAKER_18]: friend.
[SPEAKER_18]: Diagonal, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, diagonal left.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cesar, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Cesar.
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Talk to the microphone a little bit more
for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go, right up there.
[SPEAKER_18]: News reporter style.
[SPEAKER_18]: Looks good on you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I could do it, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you took a dab earlier and you said it
was going to wreck you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you not a heavy dabber?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just kind of smoke a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thanks for ... Are you from New York
also?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you got that New York accent coming
with you?
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't tape it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's great for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_18]: They get tired of hearing this Colorado
plain voice.
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll enjoy something new.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, are you staying or are you just coming
to visit?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, just coming to visit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, on vacation, good times with
better people, you know.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice, better people, more relaxed vibe
here than on the coast.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure of that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I spend usually 12 hours a day,
six days a week in Manhattan, so.
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gets exhausting.
[SPEAKER_13]: How much does weed cost in Manhattan?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like 50 for an eighth, I mean.
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it any good?
[SPEAKER_13]: Hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's what's got to suck about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to spend that 50 and it's
either going to be, oh yeah, or it's going
[SPEAKER_18]: to be, oh man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you got delivery service where you
are?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I usually just go by my cousin's house
and grab it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Make him do all the footwork.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_17]: Shout out to your cousin.
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't say his name because he's a
criminal.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to end up in a ditch or a
river for fucking saying your cousin's
[SPEAKER_18]: name on here.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, he references that shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, man, thanks for coming on the show
while you're out here visiting.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for taking some visit time to come
hang out.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sitting to his right, which is directly in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have two names in my head I want to call
you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to say Audrey.
[SPEAKER_18]: Am I correct?
[SPEAKER_18]: No.
[SPEAKER_18]: Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I should've went with that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I doubted myself.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_18]: Lindsay, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: You live here now, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I do actually.
[SPEAKER_19]: I just moved out here with Chris when we
came across.
[SPEAKER_18]: How many days ago?
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been here since like December 28th.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so a couple of weeks ish.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we were all over the place in
Colorado just kind of seeing everything
[SPEAKER_19]: and then we kind of like settled down in
Pueblo for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys actually landed in our friend
Sloppy's old house, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're sharing a microphone.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys sitting to her, that's your left,
but my right kind of is our friend Chris,
[SPEAKER_18]: who is actually also known as Bobo Blaster
Co.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_22]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_22]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I do Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_22]: If people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or Chris.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I do the email tables and stuff,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Email tables, shelves, shelves,
all types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cases, Pelican cases.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I have some weird other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have like a little halo helmet set.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's coming out pretty soon too.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a couple little ideas that are in
the works.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's going to make me a small email for
traveling purposes so that if I were to be
[SPEAKER_18]: in somebody's vehicle, maybe there could
be some time.
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually, we were just talking about
that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually have a car version that I'm
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be, you know, for camping,
for when you're camping and you're parked
[SPEAKER_18]: and you want to take a dab in the car that
is parked.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not while you're driving to work.
[SPEAKER_18]: You need a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that would never happen to any of the
professional people in this room.
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: So dude, thanks for, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Grab a mic if you're going to shout.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll just keep reminding you guys,
these guys are new to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't have enough mics for everybody.
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're sharing mics.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're doing it kind of radio station style
or whatever, like a board show style,
[SPEAKER_18]: I think.
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, just grab a mic and slap the guy
next to you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Steal his mic if you feel the urge.
[SPEAKER_22]: Kanye, don't worry about him.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Kanye that bitch.
[SPEAKER_22]: I got something to say.
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be a fun show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: We took plenty of dabs before we got
started.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to give you a big shout out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: Chris, Bobo Blasterco sent me the coolest
dab table of several months ago.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been dabbing on it on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_18]: I take, I'm going to say 10 dabs off that
table every single day.
[SPEAKER_22]: It definitely looks like it got work.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_22]: It has been used.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been put to use.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy to see that.
[SPEAKER_18]: All my Periscope friends have seen it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody that's watched any of my YouTube
videos have seen it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is still going.
[SPEAKER_18]: You sent that thing to me months ago.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was warm when you sent it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because in the Periscope video,
I'm wearing shorts.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was warm when you sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that thing is still rocking.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you say three months ago, four months
ago at 10 dabs a day, whatever kind of
[SPEAKER_18]: math that is, that's a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone looked at Joe.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you compute?
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: See?
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it has stood the test of time.
[SPEAKER_18]: The table has stood up.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the work.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to give you a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it burniture.bigcartel.com?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys go there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell him that you heard about it on the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he will do something special for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: He'll make sure you get hooked to the fuck
up in your order.
[SPEAKER_22]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_22]: You can DM me if you want custom orders
and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you got ideas or thoughts or stuff you
might want to build, definitely DM me on
[SPEAKER_22]: Instagram at BoboBlasterCo.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or definitely send me a message at
TheBurniture.
[SPEAKER_18]: I asked you what you could make into an
email for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And your answer was, it's more about what
I can't make into an email for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you've got the funds and you think
you want it turned into an email,
[SPEAKER_18]: he can probably do it if you're patient.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I wanted was a Nintendo,
an old Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_22]: But then I saw it done.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I didn't want it anymore.
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what's hard about this.
[SPEAKER_22]: Everybody's doing it now.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an easy thing.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're an average electrician,
and you can kind of understand some
[SPEAKER_22]: electrician, you can probably make it.
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's a billion D-Y, I mean D-I,
oh my God.
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we all took dads, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the do-it-yourself videos for days
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_22]: All day.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're on forms all the time.
[SPEAKER_22]: Super stoned.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll cover for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's my fault.
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave him dads, you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave him some.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shout out to Turpex and The Lemon.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_18]: Since we're doing shout outs, I do owe one
shout out to our good friends at Hitman
[SPEAKER_18]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: Big shout out to our friends at Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: When I'm shopping for glass, I want to buy
something made in America, buy an
[SPEAKER_18]: American.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now I'm taking dads out of the
Hitman short stack.
[SPEAKER_18]: These guys were laughing at me because
there's like a gram and a half of reclaims
[SPEAKER_18]: stuck in this thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're like, what are you going to do
with that?
[SPEAKER_18]: One level of that stack is literally just
the wax.
[SPEAKER_18]: This level is where all the wax lies.
[SPEAKER_18]: So shout out to Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shout out to the Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys, I'm trying to participate in the
Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to be there this summer.
[SPEAKER_18]: So shout out to Hitman.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dougie, make sure you follow my friend.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dougie, it's at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dougie on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_18]: Also make sure you check out www
.hitmanglass.com.
[SPEAKER_18]: See what they've got available there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't buy glass from China, you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: These rigs are made in America.
[SPEAKER_18]: Buy Americans.
[SPEAKER_18]: These guys dab as hard as you do.
[SPEAKER_18]: When you see them at trade shows,
they're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're community.
[SPEAKER_18]: Get shit made in America.
[SPEAKER_18]: Support the economy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't buy glass made by a little kid with
no shoes and no protective eyewear,
[SPEAKER_18]: no glasses.
[SPEAKER_18]: Little dude didn't get a lunch break.
[SPEAKER_18]: Got a fucking whip up against his ass all
day.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true though.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's possibly true, you know?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to jump right into another
topic.
[SPEAKER_18]: You said wait for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about this on another episode,
but there's a whole new group of friends
[SPEAKER_18]: here that are actually more involved in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you guys seen the mothership rig that
sold for $101,000?
[SPEAKER_19]: Was it that Sagan collab?
[SPEAKER_19]: Was that what you tagged me in,
Danny?
[SPEAKER_19]: That thing the other day?
[SPEAKER_15]: We were literally just talking about this
this morning.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: Outrageous.
[SPEAKER_19]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_19]: Beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: But outrageous.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like crazy number.
[SPEAKER_19]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, first off, I'm a huge Sagan fan boy.
[SPEAKER_22]: So shout out to Sagan because he's just
got to me.
[SPEAKER_22]: So anything he touches, I'm like,
yes, awesome.
[SPEAKER_22]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's just outlandish.
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: So say you won the Powerball.
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I, can I change it?
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I make my own colors?
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, just like it is.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you won the Powerball, would you throw
it on $101,000 on a glass rig still?
[SPEAKER_22]: Sagan would live in my basement and blow
all day.
[SPEAKER_18]: Please live with me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Build everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you won a hundred, if you won that
billion dollars, you just tie Sagan up and
[SPEAKER_18]: he'd be in the basement blowing a custom.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just high and stumbling around.
[SPEAKER_23]: Stumble into me.
[SPEAKER_23]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_23]: There is a, oh man, just being a high kid
now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of our listeners are right there with
you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you're not taking dab right now,
so that what Joe says makes sense.
Quick.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's hear it, Joe.
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, uh, the auction.
[SPEAKER_23]: So was that mothership event in like for
charity of any kind?
[SPEAKER_23]: Was it all, cause it was all like silent
auction style.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the charity was Scott Depp.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's fucking pocket.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I think that charity was for.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: I did not know.
[SPEAKER_23]: I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know that there was a charity
involved.
[SPEAKER_23]: The only way I could somehow justify
spending a hundred thousand dollars on a
[SPEAKER_23]: glass piece is if you could somehow write
it off.
[SPEAKER_23]: And if it was involved with a charity,
that might be the way that they finagle
[SPEAKER_23]: it.
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, I think it was at,
um, it was at one of the trade shows that
[SPEAKER_18]: happened on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was either Vegas or the West coast.
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, mothership had a huge booth
there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And instead of, this is what I think,
what I was told by somebody, instead of
[SPEAKER_18]: selling mothership rigs, they've learned
that they can make a lot more money by
[SPEAKER_18]: creating demand at these events.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause people are hyped.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's how they got a hundred and one
instead of a hundred is cause two people
[SPEAKER_18]: were fighting and one dude said
one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_18]: One guy said a hundred and a hundred and
one got it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm pretty sure it's just, you go to
the events and I've done it myself.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've bought overpriced fucking rigs at
events cause it's in front of me and it's
[SPEAKER_18]: hyped and it sounds like a good deal.
[SPEAKER_18]: And instead of it being 1200, it's only
nine 50 today.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I feel like I got a sweet ass deal.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you buy it and then you get home and
you're like, Oh fuck, I just bought this
[SPEAKER_18]: rig.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to pay rent.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've all done something like that before,
but that's how you create the hype.
[SPEAKER_18]: This dude next to me holds up his new rig.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, this show is sponsored by hitman
glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're talking about mothership right now,
but dude, this rig is nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, this rig comes from illusions glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the ill glass flux capacitor.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, it is the right size.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got a quartz banger on it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like the mouthpiece on it and it's
sturdy enough for the email.
[SPEAKER_18]: So nice purchase, dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I got it at half off actually at
illusions.
[SPEAKER_18]: They got them on the fucking hype.
[SPEAKER_18]: They marked it up double what it should be
and sold it to you at half price.
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, I'll take it any day.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good rig.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like how thick the glass is.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can tell it's not made by some Chinese
kid with no protective eyewear.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was made in Colorado at ill glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can all agree that that rig was a
little bit overpriced, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Even the, even the Sagan fan boy over here
is like, yeah, that was too much.
[SPEAKER_23]: Any rig over like, say realistically
$2,500 overpriced.
[SPEAKER_23]: Like I a hundred percent understand that
you're paying for the craftsmanship and
[SPEAKER_23]: the dedication that the person has put
into learning and perfecting an art form.
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what you're really in the time
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_23]: But like, but I'm just trying to think of
a realistic number that isn't affected by
[SPEAKER_23]: market value or like the value the
market's putting.
[SPEAKER_18]: It kind of depends on, I'm sure everybody
in this room makes a different paycheck
[SPEAKER_18]: and it kind of depends on which person
will go, no, that's too much for a rig.
[SPEAKER_18]: And different people will be like,
yeah, I pay that for a rig.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it just kind of depends on where you
are.
[SPEAKER_18]: And there have been times in my life where
I would have been like a hundred bucks for
[SPEAKER_18]: a glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_18]: But now they're, I'm like sitting here
hitting this hit man short stack that we
[SPEAKER_18]: all know is not a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_18]: So just times have changed and people
change.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's all, it's all a, what is it
subjective?
[SPEAKER_18]: Like what's over profit?
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been an over a thousand or 2000 bucks
for a piece of glass you could drop and
[SPEAKER_18]: break.
[SPEAKER_18]: And this rig over here, this one is closer
to the four or five and it hits like a
[SPEAKER_18]: boss and it's a hash pipe still,
no matter how much you pay for it,
[SPEAKER_18]: how pretty it is, it's a hash pipe.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the only way I could feel like I
would justify even spending a reasonable
[SPEAKER_15]: amount of money is if you're buying it for
a sculpture like aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like a banjo piece for instance,
right?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we just went to the lazy lion,
like the banjo Joe piece.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like more of an art piece than
anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: And like even that I don't even think is
anywhere near a hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: But there are so many things.
[SPEAKER_18]: I could buy a car with, I could buy four
cars with a hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_18]: Really nice car.
[SPEAKER_18]: I could buy a house.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I could buy a college education with
that kind of money.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, a week or two at college.
[SPEAKER_23]: You could realistically own a skyscraper
in Detroit with that much money.
[SPEAKER_23]: You could own fucking Detroit with that
much money right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, Detroit.
[SPEAKER_18]: That was rude.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I mean, you could buy a few blocks
probably.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we're going to move on from that.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's nothing incorrect about those
statements.
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, nothing negative.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_18]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_18]: Me as well.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just saying why are rigs $25,000.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a few, there's one, there's like
maybe an SD rhino rig I'd pay good money
[SPEAKER_18]: for and probably a couple of coil pieces
that I pay good money for.
[SPEAKER_18]: But then you guys ever have that feeling
when you're like, I'm going to go buy
[SPEAKER_18]: something and you get to the store and you
grab it and you carry it up to the cash
[SPEAKER_18]: register and the lady tells you how much
it is.
[SPEAKER_18]: Something inside you is like, I just want
to fucking put it back.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I have to take that much money out of
my pocket and give it to you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I was cool with it until like this
moment.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost bought a mothership for 2,500
bucks.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the day before I drove to Denver to go
get it, I woke up and I was like,
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to take all these hundred dollar
bills and give them to somebody right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like it was a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_18]: So needless to say, I came to my senses
and did not purchase a $2,500 mothership.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's just something that I can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_18]: It feels weird.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to be the most expensive rig
on the table for a long time.
[SPEAKER_18]: And this was actually sent to me by our
friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this, this will remain the priciest rig
on the table for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm, I don't want anybody to think that
I'm hating on these dudes who are making
[SPEAKER_23]: bank selling their glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's amazing and awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's great that these guys can support
their families and their kids are going to
[SPEAKER_18]: college now because this dude made art and
it sold for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_23]: When you approach it from, okay,
see I was never, I was not approaching my
[SPEAKER_23]: argument from the art standpoint.
[SPEAKER_23]: I was approaching it from the,
this is a bong.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's no matter how pretty it is,
which, so I talked about it on another
[SPEAKER_18]: episode, but let's, let's look at a
picture of it since we're, we're all going
[SPEAKER_18]: to this other people that listened to that
episode might be listening to this one and
[SPEAKER_18]: didn't hear that episode.
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's go to Instagram right quick.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to pull up a picture and share
it with everybody so we can all see it
[SPEAKER_18]: together.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh crap.
[SPEAKER_18]: I searched for a lot of stuff here.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just going to go hashtag mothership
and it'll come up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just different angles.
[SPEAKER_18]: So do you, can we agree?
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't see it yet.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we all agree that it looks like
something that maybe Tim Burton would have
[SPEAKER_18]: made or maybe if Les Claypool had become a
glassblower, maybe Les Claypool would have
[SPEAKER_18]: made this thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a picture of it here, but it's not
the picture I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shout out to Primus all day there.
[SPEAKER_18]: They played yesterday in California and I
heard the show was amazing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's look at this piece right here.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is got on the top of the mouthpiece is
supposed to be a moon.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then it has got, I think that color is
called stardust, but it's got other stuff
[SPEAKER_18]: in it with this like metallic iridescent
glittery shit that just drives my eyes
[SPEAKER_18]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't even focus on it properly.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, then it is, it's a Faberge egg
underneath that, but it's made with such a
[SPEAKER_18]: dark glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't see through it to see the proper
shape of the egg.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it looks like a hand grenade to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys agree with that?
[SPEAKER_18]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's kind of it's like reflected stained
glass on a lake that's rippling.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's nice, but I mean, it's so ugly at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_23]: A hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mothership is known a hundred and one.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's that extra one.
[SPEAKER_18]: They still got to pay taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mothership is known for really like
smooth, sleek, tight glass with like no
[SPEAKER_18]: extra shit on it and really nice function.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Clear function, like a clear color,
maybe like a the piss yellow lemon drop or
[SPEAKER_18]: the pink or blue, the, uh, Azure blue is
really nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: And this thing is just gaudy and overdone.
[SPEAKER_18]: In my opinion, this little moon down here,
they sent that to the moon, uh,
[SPEAKER_18]: to space in a weather balloon.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: He did a whole set of pendies.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's got these moons around it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got a bunch of moons attached to it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's supposed to be the actual
phases of the moon.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you'd spin it around, it goes through
the moon phases.
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like they made a cheap bong and
glued a bunch of fucking moons onto it.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to buy it and glue a little rocket
ship to it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to quit bashing this mothership
ring.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm being rude now.
[SPEAKER_22]: And there goes Ross and Jeff's custom Irie
genetics mothership not coming in the
[SPEAKER_22]: mail.
[SPEAKER_22]: Right?
[SPEAKER_20]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_18]: They can send me one of the race car
series any day of the week.
[SPEAKER_18]: That blue race car is dope.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, if there's a green race car series,
I got cash in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody bought the red one up right away.
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_18]: But that race car series, I will take it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, anything that's not a fixie for
mothership, I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_23]: What I want to say is the reason that
cosmic peace gets away with it is because
[SPEAKER_23]: it is a collab because it's not a straight
up mothership piece.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a mothership base.
[SPEAKER_23]: And then an artist went to town on it.
[SPEAKER_18]: What the fuck did town on it too.
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that's why it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_23]: And that will probably never get smoked
out of.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, they were dabbing out of it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like hours after they bought it,
there are pictures on Instagram of these
[SPEAKER_18]: dudes dabbing out of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you didn't, you're just ridiculous
then.
[SPEAKER_15]: How often are you really going to use
that?
[SPEAKER_18]: My hand would be on it while you dab out
of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: My head would be on it while you dab out
of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be like, no, I got it.
[SPEAKER_18]: You stick your head in the case.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, you guys check out this rig.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you'd go to a mothership glass on
Instagram, you'll see what we're talking
[SPEAKER_18]: about.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is redonkulous.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, also here's something I've been seeing
on, uh, social media sites.
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you guys seen the super clear hash
that somebody made?
[SPEAKER_18]: Super clear.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is clear as glass.
[SPEAKER_23]: In which, in which state are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_23]: Not, not, not United States, like which,
which phase is the hash in?
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're holding it in their hand with a
rubber glove and behind them is an across
[SPEAKER_18]: international vac oven.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they just hold it in front of the
camera and took the picture and there was
[SPEAKER_18]: no caption.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the picture went up and stayed up for
like three or four days.
[SPEAKER_18]: And people went nuts over this hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause it was as clear as this rig.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was super clear.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys didn't see it?
[SPEAKER_18]: No.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I see this?
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'm just going to ruin all your
guys' fun.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was ice.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just straight up a piece of ice.
[SPEAKER_18]: But since they wore a rubber glove and
took a picture of it in front of a vac
[SPEAKER_18]: oven and didn't post anything,
everybody's mind just went, look at that
[SPEAKER_18]: clear hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody just jerked off and had a
fucking orgasm to it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So many of my friends, I'm, I'm a lot of
people's cannabis expert.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm their weed guy and people were sending
me the picture all day.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, is this real?
[SPEAKER_18]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this real?
[SPEAKER_18]: And finally I messaged them.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, where can you find this?
[SPEAKER_18]: How much a gram?
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I messaged them.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, what is that exactly?
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like ice to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're like, it's ice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no comment or anything.
[SPEAKER_18]: They just posted the picture and they just
let everybody assume.
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody's minds went right to,
Oh my God, look at this hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause they saw rubber gloves in a vac
oven.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what, you know, if you see
lotion and a Kleenex in your buddy's
[SPEAKER_18]: bedroom, you think he's jerking off.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's if you got fucking vac oven and
rubber gloves, you're making hash.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_18]: The girl in the room almost spit her water
on me just now.
[SPEAKER_18]: The only female in the room almost lost
her shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_18]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we talked about that on the show
yesterday, but you guys are more in the
[SPEAKER_18]: loop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_18]: The guys over here yesterday, our local
dudes that aren't is hip into the scene.
[SPEAKER_18]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you guys are listening, you know what
I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you guys just moved here.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys got a brand new house.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys were spoiled because you moved
into sloppy's house that may have already
[SPEAKER_18]: been equipped for growing.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you had chosen to grow in there,
a lot of people that are going to move
[SPEAKER_18]: here aren't going to have that advantage.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a few minutes left in the show
that we could keep going for a few
[SPEAKER_18]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's talk about things that if people
were going to move to a house in Colorado
[SPEAKER_18]: and you plan to grow, what are some things
you should look at when you're looking for
[SPEAKER_18]: a house before you move in?
[SPEAKER_18]: Have this in mind before I move here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at this when you're looking at houses
if you plan to grow there.
[SPEAKER_18]: The first thing just to get it rolling,
make sure you've got enough electricity
[SPEAKER_18]: coming into the house.
[SPEAKER_18]: The power is really limited.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you get an older house, you may have
like a 50 or an 80 amp maximum in your
[SPEAKER_18]: house.
[SPEAKER_18]: My house, we could pull 200 amps here.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm in a nice big fancy residential
area, but some homes you can't pull enough
[SPEAKER_18]: power to run more than two or three or
three or four lights.
[SPEAKER_18]: So definitely check out the electricity.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're going to have an electrician
come, here's a good segue into the next
[SPEAKER_18]: thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check out the landlord.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something to really think about.
[SPEAKER_18]: You just rolled your eyes.
[SPEAKER_18]: You had a fucking experience.
[SPEAKER_18]: I could see it on your face.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not with growing, but like, yeah,
with landlords in general.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So imagine if that dickhead landlord is at
your front door and you've got to grow in
[SPEAKER_18]: the basement.
[SPEAKER_18]: He wants to come in and do something and
there's no keeping him out.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got to make sure you got a good
landlord.
[SPEAKER_18]: Fortunately, my landlord lives in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_18]: So they have been here once since I moved
in.
[SPEAKER_18]: In the past like eight years, they drive
by when they came to visit their family
[SPEAKER_18]: and they're like, the front yard looks
great.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was pretty much what I got from
them.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So find a landlord.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you can find one of those rental
agencies that they rent you the house and
[SPEAKER_18]: they forget about you, as long as you send
that check every month, if you can find a
[SPEAKER_18]: place like that.
[SPEAKER_23]: Those are rare in Colorado because
they're, because they are aware of what
[SPEAKER_23]: people are renting houses to do.
[SPEAKER_17]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_23]: You really want to find like a local
landlord.
[SPEAKER_23]: If you are planning to grow, it's very
easy to grow legally here.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no reason to grow illegally when
it's so easy to have all your paperwork in
[SPEAKER_23]: order.
[SPEAKER_23]: And then, and oh, I forgot where I was
going with that.
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, have a good time.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's other things for your grow room
too, like what are you doing for your
[SPEAKER_23]: ventilation?
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_23]: Is your landlord cool with you modifying
the house?
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: You might have to cut some ducting holes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: You environment is key.
[SPEAKER_23]: Think about how many rooms does a house
have?
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you going to have enough room to
adequately grow?
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't have crazy expectations.
[SPEAKER_22]: Not your two closets and your one little
room.
[SPEAKER_22]: And then all of a sudden you have three
bedrooms filled.
[SPEAKER_22]: You're like, I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how growing goes.
[SPEAKER_18]: You move to Colorado, you hang one light
and you're like, look, I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're like, well, now I need a bedroom
and a flower room.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you're like, now I need veg,
flower, clones, and moms.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're like, no, I'm going to breed in
this other room.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you're like, oh shit,
now where do I start?
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you go in another house with
another landlord and doing it all over.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: That shit happens in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_18]: So like Joe said, have a good roommate or
have a good landlord.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't get any fucking roommates.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're growing weed.
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll pay the other bills.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't get any roommates.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll screw everything up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Angry roommates are one of the,
no offense, but angry girlfriends and
[SPEAKER_18]: angry roommates are one of the leading
causes of garden failure.
[SPEAKER_18]: And angry partners.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't have another partner.
[SPEAKER_18]: Do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_18]: Get your own house, set that shit up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing, make sure there is access
to water.
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to get plenty of water to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to need, I say probably about
five gallons of water per light every
[SPEAKER_18]: three days.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's every thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll need about five gallons of water
every three days.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's in my experience.
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's too hot, you're going to have to
get more water.
[SPEAKER_18]: Find a place that you can control the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of basements get really,
really cold and dank in the winter.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to think this is going to be
awesome, but that coldness will give you
[SPEAKER_18]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_18]: That drastic change from hot to cold is a
huge, huge cause of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_18]: The plants don't know what to do with
that.
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll freak out.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll get mold.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll fuck up the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, a lot of the basements around here,
the basements are just dirty.
[SPEAKER_18]: You would not want to grow in any basement
around here until you kind of frame it out
[SPEAKER_18]: or build something in there.
[SPEAKER_18]: So look and see how dirty, how dusty,
how funky the place is.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check your pipes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you're not going to have any
busting pipes in the basement.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I keep saying basements,
but basements are the best place for a
[SPEAKER_18]: grow in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_18]: The temperature is easier to maintain.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody goes down there.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little more easy to keep private.
[SPEAKER_18]: So make sure it's not real dirty.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you got somewhere for the water
to go.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure maybe you got a floor drain or a
way to get rid of the water.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe if you got an old bathroom shower,
an old shower down in the basement or an
[SPEAKER_18]: old toilet down there, make sure you just
have somewhere to dispose of water because
[SPEAKER_18]: there will be water.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure your neighbors aren't right on
top of you.
[SPEAKER_18]: My neighbors are a few feet away.
[SPEAKER_18]: If they were any closer, I would be
uncomfortable having any blowers coming
[SPEAKER_18]: out of any windows.
[SPEAKER_18]: It wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So make sure your neighbors are cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you don't live next to any cops.
[SPEAKER_21]: That should be rule number one,
actually.
[SPEAKER_21]: Tip number one.
[SPEAKER_18]: Or just bust it out right in front of the
cop's house and he'll never fucking notice
[SPEAKER_18]: because he'll be like, why would that
asshole grow there?
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's another tip.
[SPEAKER_18]: When you move in, don't go carrying in
your grow lights and your hydro setup all
[SPEAKER_18]: at one time.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you can drive the car into the garage
and unload there,
[SPEAKER_18]: do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't show up with seven lights.
[SPEAKER_18]: You need water.
[SPEAKER_18]: You need somewhere to get rid of the
water.
[SPEAKER_18]: You need cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_18]: You need some way to feel secure.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't buy a house that's got old ass
doors, old ass doorknobs.
[SPEAKER_18]: Pay attention to your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's easier to get away with the grow in
the hood, but it's also easier to get your
[SPEAKER_18]: grow fucking stolen in the hood.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a kind of a boundary you have
to work with there.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys are right on that cusp in your
new house.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of, it's hood enough,
but it's a little hood.
[SPEAKER_22]: All our neighbors seem pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't had any issues.
[SPEAKER_22]: They all are happy.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Slop was there before us,
so that's... Slop regulated.
[SPEAKER_18]: Slop came in and laid down the law.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shout out to Sloppy for not taking any
shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like that kid.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love that kid.
[SPEAKER_18]: Slop, I owe you a hug, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sloppy, give us grateful debt tickets.
[SPEAKER_22]: Secret fact, he's actually a little...
There's a little beef going on with you
[SPEAKER_22]: guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: You didn't know about that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_18]: There can't be beef.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a vegetarian, brother.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that's true.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sloppy, I love you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll come give you a hug.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll fucking put on my shoes and drive
over there after this, even though I
[SPEAKER_18]: should not, because it's late,
but I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't want no beef.
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't been to your new house yet.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I owe you that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You gave me some grateful debt tickets,
bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't seen you since then.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why you're sleeping.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.
[SPEAKER_18]: But that ninja's got to keep in mind,
I worked 50 miles.
[SPEAKER_21]: He said that.
[SPEAKER_21]: He said that.
[SPEAKER_21]: He said that.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to be honest.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know he works a lot, but bruh.
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't had a dig off.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't sleep for 10 minutes and just
dab me up.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not complaining, but I haven't had a
day off in over 32 days.
[SPEAKER_18]: The last time I came, it was 32 days to my
last day off.
[SPEAKER_18]: So sorry, Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_18]: On day 36, when I get that day off,
I'm going to come give you a hug and a
[SPEAKER_18]: kiss on the cheek.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll play with that big old fucking Afro
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just commenting on it last night.
[SPEAKER_19]: It is so round and perfect now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's name Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got to be something really good.
[SPEAKER_18]: Listeners, call to action.
[SPEAKER_18]: We would like you to name my friend
Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hit me up on the Grow From Your Heart
podcast Twitter page at GFYH podcast and
[SPEAKER_18]: name Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hashtag name Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hashtag name Sloppy's Afro.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have a Twitter, but I might get
one just for that.
Defroto.
[SPEAKER_17]: Defroto.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's named Frodo.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it's fucking name is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Contest over.
[SPEAKER_18]: Contest over.
[SPEAKER_18]: Winner to the left.
[SPEAKER_18]: You won a flux capacitor rig from LBS.
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_18]: You won half off.
[SPEAKER_18]: We only marked it up triple price.
[SPEAKER_18]: It may not pass on just for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you've made it listening this far,
I fucking love you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for listening to our podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a lot, a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody told me it would be really funny
if I said, Hey Siri, Google Golden Goat on
[SPEAKER_18]: my podcast, because a lot of people have
an app on their phone called Siri.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you say, Hey Siri, it activates it,
makes it start working.
[SPEAKER_18]: So now people's phones are randomly
Googling Golden Goat, if that worked.
[SPEAKER_18]: Haha.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody told me to try that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me know if that worked.
[SPEAKER_18]: If I fucked up your phone, that's really
funny to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I fucked up your phone, I'm laughing
about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you've got Hey Siri turned on,
that was your fault.
[SPEAKER_18]: My phone didn't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So guys, I'm going to put together an
episode all about getting your badge.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm pretty sure we did a short episode
about that, but two, maybe three people
[SPEAKER_18]: have asked me to do an episode all about
getting your badge.
[SPEAKER_18]: Also shout out to the mama that worked on
my dreadlocks for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: She is one of the people that said I
should do an episode about getting her
[SPEAKER_18]: badge.
[SPEAKER_18]: She's a manager at a shop and a lot of
people come in without badges and they ask
[SPEAKER_18]: her how to do it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if she had a podcast to refer them to,
it would help her out.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to make that episode.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for working on my dreads.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get that episode for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: The dreads look sweet.
[SPEAKER_18]: They feel so good.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we should shout out everybody's Twitter
pages or Instagram or some way to find all
[SPEAKER_18]: these weird fuckers that you guys were
just listening to.
[SPEAKER_18]: A bunch of good people.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll start over here.
[SPEAKER_18]: You said you had an Instagram earlier.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's creative K-R-E-A-T-I-V-E underscore
chaos K-A-O-S.
[SPEAKER_18]: That is creative.
[SPEAKER_18]: Joe Buzzi, do you have any way that you'd
like people to follow you or do you just
[SPEAKER_18]: want to remain anonymous over here?
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_23]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not difficult.
[SPEAKER_13]: You really tried.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got anything you want to share with
us, Cesar?
[SPEAKER_18]: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I, I really don't do anything
exciting.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to follow, if you want to
follow me building my Jeep, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: at Shavo 4518, C-H-A-B-O-4-5-1-8.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone will check that out.
[SPEAKER_18]: You might find the girl of your dreams
right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just creeping on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_18]: She might be checking you out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you into?
[SPEAKER_17]: If I'm trying to date you, what are you
into?
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to work on your Jeep and then
we're going to go, we're going to go to
[SPEAKER_17]: the boardwalk.
[SPEAKER_17]: No sunsets.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Your little favorite Italian restaurant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do love sunsets.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do love the sunsets.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like sunsets and big tits.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am a sucker for big tits.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sunsets and big tits.
[SPEAKER_18]: They get everything jumbled up in there.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're looking for a girl that likes
Italian food, got big boobs, ready to go
[SPEAKER_18]: on the sunset, ride in the Jeep,
smoke some good dough.
[SPEAKER_18]: And in the Manhattan area?
[SPEAKER_13]: You're like, I'll fucking drive.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one most powerful thing out here
in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is pussy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wondered for a minute, I was like,
am I going to take that out?
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm fucking not.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause I think the man is right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let it ride.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let it ride.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for taking time out of your day to
be on my show.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: How about you, young lady?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I am the traveling stoner on Instagram and
all other social media.
[SPEAKER_18]: All other social media.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you traveling?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you a stoner?
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to make sure you're not
fucking around, not faking the funk.
[SPEAKER_19]: Never.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're the one that I'm talking to a
lot of the time on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that is me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.
[SPEAKER_19]: I knew that was going to come up once I
said it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was pretty sure that was you.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was pretty sure that was you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_19]: So now I can finally tell you that it was,
the reason I even got a Periscope was
[SPEAKER_19]: because my favorite thing is when he would
jump into your Periscopes.
[SPEAKER_19]: The way you say Bobo Blastercoat used to
make me giggle so much that I went and got
[SPEAKER_19]: a Periscope so I could hear you say the
traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish you would have been there the first
time, but I giggled so hard.
[SPEAKER_21]: She was so excited for that.
[SPEAKER_21]: She was like, wait for it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait for it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause there's the delay.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're like, wait for it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, hello, the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_21]: And she's like, yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm making people giggle.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: On Periscope.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys follow me on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't do as many videos as I used to
because I'm fucking working all the time.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sloppy bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love you, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just busy, dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_18]: We still got a bromance.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're still my Tuesday bitch,
Slop.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you check out the traveling
stoner.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you check out the traveling
stoner follower.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure she posts some good pictures.
[SPEAKER_18]: I might look one day.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, now my friend over here, Mr. Bobo
Blastercoat.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: You've got a lot of stuff to plug.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got the burniture stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: How can people find burniture?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: The easiest way to find burniture is
burniture.bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_22]: Or you can hit me up on Instagram at Bobo
Blaster Co.
Co.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_18]: She giggled right in my face.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_18]: I fully endorse his product, you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: It takes a lot to get me to endorse your
product.
[SPEAKER_18]: The only brands I really represent right
now are highly educated titanium,
[SPEAKER_18]: oil slick, hitman glass, turpex,
of course, team green and healthy.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Bobo Blaster Co, the burniture,
because that shit works.
[SPEAKER_18]: I put it to the test.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I was hoping that.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was expecting you to come back with
like, all right, give me like a six,
[SPEAKER_22]: a five.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was like, all right, I got to go
back to the drawing table, fix out a
[SPEAKER_22]: little tweaks and send you a new one.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm like, all right, test this one now.
[SPEAKER_18]: The green button gets warm.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's like my only complaint.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my only issue when I've already
fixed it.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I've said.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why I can't wait to refurbish that
one back to brand new for you.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_18]: Add two more at the other end.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_18]: It'd be way too crowded.
[SPEAKER_18]: It'd get hectic.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the table though.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys check out the tables.
[SPEAKER_18]: When you buy your table, if there's a
comment section, on Big Cartel,
[SPEAKER_18]: I do not know what the shopping cart looks
like.
[SPEAKER_18]: If there's a comment section, make sure
you type in there.
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard about this through Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_18]: Rasta Jeff told me something grew from
your podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let him know so that we can high-five each
other.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he knows where the sales are coming
from, where the business has happened.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's always nice for us to know that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So does anybody have any sort of important
message you'd like to relay to the world
[SPEAKER_18]: before I start closing up the show here?
[SPEAKER_18]: No.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got nothing.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's got nothing.
[SPEAKER_18]: My message for the day is don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's good enough, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_18]: Be nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Give each other a hug.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a new year.
[SPEAKER_18]: Forgive somebody.
[SPEAKER_18]: Give them a new start.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank all you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_18]: That was fucking awesome.

[SPEAKER_18]: No, he's going to come out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he's going to come move out here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's two states that I've come to visit
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we're going to get C to come move out
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're traveling with you guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's the traveling Italian.
[SPEAKER_17]: He's Italian.
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm Cuban, B.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're traveling Cuban.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

[SPEAKER_05]: I just go with the train windows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sending love to my friends and foes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling
in the West Indies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I provide all my wants and needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the sunshine, rivers, and trees.
[SPEAKER_16]: Relief.
[SPEAKER_16]: Africa in our soul, but Asia in our heart.
[SPEAKER_16]: It is of importance for I and I gather.
[SPEAKER_16]: If we cannot show now a balance that we
had, how do we propose then to carry it
[SPEAKER_16]: abroad?
[SPEAKER_16]: Then go to Ethiopia and you'll not have a
plan.
[SPEAKER_16]: The building of a nation and a helper on
every one.
[SPEAKER_16]: A lover one, a man is just a man.
[SPEAKER_16]: It shall be a coronation when we learn,

[SPEAKER_16]: Who knows, who knows, who knows,

[SPEAKER_05]: I just go with the train windows.

[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the help.
[SPEAKER_18]: Life is turpy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's all the shout outs I got
for you today, guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: On this episode, this is the episode where
I have the lovely Miss Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll drop that in here just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to the Denver Patient Support Group
in Denver at a place called Castleman's
[SPEAKER_18]: and I was granted a 10 minute interview
with the lovely Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll play that here in just a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_18]: Before I get to that, I want to read a
news article.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me turn on the music.
[SPEAKER_18]: This article actually comes from the
extractsuntimes.com.
[SPEAKER_18]: I found this on the internet, of course.
[SPEAKER_18]: Lately, there have been some revelations
made in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you've got a commercial grow or a
private grow, you may want to hear this.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're using a product called Guardian,
you need to get that stuff out of your
[SPEAKER_18]: garden, out of your place.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is not something you want to be
spraying.
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's get right into the article here.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm looking for an author here.
[SPEAKER_18]: It says, written by Emily Gray,
[SPEAKER_18]: a popular pesticide approved last week by
Oregon health officials for use on
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis plants has now been removed from
the list of acceptable marijuana
[SPEAKER_18]: pesticides due to detection of a
controversial chemical ingredient as
[SPEAKER_18]: reported by the Oregonian.
[SPEAKER_18]: And guys, this is an article from Oregon,
but soon you will see how this applies to
[SPEAKER_18]: you.
[SPEAKER_18]: A marijuana testing lab in Eugene found
traces of the chemical abamectin in
[SPEAKER_18]: supposedly organically grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: And discovered growers had been using a
pesticide called Guardian mitespray.
[SPEAKER_18]: Guardian mitespray includes natural
ingredients such as lemon oil and cinnamon
[SPEAKER_18]: among its active ingredients and is
marketed as an all-natural product.
[SPEAKER_18]: Abamectin was not listed as an active
ingredient on the product label.
[SPEAKER_18]: The pesticide has become widely popular
because it's more effective than any harsh
[SPEAKER_18]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_18]: Neil Bernstein, owner of Roots Garden
Supply, told the Oregonian.
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, it's more effective.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're lying in their shin that they
didn't tell you about.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll continue to read.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oregon's Department of Agriculture has
temporarily removed the product from its
[SPEAKER_18]: list of approved cannabis pesticides until
further investigation can be conducted.
[SPEAKER_18]: Abamectin is commonly used in fruit and
vegetable production, but those produce
[SPEAKER_18]: items are not marketed or sold as organic
according to Green Rush Daily.
[SPEAKER_18]: Detection of this chemical in allegedly
organic marijuana is problematic because
[SPEAKER_18]: people often pay a higher premium for
organically grown cannabis, especially
[SPEAKER_18]: medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this company was putting out a
pesticide and they were having great
[SPEAKER_18]: success with it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was taking down all of the problems,
but they were not listing the abamectin on
[SPEAKER_18]: the label, which is not an organic
compound or chemical, and it was clearly
[SPEAKER_18]: in the product.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there may be, if this was a rule in
Colorado, if this product was banned in
[SPEAKER_18]: Colorado and this was applied to a crop in
Colorado and a lab found this,
[SPEAKER_18]: that crop would be recalled and none of
the products made with the trim or the
[SPEAKER_18]: buds of that crop would be allowed to be
sold in a dispensary, the product would
[SPEAKER_18]: all have to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_18]: People would lose a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope the people for Guardian are held
accountable when that time comes.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a gray area because cannabis is
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if we can sue for that,
but if crops have to be thrown away
[SPEAKER_18]: because Guardian was applied and there was
an ingredient not listed on the label,
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope the folks from Guardian can be held
accountable for that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have posted to Facebook that I'm trying
to get in touch with the people from
[SPEAKER_18]: Guardian and their website is gone.
[SPEAKER_18]: The distributors and vendors that I was
aware of for Guardian have disappeared.
[SPEAKER_18]: I cannot find them.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you work for Guardian or you are a part
of Guardian Might Spray and you'd like to
[SPEAKER_18]: talk to me on behalf of Guardian on this
show and tell us what's up, why that shit
[SPEAKER_18]: wasn't listed on there, or if you have
something to say, I will give you time on
[SPEAKER_18]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: All you have to do is contact me.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's an open invitation to come be on
the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let us know what's going on with this.
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't even have to come to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can come to you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got portable podcasting equipment.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do it over Skype.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do it over FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do it through a simple phone call.
[SPEAKER_18]: However you guys would like to be on the
show, this is an open invitation.
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to know why that was not
listed on the label of your product.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure you knew it was in there because
you had to pay for it to put it in the
[SPEAKER_18]: product.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, and if anybody else has
Guardian in their garden or in your garden
[SPEAKER_18]: pantry area, properly dispose of that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I honestly do not know the proper
procedure for disposing of a bottle of
[SPEAKER_18]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_18]: But please do some research and get rid of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you've already applied Guardian to your
personal crop, you should be okay.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not organic anymore.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't say it was organic.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you've got a commercial crop and
you've applied Guardian in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you pass all of the testing when it
comes up.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys, if you're thinking about making
a product for the legal cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_18]: is just getting started.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you're part of this evolution of
the cannabis industry, before it goes
[SPEAKER_18]: nationwide, you would have the opportunity
to be in a huge business.
[SPEAKER_18]: But instead these guys pretty much just
got blackballed.
[SPEAKER_18]: So don't be these guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_18]: Be a good person.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, guys, I'm going to time warp us
back a few days and we're going to go to
[SPEAKER_18]: Denver, Colorado to Castleman's where we
had the Denver patient support group with
[SPEAKER_18]: our lovely speaker, Ms. Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_18]: This was a very great interview.
[SPEAKER_18]: This was the first interview I've ever had
where the person I was interviewing had an
[SPEAKER_18]: assistant who was keeping time.
[SPEAKER_18]: She told me you have 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_18]: When the interview started, she put her
hands up and showed me 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_18]: When nine minutes happened, she showed me
nine.
[SPEAKER_18]: When five minutes came around,
she showed me the five.
[SPEAKER_18]: When three minutes came up, I got the
three.
[SPEAKER_18]: About one minute, she kind of gave me the
look.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I knew it was time to wrap up the
interview.
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms. Charlo was on a tight schedule.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I do appreciate her for taking a 10
minute chunk out of her night to do an
[SPEAKER_18]: interview with me.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you guys, here we go.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's spin back in time.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to Castleman's in Denver,
and ladies and gentlemen, Rasta,
[SPEAKER_18]: Jeff and Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back, podcast listeners.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm here at the Denver Cannabis Patient
Support Group at Castleman's in Denver,
[SPEAKER_18]: and I am joined on mic by the lovely
Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for having me, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a great event.
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a lot of people here already.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of early and we still are
already getting people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're filling up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this shows just how excited people
are for this opportunity to share their
[SPEAKER_12]: own experiences and learn.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, now that you guys have passed that
barrier that most of the rest of us are
[SPEAKER_12]: fighting for, we're all watching to see
what you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fact that so many people are
taking initiative to educate themselves,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's encouraging.
[SPEAKER_18]: Education.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the key here tonight, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_18]: I see a lot of vendors here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody has their educational info.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not like they're here doing a swap
meet trying to sell.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love the vibe that people have brought.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's more of an educational and not give
me your money, which is what we've needed
[SPEAKER_18]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a service.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a trade show.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a fair.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for doing that for us.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems like every time we have an event
like this, they're just trying to pull
[SPEAKER_18]: money out of our pockets.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you noticed that?
[SPEAKER_18]: I've kind of noticed that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, same here.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've forgotten what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've forgotten medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've gone all recreational.
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've forgotten about the patients.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a patient myself.
[SPEAKER_18]: So on behalf of all of the Colorado
patients, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I am thrilled to be co-hosting with
Dr. Michelle Ross, who also sits on the
[SPEAKER_12]: Board of Advisors for MD Herb,
which is a medical marijuana resource.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you guys Google that right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Do they have a website?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, mderb.org.
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_18]: Guys, check that out.
[SPEAKER_18]: Support that.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a good cause.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're kind of well known for your fuck
it, I quit statement on the news.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of my listeners might not be
familiar with who you are.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you give us maybe a brief history
lesson up to today?
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'll talk about the event.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was working as a news anchor in
Anchorage, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_12]: I became the cannabis reporter and I
learned about the true harm surrounding
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to meet the patients that were
being affected by our broken medical
[SPEAKER_12]: marijuana system.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I knew that I was probably the only
person with the knowledge and resources
[SPEAKER_12]: and access in order to do something in
order to help so many people that needed
[SPEAKER_12]: it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I created the Alaska Cannabis Club
while still working as a reporter and
[SPEAKER_12]: decided I would build the club up and step
away from my career as a journalist.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I decided to do so in a public manner.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had one of the club's youngest
patients, his name is Solomon,
[SPEAKER_12]: and he was battling testicular cancer.
[SPEAKER_12]: He agreed to not disclose the fact that
me, his interviewer, was also the weed
[SPEAKER_12]: lady he was doing the story about.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that pre-tape segment aired.
[SPEAKER_12]: I let the teleprompter run with something
completely different from what I planned
[SPEAKER_12]: on saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just spoke from my heart.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I told everyone that I own the Alaska
Cannabis Club and that I'd be quitting my
[SPEAKER_12]: job to fight for freedom and fairness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And as for this job, well, fuck it,
I quit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that led to more than 100 million
views, countless headlines.
[SPEAKER_12]: We rallied freedom fighters across the
state of Alaska, across the world,
[SPEAKER_12]: really.
[SPEAKER_12]: Across the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: But in Alaska, we got as many people
registered to vote in that short span of
[SPEAKER_12]: time that we had left.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then from there, it was all about
education, education, education.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we crisscrossed the massive state of
Alaska just sharing our own experiences,
[SPEAKER_12]: sharing where we came from, and addressing
real concerns that our nation neighbors
[SPEAKER_12]: had.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that led to the legalization of
marijuana in Alaska on November 4th of
[SPEAKER_12]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you for putting your future
and your career on the line.
[SPEAKER_18]: If that didn't work the way it was
supposed to, you could have really put
[SPEAKER_18]: yourself in a hole.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was going to work, though.
[SPEAKER_18]: It had to.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it just had to.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's an amazing step to make,
an amazing commitment to make.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I became a journalist because I wanted to
make a difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this was an opportunity to make a real
difference.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no difference to be made in
journalism.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we're working toward as an
industry, as a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_12]: community.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is one of those steps in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_18]: I really look forward to the talks.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to stick around.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to record some of it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Richard gave me permission to do some
recording, so I'm going to record you
[SPEAKER_18]: guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I may add some of that into the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: I may do some editing.
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't know what will happen.
[SPEAKER_18]: You had.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me put some of that in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Richard Haynes is organizing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the founder of MD Herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Michelle Ross is co-hosting the event
along with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have several patients coming up to
share their stories, including Richard
[SPEAKER_12]: Haynes, Bobby West, Ashley Weber,
and a few more that will really touch
[SPEAKER_12]: hearts and open minds.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope to get some of that onto the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope it comes out well.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I follow you on every social media
outlet that there is.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're quite popular on the social media.
[SPEAKER_18]: A little while back, the Alaskan Cannabis
Club was rated.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was.
[SPEAKER_18]: Very few minutes after that, you went to
Facebook and posted a video.
[SPEAKER_18]: You seemed calmer in that video than you
do right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: You were like, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_18]: We just got rated.
[SPEAKER_18]: At least we're here again.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: If that's what's happening now,
then people need to know it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If we voted to stop something from
happening and police and the authorities
[SPEAKER_12]: are circumventing the will of the voters,
then everyone needs to know what's
[SPEAKER_12]: happening now so that people can show up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they did show up because of that.
[SPEAKER_18]: How many times has that club been rated?
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been rated twice.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been rated twice.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're pretty much comfortable with the
routine now.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not comfortable.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's a horrible experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: No one should have a gun shoved in their
face because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's absurd.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're not hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to heal everybody.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fact that they felt the need to
send more than a dozen armed officers in
[SPEAKER_12]: SWAT gear into my home to put guns in all
of our faces, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that shows that we're still fighting.
[SPEAKER_18]: You look like a pretty badass criminal.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So threatening.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you're definitely going to be one of
the violent offenders.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I was impressed with how calmly you
went on Facebook just minutes after,
[SPEAKER_18]: and you're like, we just got rated.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was definitely impressed.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that has to be a little bit of reporter
experience.
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm sure that's just your character.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've done a lot of interview questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of want to just have a little bit
of fun.
[SPEAKER_18]: How do you prefer to consume your
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it depends on what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I'm going for a calming effect,
then I like a CBD spray.
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I usually like a... She just sprayed
a couple pumps of CBD spray into her mouth
[SPEAKER_18]: and nobody noticed.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I want to just relax, and chill,
then of course I... Well, yeah,
[SPEAKER_12]: I just like to smoke for the most part.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you do dabs?
[SPEAKER_12]: I do dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course I dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't seen that yet.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll have to take a dab with you
eventually.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've seen you smoke plenty of blunts and
flowers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's blunts that are preferable.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_17]: Smoke what you want.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to, and I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's blunts.
[SPEAKER_18]: No one's going to tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_18]: What's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have a favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_12]: Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_18]: You had no hesitation.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you like the sativa headbust sort of
thing?
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: And everything that it stands for.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every time that I light up, I'm reminded.
[SPEAKER_18]: Reminded of the activists that we should
all be supporting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep on fighting.
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_18]: Every day keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_18]: Never give up.
[SPEAKER_18]: So are you going to be here for the 420
events in Denver during the Cannabis Cup?
[SPEAKER_12]: I was here last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was my first US... That was my first
Cannabis Cup period.
OK.
[SPEAKER_18]: There were way too many people around you
for me to get to you to say hi.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_18]: You were popular that day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was quite an experience and I would
love to do it all again.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're there, we're going to smoke
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_18]: We may do another round two of this
interview.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's plan on it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I was going to make sure that I
let you get all of your plugs in and
[SPEAKER_18]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell everybody how we can find you on
social media and your website.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you can, of course, find me at
CharloGreen.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll contain all the links to my social
media, Facebook, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're constantly working on producing
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll see video from tonight on
CharloGreen.com in just a few days.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can get used to that constant
content.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm always on the road.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're taking cameras along and giving
you guys the opportunity to take in all
[SPEAKER_12]: the information that I am blessed to be
receiving.
[SPEAKER_12]: So CharloGreen.com is one outlet.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, my main project right now is
GoGreen.org.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's green with an E at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all about cultivating diversity,
unity and opportunity in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we're doing is having these sorts
of events, looking for leaders in diverse
[SPEAKER_12]: communities that want to stand up and
champion the movement for the people that
[SPEAKER_12]: they share their own homes with,
their community.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so GoGreen.org.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check it out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you support it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Make sure you follow around all the social
media outlets.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you her assistant?
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that your official title?
Not official title, no.
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you are today.
[SPEAKER_18]: Today, you're going to be her assistant.
[SPEAKER_18]: Her assistant is giving me the it's time
to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to let you go.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for joining me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I look forward to seeing your
presentation.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: See you.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys, I'll be right back to wrap up
the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I feel like that went pretty well.
[SPEAKER_18]: That was my 10 minute interview with
Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you guys enjoyed that as much as I
did.
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to send a huge thank you shout out
to Charlo.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the interview.
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, thank you for treating me like a
VIP for the entire evening.
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, big thanks to Richard from
HerbMD.
[SPEAKER_18]: He gave me permission to record the entire
event.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys, I recorded the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, the sound quality was not
super good.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was not their fault.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was my fault.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just used my Zoom H6 little XY mic.
[SPEAKER_18]: It didn't pick it up real well.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of room noise.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of conversation in the back
of the room.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not going to torture you guys by
making you listen to that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I do recommend that you go to a Denver
patient support group if you ever get the
[SPEAKER_18]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_18]: If there is a medical marijuana support
group in your area, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_18]: that you go to that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Go mingle with the patients.
[SPEAKER_18]: Go hear the testimony of these people
whose lives are being dramatically
[SPEAKER_18]: improved by using medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: Several patients took the stage to speak.
[SPEAKER_18]: And one patient that really stood out in
my mind was a young man who said that he
[SPEAKER_18]: had the opportunity to move to Colorado
and use medical cannabis to feel better.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he feels much better.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now he's able to run.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's able to play.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's able to jump.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's able to be a normal kid with energy.
[SPEAKER_18]: But the only downfall is that now he
doesn't care to do that because all of his
[SPEAKER_18]: friends are in his home state where they
do not allow medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can go to these meetings.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can hear this testimony.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't believe in the power of
medical cannabis, go to one of these
[SPEAKER_18]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hear one of these children talk.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hear some of these adults talk.
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of these people developed these
conditions at adulthood.
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of these people were in car accidents
and developed conditions then.
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of these people were born with
conditions.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go and listen to what these people
say, you will be a believer of medical
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of the people listening to this show
already support cannabis anyway.
[SPEAKER_18]: Preach into the choir, it feels like,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I want to thank everybody for
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: I will be back in another seven days with
another episode, you guys.

[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep going, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: So what we brought you here for is to
actually talk about integrated pest
[SPEAKER_18]: management.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're just running a huge outdoor.
[SPEAKER_18]: You were telling me what you were doing
earlier.
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want to tell me about... You can
start with the posting of the Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: picture and how your friends are... I'm
going to just be real with you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: because people run into problems,
and I ran into some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just kind of go over what
happened to me, what I used as treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we do now is weekly
preventative measures, and we'll kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: start there.
[SPEAKER_18]: So... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: And keep in mind, you guys, this is in a
greenhouse and outdoor setting.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then once he gets through with this,
I will ask questions about indoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, yeah, this is... You can run
this... This is... Everything that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about can be ran in an indoor
environment also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were running in our greenhouses,
transplanting plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually just moved from an indoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were growing in a small warehouse and
then moved everything into our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody out there is familiar with
greenhouse growing, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't something that you can just
fire up, put plants into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, investors don't see it that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business owners don't see it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we introduce plants as fast as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment isn't where it needs to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a lot of stresses that are
going on at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of goes to the first step in
integrative pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a real dumb statement,
but healthy plants are less likely to get
[SPEAKER_01]: sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes complete sense to me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're saying that, I really mean
that if your environment's in good
[SPEAKER_01]: condition and your water's in good
condition and your light is good
[SPEAKER_01]: condition, it's like a report card.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're hitting A's and all of these
things, if one fails, you're still going
[SPEAKER_01]: to average out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we rely on this system to catch us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're half-assing everything,
you're going to run into problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we stepped into this greenhouse,
not fully ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: We half-assed some things and we ran into
some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm human, so we run into
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ran in there, running into some
environmental issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were getting them straightened out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants weren't as healthy as they
should have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil was on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeding schedule, everything was right
where it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But things were lagging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant growth was slowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were having some issues, couldn't
really figure out what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually posted some... I'll let you
guys be the judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on my Instagram picture and see if
you're as smart as these people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see if you can't find the picture that
tipped them off to where I was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: contacted by Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Josh, Kelly, and Sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are my saviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get them on the show,
even if it's through Skype or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just pioneers at what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really helped, influenced the way
that I'm setting my farm up for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they actually contacted me and noticed
that we had some leaf curbs curling,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that they were curling,
some of the discoloration problems that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were having.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through a few other things,
they actually saw the pictures and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey man, you have broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I could cry, they had taken
care of it and sent me over some
[SPEAKER_01]: predatorial mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with that, they actually sent me
a little IPM program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immediately, we were going to implement
these mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I implemented these mites,
this is what we actually did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heat treated the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever heard of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this in your grow room if you
have spider mites also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants can handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours did, and I had to have a lot more
money invested in mine than you do your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can run your grow room at about 120
degrees for about 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants will survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spider mites won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any bugs won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to nuke any beneficials or
anything in there, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilize your room to a greater extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So run it for 45 minutes, coming back off
of that for the next 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No direct sunlight to hit the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: No water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to slowly cool your room back
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it about 15 minutes before you start
introducing light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a lot of research on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this is something that you're
interested in, you can just go on Google
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse heat treatment and then kind of
go those steps.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit them with the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burn those motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hit them with the heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, Dragonfly Earth
Medicine had sent me some beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had predatorial mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually sent me two different packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, I believe it's a Schworsky and
Thripex, I'm probably pronouncing it all
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them can protect against the burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, the Schworsky, I believe it's
called, protects against the russet,
[SPEAKER_01]: the spotted, the brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one, the Schworsky is all spider
mite and the broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thripex is for thrips and whitefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also, these predator mites also
fight some broad mites and they feed off
[SPEAKER_01]: each other because they're carnivorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we introduced them, takes about three
weeks for them to inoculate the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I start, like you guys run out
and you want to start trying this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this doesn't work in a synthetic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only works in an organic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot use, you can't, you certainly
can't use any systemics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, don't go and spray things
that kill mites and put beneficial mites
[SPEAKER_01]: on your plants because that's
counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second thing, don't use synthetic
nutrients because the thing is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is when you use synthetic nutrients,
you're bypassing natural processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're feeding your plant through an IV.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need for microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need for protozoa, nematodes
and anthropods because you're just feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: it straight to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you bypass these natural
processes, what's happening is you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing the plant to build its natural
immune response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can keep it organic and you can
keep this biological system just in check
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole cycle, then when your
plant gets infected, the plant itself can
[SPEAKER_01]: react to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant can fend off spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plant couldn't, then there would
be way more spider mites than there would
[SPEAKER_01]: be marijuana plants, but your plant can
naturally fight off spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that in a synthetic growing
environment, especially indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant has no resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant has, it's a puss, grew up in a
plastic bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and that's kind of the same
thing is that your plant isn't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: build any resistance if you're feeding it
space food the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it needs to digest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to chew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to, you know, work that whole
process out itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's just going to become weak
and decrepit and have no defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at that point, what is your plant
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quick vegetative turnovers,
fast veg times, and high yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all you're focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're focused on increasing leaf
surface area and increasing bud area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not worried about increasing root
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not worried about increasing,
you know, the Bricks County, your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're focusing on the wrong things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you miss these things,
your plant, you know, can't defend itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to, I forgot to mention
that is this is for organic systems only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not running an organic
system, you're going to have to spray
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you keep it completely clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to keep a very clean
environment, but in an outdoor system,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like we're running in a
greenhouse and an outdoor hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: environment where you pull in fresh air,
not through a HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have shutter fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pull through.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was seven degrees this morning,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants are a lot tougher than we
give them credit for.
[SPEAKER_18]: If they're outside plants and they've been
given the bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, even indoors, plants are a lot
tougher than we give them credit for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been growing for millions of years
by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should give them a little bit more
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been fighting for themselves for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of the problems
that modern growers run into are because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the modern methods that they use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's these, you know, in my opinion,
this is, you know, just me speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's these synthetic systems and these
synthetic environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say synthetic environment,
I'm not meaning grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm meaning synthetic pesticides and,
you know, but, you know, with these
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic systems, that's what's creating
this influx, these super hardy spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites, these crazy resistant powdery
mildew strains is because you're creating
[SPEAKER_01]: a feeding, you know, Colorado as a whole
is creating a feeding ground for pests and
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every single dispensary is
spraying the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're spraying neem oil or,
you know, it's a very short list for a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of plants and they're not using
these biological controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't want to run into problems,
kick it, you know, start using organic
[SPEAKER_01]: methods, ASAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you can, these
beneficial insects, they're not something
[SPEAKER_01]: that are hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to your local hydro store,
go to topnotch.com, go to Copert,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to contact Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bug them enough, they'll get them
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can get these mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to spray, you know,
we, you know, for example, we put these
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial mites out, we top dress with
neem and caranja, we top dress with
[SPEAKER_01]: diatomaceous earth, I foliar spray with
natural mystic, which is a Dragonfly earth
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like nettle, thistle,
horsetail, lavender, patchoula,
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: It smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to spray the greenhouse with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, we spray natural mystic,
so, natural mystic, barley, and earthworm
[SPEAKER_01]: cast, or like a barley malted tea,
seed tea, seed sprouted tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so barley, natural mystic,
earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a preventative that we were
foliar spraying with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural mystic, earthworm castings,
and bacillus thurgenus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great for the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wiped out some gnats with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, a lot of these things are
just the same thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just different forms, different
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, on a weekly basis,
we give them a weekly app of natural
[SPEAKER_01]: mystic, Rocky Mount worm castings,
and then sea crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, trace, so trace minerals,
natural mystic, worm castings,
[SPEAKER_01]: weekly basis, you'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That on top of just maintaining a healthy
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, like I was saying,
the key is to just maintain the biological
[SPEAKER_01]: immune response through the entire growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no synthetic nutrients, no pesticides,
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bypassing natural processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put your plant in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that in exclamation points on both
sides of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would have known you were reading
anything if you didn't tell us that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just say it's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went over the beneficials,
psilocystegensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, the big thing with
integrative pest management is maintaining
[SPEAKER_01]: a natural system is going to be looking,
scouting, you know, stay observant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to make, you know, the time when
you notice a bug problem, it's too late.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, stay on top of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look out for yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yellowing leaves, you know, there's a
reason sticky traps are yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugs are attracted to dying leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep all the yellow leaves out of your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a no-till gardener and you are
somebody who top feeds with your leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top dress with, make sure you're top
dressing with Neem and Karaja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you do have beneficial
nematodes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you do treat with the
psilocystegensis every now and then
[SPEAKER_01]: because otherwise you're going to run into
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just need to be a little bit more
educated.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how I got my fungus gnats,
trying to go no till.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I did it before too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is, but you know,
you, you learn these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process and your plan will work
itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll, you'll, you'll end up
with different sprig tails and different,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, soil mites and shredders and
anthropods and it'll balance itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nature does its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, your plants are healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You treat them, you know, you keep doing
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit them with your psilocystegensis,
hit them with some diatomaceous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you're so, my guy is at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't fucking get this through their
heads, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diatomaceous doesn't work when it's
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love of God.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got to be abrasive and rough.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also goes for right after you
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the soil is still wet,
don't put diatomaceous on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a hard time getting these guys to
put diatomaceous out correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to just education is
key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know how to put your pest, you know,
or I say pesticide, but how to put your
[SPEAKER_01]: products out correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, the CDA came by our
farm last week, but nothing on our farm is
[SPEAKER_01]: considered a pesticide or really even a
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, our, diatomaceous earth is
bought as an anti caking agent for animal
[SPEAKER_01]: feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use food grade aloe and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Neem and Karanja is bought from,
you know, natural selects or Rocky Mount
[SPEAKER_01]: worm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's all food grade.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, Jay only uses food grade
material for his worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm only getting food grade material
for the plants.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's good to know the patients are being
taken care of, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So a lot of what you covered, you said
organic only.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you said, if you're doing
synthetic nutrients, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_18]: to spray.
[SPEAKER_18]: So now here's where we're going to have to
talk about that one.
[SPEAKER_18]: The dreaded, I'm going to have to spray.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's say I walk in and I see freaking
spider mites in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, I've got a light infested infestation.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never sprayed anything before.
[SPEAKER_18]: What is something we can spray that's not
going to do too much damage biologically
[SPEAKER_18]: to my planet and also to me when I smoke
it and also not make my concentrates taste
[SPEAKER_18]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, your first go-to would obviously
be the neems.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, then the first thing that
you'd want to do is throw down a nice tee
[SPEAKER_01]: of some neem, Karanja, earthworm castings,
just right drench into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_18]: Into the roots.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, if you don't want to make a
tee, you can top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we ran it at our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, we, and I say neem and Karanja
it's because Karanja is cheaper than neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can cut it 50, 50 and save a good
bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, we cut, yeah, I'd cut those
in, uh, neem oil, wouldn't spray it after
[SPEAKER_01]: veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, uh, essential oils,
you're going to pay a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: money, but SNS does kind of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you've rosemary oil and they'll kill
spider mite eggs on contact and that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: irritate, uh, the spider mites,
pushing back a good bit and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibit their growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essential oils, things like SNS,
I'm not like a huge fan of like ladybug
[SPEAKER_01]: killer, red, Rosenthal zero tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't seen great, two good
results, but SNS I have, it's extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rose 90, you know, it's like 9%
rosemary or 2% rosemary oil or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could make it if you feel like
being a little experimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have cooked some plants before with
essential oils, so they're extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, outside of that, I would go to a
biologicals, you know, would be my next
[SPEAKER_01]: step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I would step into the
predatorial mites, um, ladybugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs don't eat spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladybugs eat larger insects like aphids,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the ladybug larva that eats
the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to bring them in and then give
them enough time to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: lower the lights, light some candles,
play some music, and then have them make
[SPEAKER_01]: babies all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can start implementing that system,
uh, defoliating, taking off the infected
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: People overlook that so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many times I've gone
to an infected garden and seen stippled
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and these things look just fucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, my first question is why are
these leaves still on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the spider mites are still
on your plants, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remove that vegetation unless it's
absolutely needed, you know, and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: learning a lot from plants running on a
larger scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I am plants can take a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need to thin your plan out to
two tops from a fucking 12 foot top five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon, it's going to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if all you're trying to,
so, and that's maybe something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to assess too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you find, you walk into your
garden and you find the spider mite
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, which you, you know, maybe the
first thing that you really need to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: think about what is this plant's
intention?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it getting ready to be flowered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, can I just kill it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you, is it too much right now for,
you know, if perfect world, I would tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you to throw the plant away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you can't, maybe you're too far
in, you've already got too much invested
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I'd say, you know,
neem oils and then the essential oils and
[SPEAKER_01]: the predator, you know, the predatorials
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you notice it's usually too
late unless you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: veg for another four weeks, cut her back,
take clones off of that and inoculate the
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's usually what, what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: If I find something's too out of control,
if I, I do consulting as well.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if I go to someone's grow and I can
see that their mother plan or their veg
[SPEAKER_18]: plan has gotten too far, I just say take
clones, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: We can kill, you know, bugs on clones and
get rid of those big ass plants,
[SPEAKER_18]: less vegetation, like you were saying
around to keep all those bugs around.
[SPEAKER_18]: So custom clones, clean the room,
start fresh.
[SPEAKER_18]: That may be your only option sometimes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, and a lot of people
don't, they don't understand start fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: means get off your ass, scrub your room,
change your filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got pain to film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go and buy some new roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you, you're not, you don't just pull
your plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: These, the spider mites got in there two
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got in there because you didn't
change your clothes and you walked into an
[SPEAKER_01]: effective garden and brought them in,
or somebody, you know, brought them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the second option is they brought
themselves in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, have an agricultural
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked in a cucumber, you know,
grown cucumbers, tomatoes, and
[SPEAKER_01]: bell peppers and a whole bunch of other
things in my own garden.
And I'm, I'm going to keep going.
I'm going to keep farming and I'm going to
keep collecting and getting really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep growing map back to a
cracked seal in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: to where there was a broken, because it
was a glass greenhouse, to a broken pane
[SPEAKER_01]: where weeds had grown through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that the spider mites in the
back corner of your room, maybe it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you might have a draft back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's where your window is and you
put a piece of plywood over it with hand
[SPEAKER_01]: film because you thought that was going to
be enough to cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't weather seal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is, that's how spider mites get
into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, it's an evolutionary thing to want
to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Colorado, when it's four degrees
outside and you have a 90, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 75 degree grow room, that's where I'm
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, fuck your plants.
[SPEAKER_18]: Vacation time in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Go get warm, go snuggle.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I've been doing during this
winter is hiding in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you nailed something, you nailed two
things off the list I had written down
[SPEAKER_18]: there is your environment will contribute
to your bugs heavily.
[SPEAKER_18]: And also you bring those bugs in.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I get to cross off two things on the
list without even asking.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys, if you're going from grow to
grow, you're bringing something back with
[SPEAKER_18]: you every time you come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you really want to,
you can buy a lab coat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I recommend to
all of my growers, every consultation,
[SPEAKER_01]: every, we do it at my, you know,
we'll do it at my work when we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in a, you know, when we get back
into more of an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, get a lab coat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't cost anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order them, get one for your home
grow and put it on every time you go in
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang up on the outside, right by the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right next to your clipboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, buy yourself a grow room,
Tam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't wear that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm saying that the dreadlocks might carry
something in.
[SPEAKER_18]: They might get caught in a fan.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_18]: They get in everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: If I don't keep them up, I have a hat
specifically for the grow and it's a,
[SPEAKER_18]: you can probably collect a quarter gram of
hash off of that thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so sticky from walking through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, but that's the key
though is just the contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as not wearing the hoodie
that you were hiking in, into your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you laugh, but to a lot of people,
it's, they don't think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of the guys in my work
probably go home to their gardens right
[SPEAKER_01]: after my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, do I worry about them bringing things
back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, because you know, they're an
indoor grow, bringing it to an outside
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I, you know, they should be really
fucking worried about bringing something
[SPEAKER_01]: home because if a spider might comes into
my garden, it's not going to like it very
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to jump onto your shirt and try
to come home with you and see what you
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's, you know, everybody's
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next time you go over to your
friend's house and his garden looks a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better than yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, change it before and after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do him a favor too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go, don't be a dick and go visit
your friend's grow after walking in the
[SPEAKER_01]: woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't tell me, don't come to my grow and
be like, Oh, your plants are great.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm fighting spider mites.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't come over.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you got spider mites, stay away from my
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't bring your powdery mildew to my
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, and that's another
thing too, is that the powdery mildews,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not that you said that it's
traded, you know, so frequently back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth and within the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another one that when,
you know, when, when I say kill and start
[SPEAKER_01]: over, I mean, scorched earth, I mean,
burn it down to the ground and build her
[SPEAKER_01]: back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, and honestly, when you,
your grow room should build, be built with
[SPEAKER_01]: that capability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not rebuild your grow room
with either walls that you can clean with
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach or peroxide or whatever cleaning
agent, or maybe it's paying to film,
[SPEAKER_01]: but build it to where you can replace it
in a frequent basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you spray foam insulation,
don't you shitty, you know, stuff wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, you know, and if you can't afford
it, you know, these nicer options,
[SPEAKER_01]: paint a film's not expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you build the room, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know what you're doing and
you're running it 15 times around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, build your rooms
correctly, make sure they're sealed,
[SPEAKER_01]: pay attention to what you're doing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's, that's one of the main keys to
growing is a good room.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it, you only get that one shot to
build it correct before you put your
[SPEAKER_18]: plants in there.
[SPEAKER_18]: So do it right.
[SPEAKER_18]: And like Sean said, try to replace that
room.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you, if you're using Panda film,
that's not going to last forever.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys take it down every like six
months, like every couple of harvests,
[SPEAKER_18]: pull that shit down, clean behind it,
get the shop back out, clean out all the
[SPEAKER_18]: corners behind them where all that dust
built up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many like, especially
home grows I've been to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why people like to build
floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's the weirdest thing to me,
but I don't know how many grow rooms I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been in where people have floors built up,
uh, just a couple of inches or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they'll have pain to film rolled
out on top of concrete for extra
[SPEAKER_01]: reflective.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just creating more space for bugs,
pests, mildew and problems like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less is more in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you can hold temp and you,
you know, don't need to cover your floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, you're growing in your
garage, utilize that concrete floor,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's nice, it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be cleaned easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, drop you some two by fours and
caulk it to the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get some great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, insulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bugs are going to crawl through that,
but just little steps through,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's what's going to prevent,
you know, for you from having a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: What you said, once you see it,
it's probably too late.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something that people are probably
not aware of, especially if you're in
[SPEAKER_18]: flower.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're in flower, you just got to start
pulling off leaves and write it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't tell you, uh, how many times
I've had to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to, it's in spider mites can be
dealt with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be, you can get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to kill your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, but like you said,
if you, if you're getting ready to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and you see stippling, don't
flower, don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because when you find yourself
with that decision of like, Oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: am I going to have to spray in week four
with neem oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to spray in week four
neem oil because you put yourself in that
[SPEAKER_01]: position.
[SPEAKER_18]: Because by week six, you're just going to
have crispy ass leaves and no buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you know, but what was worse is,
or even if you were a week into flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would have been worse reverting back
to veg or, you know, holding onto this
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mite infestation and having to
write it through and potentially losing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's another month of power bills versus
losing your entire harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you got to weigh your
options out and that goes back to really
[SPEAKER_01]: think about your situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these plants for?
[SPEAKER_18]: True that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you growing your own personal medicine
or you got a crop out there that you're
[SPEAKER_18]: trying to make some bank on?
[SPEAKER_18]: You're trying to buy that new car.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it somebody else's money?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's a, that's a stress
that people don't realize exist out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, we, me and you both,
we grow personally and stuff, but we
[SPEAKER_01]: manage other people's gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, they're our gardens,
but it's other people's money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do in that situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do you, as a grower come to
the decision of too cold a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, yeah, I mean, that's the,
that's the daily decisions that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can do it, you can do it at your
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but that's what you really get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, people have to start thinking about
things a lot differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meet a lot of people and it's,
I got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what can you spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what should I have sprayed?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you should be spraying ahead
of time, stay on top of these foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you do compost tea foliar sprays on a
regular basis, along with beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects, mites, nematodes, um,
you know, top dress with diatomaceous
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, neem and caranja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see you having a pest problem,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for in my greenhouse,
uh, you know, like I was saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: we thought that we had a broad mite
infestation actually turned out that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a, another problem was a water issue
because our well had collapsed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had brought water from another well at
a different location, um, and did the very
[SPEAKER_01]: foolish thing of not, uh, fully checking
the water's chemistry before we ran it
[SPEAKER_01]: through an RO, uh, ended up putting high
levels of salt in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm a firm believer that it was the
soil, the environment and the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that natural immune response that
pushed me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, if I was in cocoa grown with
mills and I put that much salt on my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, it would have been over the
instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd been like a pepper spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had been screaming, but, uh,
we wrote it out and, uh, you can go to my
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram, you know, or go to sansaw CBD
Instagram and look at this greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: filled with beautiful greenery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was 3000 square foot of just
canopy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Lush canopy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was checking out your security cameras
earlier and that shit looks good,
[SPEAKER_18]: bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice and organized, super clean.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's another thing you guys,
you don't need shit in your grow room that
[SPEAKER_18]: doesn't need to be in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't keep your, uh, your broom in your
dust pan.
[SPEAKER_18]: Get those out of there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, your gloves, take those out of there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Your hat, take that out.
[SPEAKER_18]: None of that extra crap needs to be in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe the only accessory I see that you
could use in there is a little iPod dock
[SPEAKER_18]: so you could jam some music.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_18]: Get it out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of which, DeWalt makes an amazing
grow room radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, uh, yeah, you go to Lowe's and
they're like 90 bucks, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluetooth and waterproof and kick proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I'm punting my shit across the
room all the time, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: They, yeah, they, the little, uh,
the little Bluetooth speaker at the grow
[SPEAKER_18]: definitely gets abused.
[SPEAKER_18]: It falls off the table.
[SPEAKER_18]: It gets shit spilled on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: DeWalt that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys, big shout out to Lowe's and
DeWalt for their iPod dock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the little things in life,
uh, you know, make yourself comfortable in
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are only going to be as happy
as you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're misery, you know, if you go into
your grow room and you're looking at it as
[SPEAKER_01]: work and you're, and you think of it as I
got to get in here, I got to check these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and I got to hurry up and water so
I can get out of here and I can go and do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop and quit growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you're going to run into
these, you're going to miss the stippling,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause you're not going to have
stippling if you're staying on top of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're checking your environment on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that there's no air leaks or,
you know, ventilation issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're staying on top of your
maintenance and you're pulling your yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and you're cleaning up the inside
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got the, you know, airflow and
you don't have to worry about the mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met with the guy today, uh, was telling
me that, uh, one of their greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is February 3rd in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, it was four degrees with like
0% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these motherfuckers got powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were growing with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't clean their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was operator air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not plant air, you know,
these, and that's something that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: blame yourself and don't blame other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's really not the way to view a
pest problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you should always view it as what can
you do to improve it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your buddy gives you spider mites,
don't punch him in the face cause he's
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with the problems too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but now, you know, if honestly
though, if you get spider mites from your
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy, then you're kind of a dumb ass for
bringing a plant in without checking it
[SPEAKER_01]: for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to you just being
educated enough to identify what stippling
[SPEAKER_01]: is to know what spider, my eggs look like
to know how to use a magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, there's so much information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when me and you were learning,
we had to buy books, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember going to Barnes and Nobles,
like trying to buy, you know, books about
[SPEAKER_01]: growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a difficult experience to ask
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays I can go to 50 different
webs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can Google everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's ruined.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can listen to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can drive down the street and absorb
massive information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing is just, I don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be running into these
problems with all of this information
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resources are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Dragon fly earth medicine,
Rocky mountain earthworm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys come through for me time and
time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Jace castings, not just as castings,
but a aloe, cocoa, sea crap, OG bio are,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, earth kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This everything that we can source through
him, uh, neem Karanja kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always hooking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, dragon fly the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, you know, the same thing,
follow us on our farm, sansal CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: me at King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm not afraid to tell you,
I got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll post it if I get powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we were dealing with algae
blooms on our root rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had algae growing on route,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because the temperature fluctuation
are air temp was staying warm enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the cube temp was dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, they don't make thermometers to
check cube temp, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we were basically keeping the cubes too
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had, uh, our, so when we cloned,
we'll do like, uh, aloe, cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I'm sorry, aloe, pro tech and full
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll usually follow your spray
with like a C crop or a compost tee,
[SPEAKER_01]: but basically we had some nutrient content
and the plants wouldn't take it because
[SPEAKER_01]: roots never developed because it was too
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants didn't die, but, uh,
you know, there was nutrient content,
[SPEAKER_01]: excess sunlight, algae bloom, you know,
but yeah, you just got to live and you
[SPEAKER_01]: learn, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like you had a little pond happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, now we're running easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but indoors in micro room at
three, you know, anywhere that else that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've run it, we do the same cloning
method over and over again, hitting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 90%, you know, clone rates,
bringing them into this greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I have, I have clones that aren't
dead, aren't rooted, still green and lush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were taken almost a month ago.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I haven't thrown them is
because I'm really anxious to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are going to live or die.
Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got plants like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken clones off of from like clones
that I took with, you know, I took that
[SPEAKER_01]: clone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, you know, roll with the punches,
you know, information is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, preventative is key or preventative is
key and information is a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preventative is know what you're doing and
don't, don't go and concede it and cocky
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know what you're doing,
but really do your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, spend some time, you know,
looking at what spider mites looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hear that your friend has spider
mites, um, go and for the love of God,
[SPEAKER_01]: find an old t-shirt or something,
but volunteer to go over to his house with
[SPEAKER_01]: the microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look and see what the spider mite damage
looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're not going to know unless you
look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, but that's what I think is so
important is the education.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can become familiar with
stippling, you can become familiar with a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus, you know, the difference between a
fungus net and a flying root aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can become familiar with the trip
or a white fly, you know, then people,
[SPEAKER_01]: these small time guys aren't familiar with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, me and you run into it
because we're growing hundreds and
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, when you're in your home,
grow and you run into these problems and
[SPEAKER_01]: you will, you're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens, but you stop, you know,
evaluate the situation and don't panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't run down to the grow store
and buy a chemical and spray your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never used a synthetic,
you know, nutrient, if you haven't,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I mean, even if you have, so if,
as long as you haven't sprayed the
[SPEAKER_01]: systemics is really the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you're in veg and you hit it with
some advanced newts or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, stop, go and hit it with the
compost tea, top dress with some earthworm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, try to kickstart that biological
system, implement some beneficials,
[SPEAKER_01]: start foliar spraying, and then just ride
it out like nature intended.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they won't want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get mad.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants will eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs will leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll jump on your buddies and go into
their house.
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll run out of the bottom of the pots
like, no.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't think I would be as experienced
of a gardener and in the position I am in
[SPEAKER_18]: if I did not fuck up a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how I learned the most.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's how humans learn the most
is by making huge mistakes.
[SPEAKER_18]: The more mistakes we make, the more we're
able to learn.
[SPEAKER_18]: So accept your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys, when you see some bugs in there,
it's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_18]: You didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You didn't cause that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Learn from it.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we're trying to say here.
[SPEAKER_18]: Learn from it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Admit it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, you're going to have to admit you got
something.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Share it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys might all learn something.
[SPEAKER_18]: You might be able to come on a podcast and
talk about it one day.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been gone for almost an hour here,
but dude, thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got anything else you want to say
while I got you here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, I just really, uh, yeah,

we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really trying to lead by example
here in Colorado with this whole CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: movement.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're definitely, uh, making me feel like
I'm not working hard enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe come back and we can just talk about
this whole CBD gig and they express a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more on what we got going on
out there.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd love to hear more about that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure the listeners would love it.

up.

[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever you're doing, I hope you're
getting ripped with me.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sitting here smoking out of the Hitman
short stack with the email attached to it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Big shout out to our friends at Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_18]: This short stack has become my new rig.
[SPEAKER_18]: I really love the Hitman short stack with
the email on it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anytime I go somewhere else and try to
take dabs, I'm like, I miss the short
[SPEAKER_18]: stack.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go get the short stack and hit that.

festival called Chalice.
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to go.

[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I will see you there.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's enough advertising for today,

[SPEAKER_18]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_18]: El Diablo tried to make a contribution to
my PayPal page, on my podcast page,
[SPEAKER_18]: on my website.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a lot of words right there.
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, we talked a little bit
about this last night.
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week, my PayPal account was
suspended.
[SPEAKER_18]: At this time, my PayPal account has been
deleted.
[SPEAKER_18]: I do no longer have a PayPal account
associated to the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_18]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: I will find another way to accept your
contributions in the near future.
[SPEAKER_18]: Huge shout out to El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_18]: He sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_18]: He said, hey dude, your PayPal thing is
broken on your website.
[SPEAKER_18]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave him some guidance on how to get a
contribution my way and he definitely came
[SPEAKER_18]: through.
[SPEAKER_18]: Huge shout out to El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching my Periscope videos.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for listening to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you for being my Facebook
friend.
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of my friends, I need to give a
huge shout out to Clark.
[SPEAKER_18]: What up, Clark?
[SPEAKER_18]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_18]: We need you back.
[SPEAKER_18]: Since I'm giving a shout out to Clark,
I want to give a huge shout out to Louie,
[SPEAKER_18]: John Randall Jr., Lewis, Haley,
Damsel, Joe, Amy, and an extra fat high
[SPEAKER_18]: five and a Rasta Fismo up to my boy,
John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_18]: That is most of the crew at Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a couple other folks that you
guys know you're included in that,
[SPEAKER_18]: but I cannot say your name on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: You two assholes know who you are.
[SPEAKER_18]: Big shout out, much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been working at Green and Healthy
Wellness for several months now.
[SPEAKER_18]: I got a crop in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been flowered out.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is harvest time.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have been trimming our asses off.
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of the folks I just listened have had
scissors going constantly.
[SPEAKER_18]: Their thumbs are going numb.
[SPEAKER_18]: Their eyes are going crossed.
[SPEAKER_18]: Their necks are sore.
[SPEAKER_18]: They've been trimming their hearts out.
[SPEAKER_18]: But what that means is that by the time
this podcast comes out, you will be able
[SPEAKER_18]: to go to Green and Healthy Wellness in
Colorado Springs and you will be able to
[SPEAKER_18]: pick up flowers grown by Rasta Jeff and
trimmed by my trim crew.
[SPEAKER_18]: So drop in, tell them I told you.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a medical marijuana only facility.
[SPEAKER_18]: The city of Colorado Springs does not
offer any recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's at 430 West Colorado.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bring your purple card.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bring your ID.
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_18]: We would love to see you.
[SPEAKER_18]: When you're there, make sure you check out
some of this Cactus Cooler Live Resin or
[SPEAKER_18]: some of this G-Funk OG Live Resin.
[SPEAKER_18]: That is some of my favorite shit I have
smoked in a really long time.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So a big shout out to the crew.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shout out to El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's brag a little bit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: My friend's at Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_18]: A long time ago, my friend, I don't even
know if I should say his name.
[SPEAKER_18]: My friend was the owner of Kind Love and
he received some seeds for me as a gift.
[SPEAKER_18]: This was years ago.
[SPEAKER_18]: He sprouted those seeds.
[SPEAKER_18]: He did a little phenohunting and
eventually one of those phenotypes ended
[SPEAKER_18]: up in the garden at Kind Love and it was a
lemon Jeffrey phenotype from seed and it
[SPEAKER_18]: was recently tested by a lab at 30% THCA.
[SPEAKER_18]: So, iRegenetics is now officially in the
30% club.
[SPEAKER_18]: I did not grow it, but it is a strain that
I bred.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that counts.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm in the club.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kind of proud of that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Big shout out to our friends at Kind Love
Cultivation and also a big shout out to my
[SPEAKER_18]: buddy Sackmas Deflex on Instagram for
sending me the information.
[SPEAKER_18]: You might remember a couple of weeks ago,
we talked about a product called Guardian
[SPEAKER_18]: Mite Spray.
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a product that was very popular
and very successful in the commercial
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis production world.
[SPEAKER_18]: This stuff was knocking out any pest
problems that may arise, but one day it
[SPEAKER_18]: was discovered that there was a chemical
or a product inside of that bottle that
[SPEAKER_18]: was not listed on the label and said
product has been banned from cannabis
[SPEAKER_18]: cultivation in the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_18]: These people put this product on their
gardens thinking it was safe and then it
[SPEAKER_18]: was found out that their garden is no
longer organic because they used Guardian.
[SPEAKER_18]: I made it clear on this podcast that the
folks from Guardian could contact me if
[SPEAKER_18]: they had anything to say.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a couple of weeks and I have not
heard anything from Guardian at this time.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you work for Guardian, if you know
somebody that works for Guardian,
[SPEAKER_18]: if you represent Guardian, if you know
something about Guardian and you'd like to
[SPEAKER_18]: tell me, you can contact me.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd love to get you set up on the podcast
and you can tell the world what went on
[SPEAKER_18]: with your product.
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be great.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can call me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can go to you.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can come to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll put you on the air and let your
voice be heard.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you guys, I want to get to some reviews
on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to read some reviews and then
after that, we will read some emails.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually going to the iTunes store
right now to open up the tab so that I can
[SPEAKER_18]: read you some comments.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to take a dab while this pulls
up and we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, you guys, I'm going to read
some comments.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we'll work our way through some
emails, which will kind of work us into a
[SPEAKER_18]: short grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get to the first comment.
[SPEAKER_18]: This comment was sent to us by our friend
Tom's Astro blog and it was sent December
[SPEAKER_18]: 10th, 2015 and it says, Tom,
[SPEAKER_18]: does that mean that the committee writing
the bills are listening to the Grow From
[SPEAKER_18]: Your Heart podcast?
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be really great to hear.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you're contributing to getting
those bills written and make sure that
[SPEAKER_18]: when you write the bills, you include
somewhere to consume the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we messed up on in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got the seed to sale thing figured
out.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got a nice regulation system set up.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got a nice production system set up.
[SPEAKER_18]: The thing we messed up on here in
Colorado, people can come from out of
[SPEAKER_18]: state and they can buy cannabis,
but there's nowhere for them to safely or
[SPEAKER_18]: legally consume that product.
[SPEAKER_18]: So my recommendation, when you're writing
those rules, make it legal to open a
[SPEAKER_18]: social smoke club.
[SPEAKER_18]: We need places like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: We need places like the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shout out to the Canna Canyon in Colorado
Springs, my favorite social smoke club.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a members only club.
[SPEAKER_18]: You pay a small fee, you sign up,
you prove that you're old enough and you
[SPEAKER_18]: can go in and you can hang out and you can
socialize and take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can smoke out.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to do another podcast from
there.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've done a show from there before.
[SPEAKER_18]: We need places like that for members of
this community to congregate and hang out
[SPEAKER_18]: and teach each other things.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have bars where people can go get shit
face drunk and get in fights and sorry,
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to judge the people that
drink alcohol, but you're able to do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can go out in public, you can get shit
face drunk and it's available on every
[SPEAKER_18]: corner in every city, but there is nowhere
for us to safely and legally consume the
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis we can purchase.
[SPEAKER_18]: So my advice to you in Vermont is to make
sure there is somewhere you can smoke the
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis that people are allowed to buy.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Tom's Astro Blog, huge thanks for the
email and also huge thanks for the
[SPEAKER_18]: five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys, every comment and every rating
that the Grow From Your Heart podcast has
[SPEAKER_18]: received has a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I thank you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to move to the next comment.
[SPEAKER_18]: The headline says, Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_18]: They gave me a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_18]: This was left by MrJones617 on January 4th
and it says, this man is great.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish he was my next door neighbor so he
could teach me how to grow.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bro, if I was your next door neighbor,
I'd teach you a lot more than how to grow.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd teach you how to take fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd teach you how to carb cap.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd be hanging out, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd be talking about your garden.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd be hanging out with me and White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_18]: Find me on Facebook, find me on Instagram,
find me on Twitter, send me some messages
[SPEAKER_18]: and be my friend and it'll turn out to
where we feel like we're neighbors because
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll teach you everything I know.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the message or the comment
MrJones and thanks for the five-star
[SPEAKER_18]: rating.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_18]: The headline is Best Grow Podcast and it's
from RickRatBMX.
[SPEAKER_18]: BMX, do you ride BMX bikes?
[SPEAKER_18]: That'd be really cool if you did.
[SPEAKER_18]: When I was younger, I used to ride
freestyle bikes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a GT Vertigo for a long time and I
had a GT Performer.
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually liked the Vertigo better.
[SPEAKER_18]: My favorite trick was a 360 tail whip.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was a crazy kid.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't ride bikes too well.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I'm like 6'5 and old.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I feel like when I fall down,
it takes me all fucking day to get back
[SPEAKER_18]: up.
[SPEAKER_18]: So no more BMX for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you're out there riding the BMX.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, RickRatBMX's comment says,
the GFYH podcast, excuse me, the GFYH
[SPEAKER_18]: podcast has really helped advance my
career in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: Tips are on point and the extra comedy is
always welcome.
[SPEAKER_18]: RickRatBMX, I'm curious how I helped
advance your career in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_18]: industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you in the legal cannabis industry
now?
[SPEAKER_18]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me know what state you were in,
how you were in the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_18]: industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd like to know how I helped you
advance.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you start off as a trimmer and now
you're a lead cultivator?
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me some info and let me know what I
did for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we will talk about that on an upcoming
podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: And tips are always on point and you enjoy
the extra comedy.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's rad, dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for noticing that I try to keep it
lighthearted.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kind of a silly dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't be too serious.
[SPEAKER_18]: You got to laugh at some shit or you'll
just stress out and die.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thanks for listening to the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm glad I was able to move you in your
career.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_18]: Send me some emails.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me know what I did for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll get you even further.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thanks for the comment, RickRatBMX.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to move to the next comment.
[SPEAKER_18]: It says, fun to listen to and great
information.
[SPEAKER_18]: And this one was from photography by Jay
Young.
[SPEAKER_18]: The comment says, Rasta Jeff is super
knowledgeable on all aspects of growing
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis and the many different aspects of
the Colorado industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: That is a true statement.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't argue that at all.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I didn't realize that I know a
lot of different aspects.
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody pointed that out to me the other
day.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're welcome for me sharing that info
and thanks for the comment.

Incorporated.

[SPEAKER_18]: Accurate.

[SPEAKER_18]: The comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well,
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm glad you recommend the show to people.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope more people are listening.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope more people are growing better
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm truly glad that you and your plants
appreciate the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure that your plants can see a
difference.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure you can see a difference in your
plants, which means it's working,
[SPEAKER_18]: which means you're a good listener.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're learning shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're applying what you're learning and
your plants are showing it to you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_18]: That means you're doing your job as a good
grower.

teacher.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the five-star rating.

we'll talk a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go on to the next comment.
[SPEAKER_18]: This one comes from Floverins.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I said that right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Floverins.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's who you are now.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're Floverins.
[SPEAKER_18]: I got a five-star review.
[SPEAKER_18]: Some cute little emojis.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a tree.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a squinty face.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got the prayer hands.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a kiss.
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a heart and we got some trees.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the comment says, you guys rock.
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_18]: We love your great spirit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy your lessons and wonderful,
entaining hosts.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then it says, I'm a female farmer and I
straight up thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Job bless.
[SPEAKER_18]: Job bless.
[SPEAKER_18]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_18]: Female farmer.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to do a podcast in the very near
future that focuses on females in the
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll have a lovely female farmer on there.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you listen to that one.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for telling me that I rock.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's always great to hear.
[SPEAKER_18]: I try to have a great spirit.
[SPEAKER_18]: I try to be a upbeat kind of dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that the lessons and the other
entertaining hosts keep everybody smiling.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thanks for the compliment and the
comment.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And everyday job bless.
[SPEAKER_18]: Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all the comments we have got.
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank everybody who sent in a
comment.
[SPEAKER_18]: I do truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you'd like me to read one of your
comments on a future episode, all you have
[SPEAKER_18]: to do is go to iTunes, go to the iTunes
store, search for Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_18]: It will pop up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Find ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then just go to the top.
[SPEAKER_18]: It says customer ratings.
[SPEAKER_18]: It says right there, click to rate.
[SPEAKER_18]: Just give it a five star.
[SPEAKER_18]: Click right there.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it says write a review.
[SPEAKER_18]: You just click right there and you just
type in some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell me what you really think.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I will read your comment on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, you guys, I feel like I'm
talking really fast.
[SPEAKER_18]: So to remedy that, I'm going to take a
break.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_18]: When I get back, we're going to read some
emails, which will lead us into some grow
[SPEAKER_18]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang tight while I take a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, everybody, we are back.
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I'm mostly back.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just took a huge dab of G-Funk OG.
[SPEAKER_18]: I took the dab of G-Funk OG Live Resin and
I dunked it into some Super Lemon Haze
[SPEAKER_18]: from The Clear.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you ever get the opportunity to dunk
your dab into The Clear, I highly
[SPEAKER_18]: recommend you do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Big shout out to my friends at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_18]: Big huge shout out to my friends at The
Clear.
[SPEAKER_18]: And also shout out to my friend who helped
me out with The Clear Concentrate that is
[SPEAKER_18]: straight from California.
[SPEAKER_18]: It is super tasty.
[SPEAKER_18]: I am impressed.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's get down to some emails,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: This email was sent to me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you've got an email you'd like to send
to me, please do it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I may read it on the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: This guy got smart.
[SPEAKER_18]: He wants some grow advice on a strain that
I bred.
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead of sending it to the iReadGenetics
email account, which gets so many emails
[SPEAKER_18]: every day, this guy snuck in and he got it
to the growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[SPEAKER_18]: email address.
[SPEAKER_18]: This one is from... Oh, he didn't sign it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name.
[SPEAKER_18]: I will not use your name unless you tell
me to or something.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just not going to read your name.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, still loving the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a few harvests under my belt and
I'm enjoying this new found passion
[SPEAKER_18]: immensely.
[SPEAKER_18]: I recently bought a pack of Dubwise from
Nature's Green Remedies and was wondering
[SPEAKER_18]: if you had any advice for growing it
indoors.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really looking for a pheno that shows
the super silver haze, but I'm open to
[SPEAKER_18]: suggestions.
[SPEAKER_18]: He goes to list a little bit of his
nutrients and his light.
[SPEAKER_18]: He mentions some other strains that he's
growing, asks if I have experience with
[SPEAKER_18]: those.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I have not grown those particular
strains.
[SPEAKER_18]: He goes on and says, keep up the great
work.
[SPEAKER_18]: You've definitely helped me get better
cleaner medicine to a few people in my
[SPEAKER_18]: area take care.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bro, I'm proud of you for getting cleaner
and better medicine.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_18]: As for Nature's Green Remedies,
they are now known as the Dank Team.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're looking for high quality
feminized or regular cannabis seeds,
[SPEAKER_18]: check out thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure what they've got going on.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes they've got i-regenetics
products in stock.
[SPEAKER_18]: Your main question was, you bought a pack
of Dubwise and you're wondering if I've
[SPEAKER_18]: got any advice for growing that indoors.
[SPEAKER_18]: My first piece of advice will be that
plant will get tall.
[SPEAKER_18]: That shit likes to get tall.
[SPEAKER_18]: Super quickly on you.
[SPEAKER_18]: When you put it into flower, it's going to
double in size.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you've got a three foot tall plant,
when you put it into flower, you're going
[SPEAKER_18]: to have a six foot tall plant be prepared
for that.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you've got short ceilings, maybe flower
early, something I can recommend strongly,
[SPEAKER_18]: that plant loves to be scrogged.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you put out a trellis, if you put out
the screen and you let that plant grow
[SPEAKER_18]: into the screen and then if it tries to
get taller than the screen, you grab a
[SPEAKER_18]: branch and push it back under the screen,
bend it down however you got to do it,
[SPEAKER_18]: weave it all the way through the screen.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you can make that plant six feet wide
and only two feet tall, the plant will
[SPEAKER_18]: love it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It will produce a bunch of arms.
[SPEAKER_18]: It will produce a bunch of little buds for
you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not little buds.
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll produce a bunch of pine cone sized
buds at every bud site for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead of one big glory cola,
you'll have a whole bunch of medium sized
[SPEAKER_18]: pine cone buds.
[SPEAKER_18]: Scrog it out, stretch it out, give it some
space.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't let it get too tall.
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, that fucker likes to get nitrogen
deficient.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you see it yellowing up early in
flower, step up your nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_18]: It can take a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_18]: Both of that plant's parents are heavy
feeders and it will definitely eat up the
[SPEAKER_18]: nitrogen on you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep it short, scrog it, flower early
because it's going to get tall on you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Give it plenty of nitrogen in the early
starts of flower and let it go long
[SPEAKER_18]: enough.
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing people don't like to do with
Dubwise, they don't like to let it go long
[SPEAKER_18]: enough.
[SPEAKER_18]: That plant could probably go, depending on
the phenol you've got, they could go up to
[SPEAKER_18]: 77 days.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you need to take it at 70, go for it,
but see what happens.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's not a big problem with letting
plants go too long.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can really see what happens.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I'm choking off the dab I took just
a minute ago, but I'm recovering.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_18]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if you want me to say your
name on the air or not, so I'm not going
[SPEAKER_18]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_18]: Big shout out, big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope I answered your questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check out TheDankTeam.com when you need
more beans.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, I'm going to move on to the
next email, you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: This one came from our friend,
Mike O.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mike O has emailed us before.
[SPEAKER_18]: This time he's not as happy as he was in
the past.
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's what Mike O has to say.
[SPEAKER_18]: Love the podcast, but it has sucked
lately.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you have a new gig that keeps you
busy, but if you aren't going to keep up
[SPEAKER_18]: the quality, then maybe take a break.
[SPEAKER_18]: The last few have been lackluster to say
the least.
[SPEAKER_18]: What happened to all the old regulars?
[SPEAKER_18]: White Mike is not around anymore.
[SPEAKER_18]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_18]: Hope you get back to the grow talk soon.
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize if you don't like the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: There was one week when I had a guest
lined up and at the last minute I called
[SPEAKER_18]: my guest.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, you want to come do a show?
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's like, bro, I had to go to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_18]: He had some medical issues.
[SPEAKER_18]: I had the recording gear ready.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was hoping he'd be on the show.
[SPEAKER_18]: I cannot blame it on the dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: He fucking had a medical issue.
[SPEAKER_18]: He had to take off.
[SPEAKER_18]: I had my friends, Carlos and Alan come
over.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that wasn't the most amazing
podcast, but we put out a show for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: We did the best we could with what we had.
[SPEAKER_18]: The next show was Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_18]: That show was fun.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think those are the two shows when he
said they were lackluster because there
[SPEAKER_18]: wasn't much grow info.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just me and my bros hanging out.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's cannabis news, education,
and conversation.
[SPEAKER_18]: Those episodes were conversation,
bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes that shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not every episode is going to be an
encyclopedia of cannabis knowledge.
[SPEAKER_18]: I do hope you keep listening.
[SPEAKER_18]: We've gotten good emails from you before,
so I hope you stick around.
[SPEAKER_18]: You cannot say that the episode with Sean
last time was not loaded with information.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there was your cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_18]: The other two episodes were conversation
and you got plenty of news.
[SPEAKER_18]: The people are bored with the news.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that, but sometimes it's my duty to
bring you the news.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I bring it all to you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe not all of it is your flavor,
but I still hope you listen.
[SPEAKER_18]: What happened to Mike?
[SPEAKER_18]: Mike's got a new child, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mike's got a job and a new baby.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mike doesn't find it a priority.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure that that child and his family
are number one, then the job, and then his
[SPEAKER_18]: life somewhere, and then probably 25th or
30th on the list, I hope, is my podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mike's got a life.
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a busy man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Jesse's fucking busy working.
[SPEAKER_18]: We all have jobs.
[SPEAKER_18]: We all grew.
[SPEAKER_18]: We all got in a podcast and made ourselves
known, and we've expanded.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're all doing our own projects now,
and we're tied up.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I do have a gig that keeps me busy,
but I use a lot of that content and that
[SPEAKER_18]: stuff that I love.
[SPEAKER_18]: I learned at that gig for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is contributing.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's keeping me busy, but it's making the
show have content as well.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mike, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't like the show as well sometimes.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope I didn't lose you as a listener.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, thanks for the letter.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you like it.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're always going to have one negative
email.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to hide it from you or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_18]: That shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_18]: This podcast comes with a totally
different tone.
[SPEAKER_18]: This one says, you're awesome,
help and advice.
[SPEAKER_18]: It says, hey, Jeff, firstly, I want to say
thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for such an awesome podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know your shiz.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he also says, if you're taking
your time to read this, then I greatly
[SPEAKER_18]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_18]: If not, then no sweat.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you're a busy guy.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can relate.
[SPEAKER_18]: He said, I recently found your podcast and
have been listening at work for about two
[SPEAKER_18]: weeks now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bro, do they know you're listening at
work?
[SPEAKER_18]: He also says, going through a lot of your
shows and listening to them by title
[SPEAKER_18]: rather than in order.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've took so much of your advice on board.
[SPEAKER_18]: And made so many notes, but it just
doesn't seem to cut it when compared to
[SPEAKER_18]: direct advice.
[SPEAKER_18]: I found myself researching dozens of new
things, which leads me to more unanswered
[SPEAKER_18]: questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: That statement right there is partly what
inspired me to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: I could probably go to any forum on the
internet that talks about growing
[SPEAKER_18]: cannabis, and I could throw up a random
question, just anything about growing
[SPEAKER_18]: weed, and I'd probably get seven to 10
replies pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would say that 50% of those replies
would be bullshit that would actually
[SPEAKER_18]: cause me more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is the problem with the internet.
[SPEAKER_18]: When you go researching cannabis on the
internet, you do end up in a wormhole or
[SPEAKER_18]: what we like to call the K-hole.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just researching more and more and
more and more.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you have to go debunk the first
thing that you read and go research
[SPEAKER_18]: everything else to make sure it all
matches up.
[SPEAKER_18]: The internet can be a real bitch like
that.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's why I came on with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to make some of those things
clear.
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like I know what I'm talking about
and I try not to give you any advice that
[SPEAKER_18]: would destroy your garden.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I totally understand what you mean
about having to do more research.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me keep reading with your email.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kind of ranty today.
[SPEAKER_18]: It goes on to say, many moons ago,
I grew for a few years and had some
[SPEAKER_18]: awesome results, but now I'm doing it
totally different.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't really remember the important
info.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you're not too busy, I'd like to
tell you my small setup and info and ask
[SPEAKER_18]: you a few questions and see if you can
shine a light on things for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish I had your skillset and know-how.
[SPEAKER_18]: So any advice, tips and recommendations
whatsoever will be implemented and greatly
[SPEAKER_18]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand if you're too busy,
dude, let me know.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_18]: Love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_18]: Kind regards.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not going to say your name because
I don't know if you want me to.
[SPEAKER_18]: My advice would be just what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_18]: When you do go to the internet and you
read some stuff, be careful of what you're
[SPEAKER_18]: reading.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've said this before on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you read something and you think you're
going to do it, go smoke a joint and think
[SPEAKER_18]: about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about what you're going to do to
your crop.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about what that's going to do in
five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about what that's going to do to
your plant when you try to flower it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about the whole cycle of your plant
when you do whatever you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're going to cut something,
you can't uncut it.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're going to feed it something,
you can't un-feed it.
[SPEAKER_18]: So just go smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think seriously.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think seriously about what you're going to
do to your plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't just do something to your plant to
do something.
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a thought out reason.
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a method to your madness.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's probably my first piece of
advice.
[SPEAKER_18]: Research it and have a reason why you're
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about it again.
[SPEAKER_18]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_18]: Think about it again and then try it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you're going to try something new,
maybe don't try it on every plant in the
[SPEAKER_18]: crop.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're going to feed a new nutrient,
if you're going to do a new pruning
[SPEAKER_18]: technique, maybe just pick one plant,
label that one.
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to just put a piece of white duct
tape with a star on it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then in my notes, in my notebook,
I write the plant with the star is the one
[SPEAKER_18]: that I pee in every morning.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you see how it reacts to that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You wait a couple of weeks or depending on
what you do, sometimes you'll know by
[SPEAKER_18]: tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll be like, oh, don't ever do that to
that plant again.
[SPEAKER_18]: It got really mad.
[SPEAKER_18]: But now you've learned something.
[SPEAKER_18]: You've got one fucked up plant,
but you've still got the rest of the crop
[SPEAKER_18]: to recover.
[SPEAKER_18]: That stuff will still be there.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can harvest that.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can keep going.
[SPEAKER_18]: So experiment with one plant at a time.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's some advice I could give you.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you would like to email me the rest of
your setup, send me the size of your
[SPEAKER_18]: setup, what kind of light you're using,
what kind of nutrients you're using,
[SPEAKER_18]: send me that stuff, and I will try to get
you some advice.
[SPEAKER_18]: I will give the advice on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_18]: What you're doing is you're creating
content with me and for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to help me out, and it's
going to help out more listeners.
[SPEAKER_18]: So send me your info.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me know what kind of soil or soil-less
mix or hydro-K you're using.
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me some info to work with.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we will get a podcast out aimed
at you and other folks in your situation.
[SPEAKER_18]: And hopefully, we can get people growing
better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope there was some useful advice in
there.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm in a rambly mood today.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is probably the last email for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_18]: We're getting up on 27 minutes right now.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yo, Jeff, it's your boy from South Florida
again.
[SPEAKER_18]: I emailed you only one time before,
but like I said in that email,
[SPEAKER_18]: I never met you, but I feel I know you,
big dog.
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's a handle to remember me by.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he says his name.
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, anyway, man, I was wondering if
you can explain a few things to me.
[SPEAKER_18]: You can email me back or you can put it on
a future show if you like.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, here it is, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, I wanted to know about salves and
rubs.
[SPEAKER_18]: I get horrible knee leg and right hand
pain.
[SPEAKER_18]: I swear I'm going to have arthritis when I
get older.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm only 31 now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, do they work?
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the best kind?
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have any firsthand experience with
it or do any of your boys?
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the first question.
[SPEAKER_18]: He asked a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: The first question is about salves.
[SPEAKER_18]: He wants to know if they work.
[SPEAKER_18]: Honestly, I was skeptical of the topicals.
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't think they would do anything,
but our good friends at Apothecana gave me
[SPEAKER_18]: a bottle of their Apothecana pain cream.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the red labeled pain-free cream.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I actually gave somebody a back
massage with it because they had a
[SPEAKER_18]: shoulder problem.
[SPEAKER_18]: And as I was rubbing their shoulder,
I noticed that my hands and my fingers
[SPEAKER_18]: were starting to feel fluffy.
[SPEAKER_18]: It felt like I had big padded gloves on.
[SPEAKER_18]: My fingers and my hands were high.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was certainly working on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_18]: The person that I was massaging swore that
it made her shoulder better.
[SPEAKER_18]: My mom works in a cold environment.
[SPEAKER_18]: She works in a freezer area.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I got her some pain cream,
some Mary Jane's pain cream, and she rubs
[SPEAKER_18]: it on.
[SPEAKER_18]: She uses it on her hands and she puts it
on her elbows and knees.
[SPEAKER_18]: And she says it helps her a lot with the
pain from that.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, that stuff does work.
[SPEAKER_18]: As for brands, I would probably recommend
Apothecana over anything else.
[SPEAKER_18]: Second in line would be Mary Jane's pain
cream.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_18]: He asked me another question that I am not
even going to read that part.
[SPEAKER_18]: The answer is hell no.
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what she asked me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then he says, oh, also, dude, you
mentioned that you're going to have our
[SPEAKER_18]: arthritis.
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of that could be treated by your
diet.
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you probably don't want to hear it,
but there are a lot of things that you're
[SPEAKER_18]: eating that are causing inflammation.
[SPEAKER_18]: I would read about what foods that cause
inflammation like gluten, sodas,
[SPEAKER_18]: things like that will cause your
inflammation, which will make your hands
[SPEAKER_18]: hurt more.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe if you cut some of that stuff out,
added a little bit of water to your diet,
[SPEAKER_18]: that'll probably help.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to continue and look for more
questions in your email because it's long.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, also, I wanted to know what are
the best strains for pain, inflammation,
[SPEAKER_18]: and anxiety?
[SPEAKER_18]: Good strains for pain and inflammation or
anything with a lot of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_18]: Strains like Harlequin, strains like
Charlotte's Web, strains like Kush Tonic
[SPEAKER_18]: or Kana Tonic or anything high in CBD will
be very good for your inflammation and
[SPEAKER_18]: your pain, and it will also help with your
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_18]: One of my favorite strains to smoke,
it's a sativa dominant strain,
[SPEAKER_18]: but it makes my anxiety better.
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm nervous about going somewhere,
sometimes I just got to go places I don't
[SPEAKER_18]: want to go and I don't want to talk to
people.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just in that mood.
[SPEAKER_18]: If I smoke some tangy or some jelly bean,
that really puts me in like a social
[SPEAKER_18]: chatty sort of a mood.
[SPEAKER_18]: So something like that would really help
you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to continue reading more parts
of the email because you asked a whole
[SPEAKER_18]: bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: You asked a weird question.
[SPEAKER_18]: It says, does Irene currently have any med
strains?
[SPEAKER_18]: And if so, what do they treat?
[SPEAKER_18]: I think all cannabis grown is a medical
strain.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just marketing is what some people
say.
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a medical strain.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all medicinal.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all got THC.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all got some sort of ratio of
cannabinoids and terpenoids in there.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all medical.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's kind of a strange question.
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it mean, is it sold at a dispensary
or what qualifies a strain as medical?
[SPEAKER_18]: Email me back and tell me what you mean by
that.
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're all medical.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yes, all of my strains are medical or
they're also all recreational.
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything I bred could be used for
recreation or medicine or both.
[SPEAKER_18]: When I smoke, it's a little bit of both,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a 50-50 mix of recreational and
medical.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm smoking because I like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_18]: I partially just like the ritual of
hanging out with my bros and taking some
[SPEAKER_18]: dabs and laughing.
[SPEAKER_18]: I also like getting a nice head high and
being giggly and having a stupid grin on
[SPEAKER_18]: my face.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I also like that when I smoke,
I have pain and I have some issues and
[SPEAKER_18]: those issues go away when I smoke or at
least are alleviated.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a nice mix of recreational and
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_18]: So any plant could be both.
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's get a little more into your
email.
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, I got one last question,
brah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I hear that a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio
strains are good for that.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's referring to the pain,
inflammation, and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, but I guess my question is if I
buy a 10-pack of a strain, and I'm not
[SPEAKER_18]: going to say the name of the strain that
you put in the email because I don't want
[SPEAKER_18]: to include that into our conversation.
[SPEAKER_18]: I says, if I buy a 10-pack of a strain,
let's say I get a 10-pack of non-fem seeds
[SPEAKER_18]: and I pop them all.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's say they all germinate.
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's say they are all different
phenos.
[SPEAKER_18]: Does that ratio of one-to-one change
within the progeny?
[SPEAKER_18]: If so, how do you know what you are
getting exactly?
[SPEAKER_18]: Get my question.
[SPEAKER_18]: Lots of seed banks provide ratios,
but even I know that I'm probably not
[SPEAKER_18]: going to get that same plant in the pick,
but I will get the genes.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he says, sorry for the long ass
email.
[SPEAKER_18]: Much love to you, homie.
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_18]: One of these days, I'm going to go to
Colorado and I'd love to meet you.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he says, no homo.
[SPEAKER_18]: No homo, brah.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd love to meet you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Me too, bro.
[SPEAKER_18]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he says, and do a dab with you,
or maybe not.
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably just burn leaf like usual.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dads are a little scary, especially when
you have panic and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_18]: Bro, I truly appreciate that long ass
email.
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I'm going to answer your last question
there.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you bought a 10-pack of seeds that were
advertised to have a one-to-one THC to CBD
[SPEAKER_18]: ratio, and you were lucky enough to get
all females.
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I don't know about lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd hope for a male in there because I'm a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd want a couple of males to choose from,
hopefully three to pick from.
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you got that pack of 10 females
that you're hoping for, and you flower
[SPEAKER_18]: them out, the only way you're going to
know what type of CBD to THC ratios you
[SPEAKER_18]: actually got are by flowering those
plants, trying and curing the buds and
[SPEAKER_18]: taking that finished product to a testing
facility to test for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the only way you're going to
guarantee what you've got.
[SPEAKER_18]: The best way to do it is to grow them out
and keep the plant that works best for
[SPEAKER_18]: your medicinal needs.
[SPEAKER_18]: That may not be the one-to-one ratio,
but you may find that golden nugget in
[SPEAKER_18]: there that works perfectly for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess to answer your question,
you do have a good chance of getting
[SPEAKER_18]: exactly what's advertised.
[SPEAKER_18]: It depends on how much testing the breeder
did before they released the strains.
[SPEAKER_18]: It also kind of depends on how much
stabilization the breeder did before they
[SPEAKER_18]: released the strains.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes you can make an F1 that comes
out nice and uniform.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes you make an F1 that throws out
phenotypes that are all over the place.
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes that F2 will throw out even more
variation, but that's that F3,
[SPEAKER_18]: you'll start narrowing it down.
[SPEAKER_18]: You start narrowing it down.
[SPEAKER_18]: If the breeder does it right, you should
get what's advertised very regularly,
[SPEAKER_18]: but you'll have to do the phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what you're going to have to do.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't rely too much on the numbers as much
as what it does for you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Grow all the plants, dry them,
cure them, and label them A, B,
[SPEAKER_18]: C, whatever, give them a number,
and then smoke them, and then figure out
[SPEAKER_18]: which one of those you like.
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't let the looks of the plant,
the color of the plant, don't let that be
[SPEAKER_18]: your judge.
[SPEAKER_18]: Let the effects be your judge.
[SPEAKER_18]: You will have a good chance of getting
that one.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm getting off topic, but you will have a
good chance of getting what was
[SPEAKER_18]: advertised, but it's hard to guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It depends on the breeder.
[SPEAKER_18]: It depends on the conditions in your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_18]: Phenotypical expression is very much based
on your grow room.
[SPEAKER_18]: If your room is too humid or too dry or
too hot or too cold, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_18]: get those phenotypes that were advertised
because those were grown under probably
[SPEAKER_18]: perfect conditions if they were done by
professional breeders.
[SPEAKER_18]: They've got very great rooms to grow in,
so they grew that plant to its full
[SPEAKER_18]: potential.
[SPEAKER_18]: They got the phenotypical expression they
were looking for, so you've got to get
[SPEAKER_18]: your room up to par also.
[SPEAKER_18]: The short answer is yes, the different
phenos will possibly carry different
[SPEAKER_18]: ratios of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've seen it very, very widely in F1
hybrids made by friends of mine,
[SPEAKER_18]: but I've seen them stabilize it down to
where we can get quite uniform seeds that
[SPEAKER_18]: are high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the long answer.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish I had a shorter answer for you
because I feel like that one took forever.
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, I definitely appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_18]: You gave me a lot of great content.
[SPEAKER_18]: Shout out to you.

[SPEAKER_18]: I sound like I was talking shit,
but I've got an interview lined up that
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm excited about.
