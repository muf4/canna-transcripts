[SPEAKER_01]: 3, 2, 1, 0, and liftoff!
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit, Prost and Jeff in the house!
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everyone, this is Dan and Brandy,
and you're listening to The Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prost and Jeff, you bad motherfucker!
Oh shit!
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 400, and three of
The Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of pineapple
Fanta live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination of golden pineapple
and jet fuel gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, it is described as tasting
like citrus cleaner, haze, and fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: chews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that, but I would also
say it tastes just like a pineapple Fanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that sweet pineapple citrus
flavor, and it even has a fizzy flavor to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may sound crazy, but when you dab it,
you will agree with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious pineapple
[SPEAKER_00]: Fanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode is

[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself all styled out with the fresh
new Irie Genetics gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's work on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have been following along with
my long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started off by selecting a goal for our
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked on selecting a proper space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built a good grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided if we wanted to grow from seeds
or clones, we acquired seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got them sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are potted into their little
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by this time, all of our seeds and
clones should be about the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got stuff in either a four-inch pot
or a six-inch net pot, and we should have
[SPEAKER_00]: clones or seedlings with just a few sets
of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably four, maybe six inches
tall by now, and that is what I call small
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a podcast about the small
vegetative phase of growing your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the vegetative phase of
growing cannabis is often the most
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked phase of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think they need to invest all of
their time, energy, and money on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to believe that you can't build
a strong building without a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation, and that foundation starts in
the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we get these plants to the
flowering room, we need them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them to be robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them the shape we want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them the structure we want them,
and we need them pest and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main focus during the small vegetative
stage is to develop a strong root system
[SPEAKER_00]: for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get those roots thick and
busting out of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I transplant them into their
forever homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second goal is to keep these plants
pest and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I'm working from seeds,
I'm also paying attention for issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations, problems, whatever a seedling
may show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seedling has a ton of options that can
occur through the entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay special attention to your
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from clones,
you should know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main focus during this small
vegetative phase is developing a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second priority is maintaining clean,
healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any bugs and I don't need any
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my third priority, if I'm growing
from seeds, I want to pay close attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to those seedlings and I want to keep my
eye out for any weird mutations or weird
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if things go right, we are only going
to spend two to four weeks in these small
[SPEAKER_00]: pots in our small veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, this phase is equally
as important as the flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to treat every step of the grow
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an important process, we all want to
focus on that flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get excited around week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get super pumped up at week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week six, you're just ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week seven and eight, you can't wait to
cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week nine, you're in there every single
day taking pictures, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, hoping you can cut them down today
or tomorrow, just trying to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we put that much energy into the
starting phase of our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're not as pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to show for it,
but it is just as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get a little deeper into this
small veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this small veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes it small veg is my plants are
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what makes it veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg is the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are triggered by the light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have enough light, they will not
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we reduce the light to approximately
12 hours on and 12 hours off every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: that triggers our plants to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that the fall is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start doing their end of season
business, which is producing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts that we call buds are the
cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are dried flower tops from a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is induced by changing the light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we manipulate that light cycle,
we are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we are using small pots and have
small plants, once again, we are back to
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about these
light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of options for light
cycles in our veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I have experienced, the most
common and most popular veg light schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: is 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go 24 hours on and 0 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen great success with 2 hours of
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 22 hours on and 2 hours off
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility, in a mother
room, and in a veg room, I am known to do
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 hours on and 4 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I mentioned the 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really close to what nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is the 16 on and 8 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these have their advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they all have their disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the advantage of 24 hours and 0
hours of darkness?
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours of light means your plants are
getting 24 hours of light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually recommend a 24-hour on cycle
only for clones and tiny plants or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have mother plants that if
they get root-bound or if they don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough light or if they don't get the
proper energy, they will decide to
[SPEAKER_00]: auto-flower on you over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep those plants under 24 hours
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does prevent them from flipping
themselves into flower because of another
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, I would not recommend
a 24-hour light cycle unless you are
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting clones or you're trying to re-veg
or perhaps you've got a mother plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: gets temperamental and wants to try to
auto-flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 20 on and 4 off for a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a little bit of dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every living thing likes a little
bit of dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think roots develop in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plants like a little rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that is 4 hours of electricity not
being sucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one light, you're saving a
little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 50 lights, you are saving a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 200 light hours that you are not
running right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 200,000 watt light hours that you
don't have to pay for if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 hours on, 4 hours off is always
great for a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep your mother plants in that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep your small veg in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep your large veg in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, I put the clones in that same
room underneath the T5 light in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just a little bit of light in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really bother the rest of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That T5 doesn't do much in a giant veg
room in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I always like to mention the downside
of what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much of a downside to a 20 on
and 4 off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess really the only downside is that
you are always running lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get 4 hours of darkness compared
to my next method, which is an 18 on and 6
[SPEAKER_00]: hour off everyday cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers prefer this because it is
closer to the natural cycles of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is closer to the natural rhythms of the
sun outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little closer to the natural
circadian rhythm that our plants would be
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to in their normal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just feels a little more natural in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pros to an 18-6 cycle is it feels
pretty natural to you and the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also saves you quite a bit of
electricity having a 6 hour night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 6 hours that you don't have your
lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 6 hours you don't have to cool the
room as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And multiply that by however many lights
you've got and you start saving more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think the plants really enjoy a
nice 6 hour nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a lot of productivity from
that 6 hour nap that the plants get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our next option is a 16 and 8 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very similar to the 18-6,
but some plants will show you some
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants may try to flower under that
16-8 cycle if they get root bound,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they become nutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are any environmental factors
that stress those plants, they may decide
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower on you underneath that 16 and 8
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what part of the globe your
plants originate from, they may have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me explain the critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critical period is the amount of dark
hours a plant needs to induce its
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will flower with a 14 hour
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will flower with a 10 hour
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we go for that 12 on 12 off is
it's right in the middle and it seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: work well with most of the plants that we
have bred for our indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since some plants come from north of
the equator and some plants come from
[SPEAKER_00]: south of the equator, we do have different
flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In tropical areas, those plants can flower
for much longer because they're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get snowed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in those areas, we don't get as
drastic of a day and night cycle change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be as much as one hour
difference between your summer and your
[SPEAKER_00]: winter day period.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other areas, we get winter,
we get snow, we get dumped on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we get long dark periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plants have evolved and adapted and
climatized themselves to those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have bred with those plants and we
have created hybrids and brought them
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, some of our plants will flower
with a 10 hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, some of our plants will flower
with a 12 hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have established that 12 on and 12 off
seems to work really well for most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that we have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to prevent them from flowering early,
we like to use an extended light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we put them on 16 hours on at
a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we know they're not going to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go that 18 hours because why not
give them two more full hours of energy
[SPEAKER_00]: every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one desired nutrient
from our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one desired factor for
growth from our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not give it that extra two hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in my mind, I say why not give it that
full 20 hours every day so that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum growth and give our plants a four
hour nap every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another reason I like the 20 on and
four off is I find that when I move my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into the flowering room and I take
them from a 20 hour day to a 12 hour day,
[SPEAKER_00]: they induce flowering very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other facilities where I'm running
shorter veg periods, I notice they take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little longer for the plants to start
popping up bud set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little preflowers, the little pistols
don't start popping up as early as if I
[SPEAKER_00]: were to run those plants on a long day
cycle and then kick that 12-12 right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the plants go, oh shit,
it is time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really had a reduction in
daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I do 20 on and four off in
my veg and mom area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm running, sometimes I've got
50 or 75 different cultivars in a mom
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've really got to keep things happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that the 20 on and four off
prevents anything from auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it really triggers that
flowering when I put them into the 12-12
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the basic veg schedules I
would recommend 24, 20 and four,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 and six or 16 and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go much lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have the desired robust
vegetative growth that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you may get plants that decide to
flower before you're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we know how long to leave the
light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about what kind of light to
put these plants under.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to throw these small plants
under the Gavita lights right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may crisp them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may roast them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to start my small plants under
smaller lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most situations, I think a T5 would
work for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most commercial environments,
I use the three foot long T5 fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're three feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have eight bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you can fit quite a few small
veg plants under those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I like to set
up a two tiered veg system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a Uline rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put plants on the bottom shelf of that
Uline rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang a light underneath the top shelf to
light those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got that top shelf freed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put plants up there and I hang a light
from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got two layers of plants and I'm
maximizing my space by using a two tiered
[SPEAKER_00]: veg system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a T5 fixture for the plants
on the bottom shelf and then for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants on the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I either use a Gavita or a metal halide,
either somewhere between a four and a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt, depending on my space,
depending on my environment, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how far from those plants I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those small veg plants start off on
the bottom shelf under the T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as I transplant, I move them up to
the top shelf and they go underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those are Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends again on my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I really find the T5s to be cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're efficient and I think they
do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to invest a little more money
on a better light, I have seen great
[SPEAKER_00]: success vegging underneath LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small plants really love LED lights and
also those LEDs don't produce much heat
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't use a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a little pricey upfront,
but I think they are worth the money if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a quality LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't have much experience
with LED lighting, but I have seen great
[SPEAKER_00]: things from LED lights in small veg,
in large veg and through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing about an LED in
veg is the spectrum and that's also
[SPEAKER_00]: important when it comes to T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up because I overlooked that
part when I was talking about T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any notes on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all coming out of the top of my
head today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me catch myself before I go too
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 lights are commonly available in two
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you will find them in a
3000 Kelvin and a 6400 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your veg phase, I recommend the 6400
Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will put off a more blue light,
which is what we want for the veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on when we move to flower,
we want more of that orange spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you would switch to the
3000 Kelvin T5 bulbs if you were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower under them, which I do not
recommend, but they are great for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spectrum is very important and I almost
overlooked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were selecting your T5 bulbs,
make sure that you get the 6400 Kelvin
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what I would recommend for your
veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend the bluer or whiter
spectrum lights when it comes to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the new LEDs give you the option
to turn on certain boards and turn off
[SPEAKER_00]: certain boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are vegging, you want more of the
blue and whiter spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, once we turn to flower,
that's when we want those orange and red
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're in veg, whatever kind of
light you're using, focus more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: white or blue spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got another option for lighting
that I can recommend, but I would only
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest this for a very small scale grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for one or two very small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for a cabinet grow or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an effective grow light in a
pinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen a lot of folks build a small
grow cabinet with a compact fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those CFLs, they put off barely any heat
and they use barely any electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get enough of them around
your plant to feel like you're giving it
[SPEAKER_00]: enough light, the plant will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect huge growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect robust plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect a large harvest, but you can
make a plant grow with a compact
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the more light the better,
but some people are very limited in space
[SPEAKER_00]: and power and some people only want a
small grow for a small personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a compact fluorescent light may work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would always be my very last option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a big boy light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are familiar with growing
under high intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to flower under
an HID light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are careful to not roast the plants,
a metal halide light will be perfect for
[SPEAKER_00]: your small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a 400, maybe a 600, a thousand,
maybe overkill, unless you keep it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little distance away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a 400 watt light fairly close
to your small plants if you keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a ducted hood and you're
keeping air moving over that lights where
[SPEAKER_00]: none of that heat is making it to your
canopy, you can get that 400 watt light
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly close to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't let that heat roast your plants
and dehydrate your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say maybe keep a 400 watt light 18
to 24 inches away from your small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The T5s, you can get those T5s six to
eight inches away from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the light, we need to go a
little further because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter and more intense and you don't want
to have super hot intense light right in
[SPEAKER_00]: your face all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You survive from the sun and you're happy
with it being real far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the plants and the light and
the sun and yourself having a similar kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need plenty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want anything in the way,
but also you don't want to get barbecued.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put a 400 watt light 18,
24 inches away, a 600, I would probably go
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30 inches away, a thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to be a few feet away
from those small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a 400 watt light and
it's ducted, which means it's got a duct
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off of each end and you're sucking
air through it to move that heat away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that bulb and you've got glass between the
bulb and the canopy, you should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: run a 400 watt light with very minimal
problems if you pay attention to heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: the distance from those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pretty much covers our
lighting options for our small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the temperature and
humidity for these small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, my small plants appear
to be happiest when they are somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think they like it about 75
degrees to 77 degrees is right about the
[SPEAKER_00]: prime spot for small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I see the most growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I see the most production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I see the most root
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I see the happiest plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees,
or if you can dial it in perfectly,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75 to 77 is that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really seem to like it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for that temperature to work
perfectly, you need to dial in your
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature and humidity work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a math equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This creates what is called a vapor
pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to listen to episode 314
and learn about vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's talk about humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small plants would like to be in an
environment with the humidity somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 50 and 70 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that when the humidity is
too low, the plants do not produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no production for the whole day
when the humidity is too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves start to droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't make any progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look as robust as they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no productivity in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also start to develop a woody
texture on the outside of the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage proper humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much humidity on the other hand can
cause similar problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause slow growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can encourage powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep the plants happy by giving
them the proper conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much better do you perform when you
are happy with your conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I made you go do your job, some of you
are going to laugh at me because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I made you go do your job outside in 30
degree weather and shorts and a t-shirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: how happy are you going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put you in shorts and a t-shirt and
put you in a 77 degree room and I dial
[SPEAKER_00]: that humidity back to about 50 percent,
you're going to be completely comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room and you're going to get a lot
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants feel the same about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep them comfortable and we keep
them happy, they're going to produce for
[SPEAKER_00]: us and give us what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't keep them happy, if we don't
treat them properly, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give us shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a struggle the entire
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again for temperature, I want somewhere
between 70 and 80 degrees, right around 75
[SPEAKER_00]: to 77 is that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet spot from what I have experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again with humidity, I like to
stay between 50 and 70 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too low, you start slowing down growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too high, you start slowing down growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I highly recommend you go listen to
episode 314 and learn all about vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, we have talked about
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is going to turn into a
long podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 20 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm going to take a couple of
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be right back and we will talk
about nutrients and feeding our new small
[SPEAKER_00]: veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, while I'm taking a couple of
dabs, I thought it would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to give thanks to people who
have supported the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge thanks to my friend
Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant thanks to Aldridge,
a big giant shout out to Tanner
[SPEAKER_00]: Martinovich and also a big shout out to
Todd Keller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show on Patreon, all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: go to patreon.com slash grow from your
heart and all of the information will be
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very well medicated and I'm ready to
talk more about our small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we were going to jump into
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I want to add to
our grow environment before we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what we are feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add a small fan to our grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ruffle each leaf of our small
plants as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the fan blasting the plants
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the fan making the plants
bend over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a whole lot of fan activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an oscillating fan,
that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on low and just let it breeze
across the canopy of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make the plants more robust
and it's going to make them develop
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the plants do better when we
give them a little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's wind outside, it would get
blown around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that what happens when I push you,
if I shove you a little bit, not super
[SPEAKER_00]: hard, you know, but if I just give you a
little nudge, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural instinct is to spread your feet
further apart to have better balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel like if we blow on a plant,
make it wobble around a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's going to spread its roots a
little bit wider to get better balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will also result in a more robust
stock, which will result in an overall
[SPEAKER_00]: more productive plant when we move that
plant into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give the plants a little bit of
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get wind outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's introduce a little bit of that to
our indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't blast the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some of the leaves closest to that fan
start getting dry or leathery,
[SPEAKER_00]: or crinkly, or they start looking like a
potato chip, they're getting blasted too
[SPEAKER_00]: hard by the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce either the fan speed or the
frequency that they're getting hit by the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting too much air movement and
you're disrupting the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will let you know if they're getting
too much wind, but give them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of airflow and your plants will really be
happy for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like a nice little breeze,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice warm day, nice sunshine on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next best thing that could come
along is just a nice little breeze I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants kind of feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them a nice little breeze and I
think they will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make them stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make them more robust and you'll
give them just some fresh air more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about
nutrients for our small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a supercharged nutrient
regimen for these little plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to shock them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stunt them while they're
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to focus on a balanced diet and I
like to focus, like I keep saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: on root development for these small
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like a light vegetative nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with bottled nutrients,
here are a few things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are working in cocoa or soil or a
soilless mix or hydro, you need to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to whatever product line you
decide to buy and see if they offer a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, a cocoa or a hydro variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients will be chelated differently
and they will be in different ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: because your plants will uptake things
differently in different mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the companies that make nutrients
offer a soil or a hydro option when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to buying their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing in cocoa, I recommend
you get the hydroponic version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product you are buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa is more like hydro than it is like
soil or a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're shopping for nutrients and
you're in cocoa, I would recommend that
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy the bottle that is recommended for
hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're looking at bottled
nutrients, you're going to find three
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers displayed on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the NPK value of that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first number is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells us the ratio of nitrogen in
that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next number will be the amount of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next number will be the amount of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to veg nutrients,
we are looking for a product with a high N
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio and lower P and K numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a lot of phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to focus on that nitrogen for
building strong, robust plants with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a good solid grow base
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about base
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever company you choose to work with,
they probably offer a two or three part
[SPEAKER_00]: base nutrient system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them will have a grow and a
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use the grow for your vegetative stage
and you use the bloom for your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies offer a two part
product, which will be an A and a B grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also offer an A and a B bloom,
but we don't need those, so let's talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about those later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will take your grow A and grow B and
you will mix those into your water to
[SPEAKER_00]: create your vegetative nutrient base
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they sell an A and a B is
because there are things in bottle A and
[SPEAKER_00]: things in bottle B that will bind together
chemically if they are mixed together
[SPEAKER_00]: without being diluted in our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would fill your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally use a five gallon bucket in a
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd fill your five gallon bucket with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would apply the correct amount,
the appropriate amount of veg A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would apply the appropriate
amount of veg B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would continue to add the rest of
the required nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a two part vegetative nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other companies will offer their products
in a different format.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will offer what is called a base and
then they will give you a grow and a bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: to add on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that type of nutrient regimen,
you will use that base product through the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire cycle, through veg and through
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll use that grow additive during
the growth phase and when you switch to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, you'll switch to that flowering
additive and they've just put the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate additives in those bottles to
keep everything running smoothly with that
[SPEAKER_00]: base nutrient in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now whatever brand you choose,
be sure you get the appropriate veg
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a two part, make sure you get the
A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the kind where you have to have a
base and a grow nutrient, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the base and the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get something simple where there's
just a bottle that says veg, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that one strong veg nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we have a good handle on base
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a good base nutrient with a strong
nitrogen value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would recommend you feed those
plants maybe a quarter of the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: strength for the first couple of times you
feed your plants new nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a light feeding and pay close
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down so that you know exactly
what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also write down the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the EC if that is an option for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more notes you take, the more you can
do research to dial in where you went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us consume a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us consume cannabis while we're
working in the gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you say, I wonder what I put in
there and you have no idea where you went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't happen if you take notes and
write things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode on journaling
and I suggest you listen to that one as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a reliable base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've decided how much to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started a quarter strength, maybe work
your way up to a third, maybe a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're definitely not going to need full
strength nutrients for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your nutrient companies will
offer a feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those feeding schedules will have
a small plant recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still recommend you reduce that a little
bit until you see how the plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: With small plants, I always recommend some
sort of mycoproducts, some sort of root
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant products, something to make
those roots go kapow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to avoid recommending specific
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a long list of reliable products
that will work great for your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Mammoth P. I like Plus Life from
Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Recharge from Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Great White Shark and Orca and
MycoChum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a great combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those products are a little
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also recommend a product called
Mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very affordable bag of micro
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are using some sort of
micro product, I think you will see very
[SPEAKER_00]: increased root production compared to if
you did not use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I like the higher end,
fancier, more expensive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't afford that, get what you
can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend a microbe or a myco or
a root inoculant product for your small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will really speed up your production
and I think the plants will really show a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge difference and you will notice it and
it will make you a happier grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a reliable vegetative
nutrient with enough nitrogen in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have decided on a microbe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be enough for our small veg
plants for two to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to add some fulvic acid to
your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like adding some fulvic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes the plants uptake the
nutrients more quickly and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really worth the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a small bottle of fulvic acid will
really improve your nutrient uptake in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got a good solid base
nutrient and you're feeding your roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've added a little fulvic acid that's
increasing the uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants get a little bit bigger,
you may need to introduce some CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to overdose small plants on
CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the young plants really don't
react well to too much CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, basically we've got a veg nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little bit of fulvic acid and
maybe around week three, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: add a dose of CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: This feed should keep our plants super
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important thing we need to think about
is the pH of our feeding solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: For plants this size, I generally
recommend we adjust the pH somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 5.9 and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we adjust the pH after all of
the nutrients have been mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add in the appropriate recommended
amount of each bottle of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you give it a good stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's nice and mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we check the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a solid veg mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a pH adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to water our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend when you water, you saturate
your medium thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drown the plants, but make sure that
all of the soil or cocoa or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: medium you are watering, make sure it is
saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want any dry pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your roots will not grow into dry spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisten all of your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is probably a good time to remind you
guys of episode 337, where I do a lesson
[SPEAKER_00]: on what is called one through five water
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower and you haven't
heard the one through five water tech
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion, I highly recommend you listen
to that episode right after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is episode 337 and it will teach you a
lot about watering your plants correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have appropriately watered our small
plants with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we need to give our plants
nutrients again?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cocoa, I like to feed nutrients to my
plants at every single watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single day, I will feed my plants a
solid base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will add a booster every day and I
will rotate those boosters depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what the plants may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this small veg case, my booster would
be the Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put the base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put the fulvic acid and I would
put the mycos in my nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once a week, I would put that Kalmag
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my booster for these small
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're working in soil or soilless
mix, you don't need to feed nutrients as
[SPEAKER_00]: often because they stick around in the
dirt a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you feed with nutrients
one feed, then water the next feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're feeding with just clean water,
please adjust the pH just like you do when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're mixing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your container with water,
stick your pH meter in there, see what it
[SPEAKER_00]: says, adjust it up or down accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to adjust the pH at every
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend you do one feeding of
nutrients, one watering of pH adjusted
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go back to that basic
nutrient regimen for the next watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small veg plants will need frequent
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them get too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them be overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, check out the one through five
watering tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to pay attention to
is over-nutrienting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we over-fertilizing these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we burning them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the very tips of the leaves start to
look brown or the wrong color or if they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to curl, we are feeding too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaves look pale and yellow,
we are not feeding enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a mixture of those two
symptoms, your pH is probably off.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the very first things I recommended
in these grow lessons was that you buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: book and you read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've already done some
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have looked at some leaf
charts and you know what deficiencies look
[SPEAKER_00]: like so you know what to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what a healthy leaf looks like
and you know what an unhealthy leaf looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like and it's going to pop out in your
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see those leaves doing something
weird, you're going to say, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: what the book said this should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you've gotten the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are showing you that they need
more nutrients, increase your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little more base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't need to increase the
amount of fulvic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to mycos, I have learned
that it is better to feed small amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: more frequently than to try to feed a
whole bunch at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to do any good by pouring
the whole bottle in there at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be more effective to pour the
bottle in there slowly over a course of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if you see a deficiency,
just increase that base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to run into a deficiency
with in small plants is either going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen or Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be your most common
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to those two things and
learn what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next common thing you're going to find
is nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to try to feed too much
to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard somebody say the term moron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to put more on it to make it
grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was hilarious when I heard
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people like that don't be
that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're running a hydroponic
system, if you're in Rockwell cubes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing a top feed, or if you're in
some type of ebb and flow system,
[SPEAKER_00]: your small veg phase will not be nearly as
long as us growing in cocoa or a soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your small veg phase zips right by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the hydrogrows go much more
quickly in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your small veg phase may be only about
a week long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to introduce more
nutrients at a higher rate sooner in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very plant specific and very
strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since the plants grow a little more
quickly, you are going to need more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm going to remind you of in
your hydroponics is to stay on top of your
[SPEAKER_00]: pH and your EC or your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it every single day and adjust as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is going to evaporate from your
hydroponic setup, but the nutrients will
[SPEAKER_00]: not evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your pH and your PPMs are going to
fluctuate during that evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plants are going to consume some
of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water is going to disappear
throughout the day, which is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause changes in your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a hydroponic grower, you need to be on
top of that every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm going to recommend you take
extra notes as a hydrogrower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reactions happen a little more quickly and
the plants are a little more sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're running hydro because you
don't have that big soil life system to
[SPEAKER_00]: work as a buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, boys and girls, I feel like
that is a good talk on small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave these plants in these
pots for two to four weeks, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how quickly they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very environment dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to remind you to do is
spread your small veg plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have them crushed together now
because they're small plants, but as they
[SPEAKER_00]: get larger, make sure you spread them out,
give them more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got them all crushed together,
they're going to grow straight up and get
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them space to branch out,
they will do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you top them, you've got
nice bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I know I didn't talk about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't talk about containers in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered that in the previous
episode, so we were up to speed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave these plants in these
containers for two to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will uppot them into three gallon
or five gallon or perhaps seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you out there are going to
go huge and go into a 20 or an even larger
[SPEAKER_00]: container, but we're going to work on that
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a little time to let these
plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job now is to keep them healthy,
keep them happy, keep them pest and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen free, keep working on those
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any yellow or funky leaves,
make sure you pull that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take good care of your new sweet
little babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they don't have any problems so
that when we transplant them into their
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pots, they're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a fat root system and they
don't go into any shock from a transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just realized that I did not cover any
pest management for our small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have decided on an
integrated pest management system for your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before this point, hopefully that was
part of your planning phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we don't have any pests or
problems on our small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks will choose to apply a
pesticide as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks will wait until they see a
problem to use a pesticide on a plant this
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to wait until I transplant
these into their three gallon pots before
[SPEAKER_00]: I put any pesticides on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in some environments I don't
trust the place and I need to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use something like Evergreen and I
would probably use it around 15 mL per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure to apply it while the
lights were off and I would be sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants were completely dry before I
turn the lights back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably do this approximately
every five to seven days while the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are little if I were in a place that had a
reputation for getting a pest infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like that should keep us
pest free for the first four weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can really start implementing our
integrated pest management once we
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant into those three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I feel like that
is a solid show about small veg.

let me bring up something I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: forgetting to mention on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, Patreon changed the way the
contributors cards are billed.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that process, many contributors
were removed from content creators pages.

[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
buddy, Stabby McStaberson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 369 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the Hela
Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hela Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like to start the show off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of something called
fluffernutter sauce from Contraband
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at a Cut Above in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff has a very unique aroma and
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bust the container open again
just to get a fresh smell to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that dryer sheet sort of smell
that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the concentrates from Contraband
have that dryer sheet turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which turp that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body really likes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got almost a citrus thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you let it sit on the nose for a
minute and you just give it a nice smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it rest, it has a really warm
aroma to it, something warm in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people tell me that my strain
descriptions are completely crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you bought a gram of this and you
cracked it open and gave it a smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would say that is sweet with a hint of
citrus, with a little warmth at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would probably agree with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I always love the high of the
products I buy from Contraband
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always got that nice heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe that sharp dryer sheet
sort of aroma has something to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: head buzz that I get from this
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they always do a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Fluffernutter sauce
from Contraband Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously got me nice and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lot of great information
written down for you in this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but before we get to it, I would like to
give a few people some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with Brett Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant shout out to Brett
Gorman?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout out to Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I totally appreciate that
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a shout out to Sam and Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to become a
patron, you can do so by going to patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: .com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you need will be right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thanks for all the
support, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to do another
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that series, we set a goal for our
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a safe place for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've selected the appropriate equipment
for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also selected the appropriate
nutrients and pest management system for
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have either sprouted seeds or
potted some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this point of our grow,
we have got clones or seedlings in small
[SPEAKER_00]: pots that are probably six to ten inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, and they're developing nice
fat roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we are in these grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, I plan to talk a little
bit more about small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue that conversation
since time has progressed, since we put
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants into the small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to work my way into talking
about micro products and root development
[SPEAKER_00]: and the importance of healthy roots and
the benefits of using a quality micro
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this episode may feel like a
recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it will be a recap, but we will
work our way right into our current state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like it's good to remind
people not everybody listens to every
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to get people up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I move forward, I do need to
correct myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a mistake on the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I was talking about
ideal lighting for our small plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like I completely overlooked
ceramic metal halide lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal halide lighting is a very
viable and useful option for your small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like I left you out by not
mentioning the CMH lighting, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are quality lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recommend new growers to use those
lights for small plants, if that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are affordable, they don't put out a
lot of light, and they don't use a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a ceramic metal halide light is a very
viable option for a small grow for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to step up, move up from
the 315s to the 630s, I've seen great
[SPEAKER_00]: results with those in a flowering room as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let me forget the ceramic metal
halide lighting anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always a viable option in a
cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back on track and talk more
about continuing our small veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what I consider small veg are small
plants, anything basically from a cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: or a seedling that is in a small pot,
maybe like a four inch pot, maybe a six
[SPEAKER_00]: inch net pot, maybe all the way up to an
eight inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our smaller plants that don't have a
super strong, healthy developed root
[SPEAKER_00]: system are plants that are probably only
eight to 10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what I am considering my small
veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now up to this point, we've mainly been
focusing on healthy pest and pathogen free
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you check every day for the
presence of pests or pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even as the plants are small, we still
need to pay close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip a leaf over, see if you see any
weirdness on the bottom of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the tops of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any stippling?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any gooey stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flick some of the plants, flick some of
the containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see anything fly out?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a sign of either fungus gnats or
white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're white, they're white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're black, they're probably fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention for pests in our small
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to take care of them if
we do get them, but we need to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: our problems early so that we can conquer
them before they get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in and check for pests every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to spot it on these
little plants very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start in the center of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will usually start at the whitest point
of one of your biggest leaves and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: look like somebody just took a little drop
of donut powdered sugar and just dropped
[SPEAKER_00]: it right on your leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like some sort of white powdery
water that dried up and just left a little
[SPEAKER_00]: stain right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first indicator of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably happen in a low light
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not getting a lot of light,
but there is a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes it will happen where that
little bit of water just hangs on that one
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf in that one spot and it never quite
goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going to get the PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goal right now is to keep these
plants pest and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep them developing strong,
healthy root systems so that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: strong, healthy plants when it's time to
transplant them and then later move them
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that your plants are starting to grow
and you've spent some time with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably seen what happens when you
over and under water them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably done one or the other,
which has probably caused a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: funky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to pull off all of the
ugly leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got yellowing, crispy leaves,
take those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those yellow leaves are an invitation for
a spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use yellow sticky cards in
the garden to help the pests go to those
[SPEAKER_00]: cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them on the cards and we can tell
that they're there, but the pests love to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to that yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that is a weak leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you're a hungry spider mite and
you see a big, healthy, robust leaf that's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a really thick layer of healthy
vegetation to chew through before you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get some nutrients out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or imagine just a little lower on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a weak leaf that's yellow on
the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a real thin layer and you can
just poke right through it, suck all the
[SPEAKER_00]: juice you want right out of it like a
hungry little vampire bug you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go right to those weak
yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as much work for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get right in there and get what
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spider mites are going right for that
yellow, weak part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pull off all those weak parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull off all the yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the problems are going to
start anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the plant is the weakest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you're pulling off leaves,
you may notice that the couple of branches
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very bottom of your plant are just
weak and shitty and kind of in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a couple of leaves that are
hanging down into the dirt, pick that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that very bottom crap on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time it makes it to flower,
we're going to clean up the bottom eight
[SPEAKER_00]: to 10 inches of that stock anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bottom branches will not even be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you take some of those
little sucker branches off the bottom now,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will encourage growth up to the top of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that stuff on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light's not going to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the problems are going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not cut that stuff right off?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with the way your plants
look without pruning anything off the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, you don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got two or three branches on
the bottom that just aren't growing to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach the rest of the branches,
if they look weak, why not take them off?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that weak shit down there at
the bottom of the plant wasting energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting nutrients, and wasting water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just cut it right off and send that
energy right up to the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as the plants get bigger,
you'll notice they're starting to branch
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottoms of some of the branches,
you may start developing shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those little shoots are weak,
you can pinch those off as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to take off the entire
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just take off the shitty shoots at
the bottom, and you can still leave the
[SPEAKER_00]: ends of those branches, and you can still
have more bud sites and more branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take off too much now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always take off more in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot glue branches back onto the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, the plant grows out of
the top, so the shit you take off the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom will not replace itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're cleaning up the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to grow out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk a little bit about
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend starting off with light
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are showing any yellow or
if they're not growing as quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you would like them to, you may need to
increase the overall amount of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: we are giving the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend starting low and
increasing as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are a little bit pale or
yellowish, if they're not as green as we
[SPEAKER_00]: would hope they would be at this point,
it is probably time to increase our
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it may be time to add some Cal Mag
to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are growing properly,
if they're nice and robust, if they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice root system in this small pot,
I would recommend adding a small dose of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag once a week to your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're feeding your
plants properly, you're giving them a
[SPEAKER_00]: proper amount of nitrogen, you're giving
them the proper amount of Cal Mag,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also giving them some beneficials
for the roots, and you're not seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth you would like to see, I would
suspect that it's probably a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the pH of the solution you are
feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pH is off, your plants won't be
able to uptake nutrients, which means they
[SPEAKER_00]: will not grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have mixed up your nutrients,
put your pH pin in there and see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of that solution is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That solution is before you feed it to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not in the appropriate range,
adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is such an overlooked step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time when people send me
pictures of their plants, they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is wrong with my plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask them, what was the pH of your last
feeding solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what most of their answers are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually tell them, check the pH and
get back to me because I would assume if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not checking the pH, that is
probably the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even bother to check.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know if you've got another
nutritional problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know if you're overfeeding or
underfeeding a specific nutrient if I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what the pH of your solution
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to dial in the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode on the
importance of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these small plants, I really think
they would be happiest with a pH right
[SPEAKER_00]: around 6.1 or 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go 5.8 to 6.3 if you really want
to have a wide range, but I think 6.1 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.2 in cocoa or soilless mix is going to
be ideal for these small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may increase that pH as we go along the
grow process, as we pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and see how they react to certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I think this 6.2 is right
about where we need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got clean, healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have increased our nutrients to
increase our vigor and increase growth
[SPEAKER_00]: speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably time to spread your plants
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're too pressed together,
if they're too crowded, they're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to branch out properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got them crushed in there
real tight, it's time to spread them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like your plants are getting
too tall and too skinny and too stretchy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They either want more light or they are
too close together, which probably just
[SPEAKER_00]: means they want more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got branches pressed together,
if you've got leaves pressed together,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got plants overlapping each
other, if you've got one plant pressed up
[SPEAKER_00]: against the wall, they know they're too
tight together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of branching out, they're
going to go straight up and try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all competing for light space and
you're probably running your small veg
[SPEAKER_00]: under a smaller light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means they're really competing for
that space if we crowd them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them get some light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one desired nutrient
and source of energy for our plants over
[SPEAKER_00]: their entire life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want light more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants think they're going to get
the sun and we brought them indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: wired up little T5 bulbs and we're trying
to make them grow with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spoil them and give them as much of
that T5 lighting as they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them as much space as they can
handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can get maximum performance
from our small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I feel like we have got healthy
plants that are pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably about eight to 10 inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to get nice branching on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've cleaned up those crappy branches on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've pulled off any funky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spread them out so that they're not
too crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are probably going to transplant these
plants into their forever homes within the
[SPEAKER_00]: next week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the next grow lesson
that I provide will be transplanting into
[SPEAKER_00]: our forever homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing we should really focus
on until we transplant is fat root
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my plants to be nearly root bound
in these small pots before I transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have to kind of break that root
ball up at transplant to make it explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds crazy, but if you get that root
ball kind of tight in a small pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we transplant it into the next pot,
it will really take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will really see explosive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a really robust and healthy
plant from the very beginning with a solid
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let these plants grow and get
kind of tight in their pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some roots coming out of the
bottom of your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those roots are nice and white,
that means you are feeding those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: very well, that your plants are very
happy, that they are getting a nice amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of moisture, that they're getting a nice
amount of dry time, that everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: going well inside your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to take a look at your
roots and see what kind of root
[SPEAKER_00]: development you're working with,
don't be afraid to grab a cup or a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: with a plant in it and put your feet
finger over the pot and kind of make a
[SPEAKER_00]: spock hand to where you're spreading your
ring finger and your middle finger apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the stock of the plant right between
those two fingers and then just flip that
[SPEAKER_00]: pot upside down and give it a little bit
of a shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're confident, you can pull that pot
off and you can look directly at the root
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start lifting that pot off and the
dirt starts falling out like crazy and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not compact and pressed together,
push it back in there and just leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are not developed enough to try
this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start lifting that pot off and all
the dirt stays in one piece and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see those roots, you can just lift that
pot right off and you can take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see those roots wrapped around
inside of there and all the dirt and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots are tight into one piece,
that is what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are almost ready for transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to let those get almost root bound
to where the plant is almost filling that
[SPEAKER_00]: container with roots to where it is almost
panicking time to put that into a new pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if we wait that long to put it
into our next pot, we get explosive root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth when we transplant it into the next
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel like we get less transplant
shock and I feel like the plant is more
[SPEAKER_00]: developed and more prepared to go into its
larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are experienced or confident,
grab a plant, flip it upside down and
[SPEAKER_00]: knock the container off of it and see what
comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all the dirt goes flying and the roots
come unraveling and hanging out,
[SPEAKER_00]: just plant that back in there really
carefully and it will be okay if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: careful about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your best not to break any of the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't disturb the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you've got it out, sprinkle a little
bit of root inoculant powder on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle some Plus Life or some Great
White right onto the roots and put it back
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and that inoculant will encourage
those roots to grow even more quickly than
[SPEAKER_00]: they already were.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I'm going to
press pause for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably take a couple of dabs while
I'm at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get back, we will talk more about
developing healthy roots and we will also
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a dab with me and I will be right
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well-medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well-hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we transfer our small plants into
their forever homes, we want to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: thick, healthy white roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a big fat root system so that
we've got a well-established plant to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good micro product will encourage
explosive root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the other
advantages of our mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first obvious advantage is more roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: More roots means our plants can eat more,
which means our plants can drink more,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means our plants will grow more
quickly, which means we will produce more
[SPEAKER_00]: branching, which means we will produce
more buds, which is our main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first benefit, more roots,
which means more productivity overall from
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great function of our beneficial
fungus is they work as a protective layer
[SPEAKER_00]: or a security guard for our root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They protect against pathogen problems and
illness in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a colony of beneficial
fungus gathered around the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything else tries to get near it,
those colonies say, Hey, this is our turf,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fight off any potential pathogens
that want to get to your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our beneficial bacteria work in a
similar function as an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will break down decaying matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will break down nutrients and it will
make it more bioavailable to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plants can take that waste and
actually turn it into food and consume it
[SPEAKER_00]: and use it to its benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are using a micro product,
I don't recommend that you stop using your
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you use them together,
let them team up and create a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: environment in your rhizosphere that will
also create a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have multiple things in there
breaking down the decaying matter that
[SPEAKER_00]: should really encourage a clean,
healthy rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another function of some of our beneficial
bacterias is they aid in the processes
[SPEAKER_00]: that encourage branching and bud set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by introducing these beneficial
bacteria, you may see more branching and
[SPEAKER_00]: you may see more bud sites in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another great thing that these
beneficial bacterias do is they work to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase essential oil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are essential oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential oils are our terpenes and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase the overall production of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase the overall flavor,
aroma and potency of your plants by using
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I try to avoid recommending brand
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several great mycorrhizal
products available at your local grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will list a few products that I have had
great experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I have to recommend Recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recharge made my plants go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the good things about Recharge is
it contains dried molasses, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly feeding the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes do need some sort of fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already got fuel in that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another acceptable mycoproduct is called
Extreme Mycos, and they spell mycos with a
[SPEAKER_00]: K.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy a very expensive
micro product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something that's affordable,
if you're just going to try it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: Extreme Mycos is probably one of the most
affordable micro products on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a liquid micro product,
you can get HydroGuard from Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Great White.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great White is a powdered micro product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the powders because you can
sprinkle them directly onto the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about that when
we get to the transplanting episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during transplant, I like to sprinkle
the powders directly onto the roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: into the hole where I'm transplanting my
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also transplant the roots and into the
hole where I'm transplanting my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just easier to keep them in a liquid
solution without that fungus in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great White also makes a product called
MycoChom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke earlier that I like Recharge
because it's got a product that feeds
[SPEAKER_00]: their beneficials that comes in one
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks that make Great White and Orca
have put out a product called MycoChom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product will feed your beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also contains other things that will
encourage root growth and healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks that make Great White and Orca
and MycoChom also make a time release
[SPEAKER_00]: grant annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm working in a large container,
I like to start that pot with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time release granules already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mix up a large batch of soil with my
amendments, with my perlite, with my
[SPEAKER_00]: persilite, and then I will just pour a big
bag of the dried granules from Great White
[SPEAKER_00]: right across the top of that, mix it right
in, put that into the pot and plant right
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like giving them plenty of that
beneficial bacteria really reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant shock and it really encourages
explosive root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another powdered root inoculant I can
recommend is the Plus Life from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the commercial grows in Colorado
are running Veg Bloom, so I would
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage them just to add the Plus Life
product right along the Veg Bloom base
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had great success using the Veg
Bloom product line and adding the Plus
[SPEAKER_00]: Life root inoculant powder along with that
mix and I've used that in grows of all
[SPEAKER_00]: different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it in four light grows and I've
used it in four hundred light grows and I
[SPEAKER_00]: like the way it works in all conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I've got one more product to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great liquid microbe product is
Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Pea is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about Mammoth Pea
is it is highly concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing is you do not have to
add anything to feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Pea uses microbes that can sustain
themselves off of the carbon in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown happening within the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a list of great microbe
products I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vary in application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vary in amount of microbes per
container and they are going to vary
[SPEAKER_00]: widely in prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what works best for you and your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are going to enjoy the dried
powdered forms more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are going to like the liquid
forms more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you simply cannot get the
overpriced expensive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you will only buy the overpriced
expensive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got their style.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommended several products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used each of those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had great experience with those
products and I feel like I can recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: those products to you with confidence that
they are going to work in your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: under just about any type of conditions or
any type of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that you may need to feed
your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that some of the
microbes do contain other additives that
[SPEAKER_00]: will feed themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will still encourage you to feed the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes want to eat carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants want to eat carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add a little bit of carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbohydrates will give your plants
energy and the carbohydrates will feed
[SPEAKER_00]: your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overdose the carbs trying to feed
them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally suggest starting off with half
of the recommended dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a bottle of a carbohydrate
product and it says feed 40, I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you start off with 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants seem happy, you don't need
to increase the dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, you can increase the
dosage until you see the plants react
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a lot of growers like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push it as hard as we can and then back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you learn the limits of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a newer grower, if you're
not super experienced, just feed it half
[SPEAKER_00]: of that recommended dosage and the plants
will be receiving that nutrition even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't see anything happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful overdoing it with the
carbohydrate product late in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: because it will make your buds burn like a
rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just turn into a charcoal
briquette and they won't burn very well if
[SPEAKER_00]: you overdo it with the molasses or a
carbohydrate product late in bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier I mentioned mycochome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a quality product,
to feed your microbes and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: microbe growth and encourage root growth
and overall plant health, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: mycochome from the same folks that make
the Great White product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes to feeding your
microbes, I recommend more frequent
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first time I introduce microbes to
my feeding regimen, I usually give it what
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottle says.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the container says one gram or 25
milliliters, I will add that to my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution and I will water that
right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to get a good start of the
colonization of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to give it a good head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them in there and get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my subsequent waterings, I will
probably give it half of the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those products usually say to water it
in once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of doing it once a week,
I'll reduce the dosage to half and water
[SPEAKER_00]: it every time I water for a couple of
weeks to build a nice solid colony of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungus in my rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after I transplant into my three
gallon pots and I get the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: cranking and I've got a nice fat root ball
in that pot, I will start reducing my
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency of inoculant feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, when I'm in flower,
I generally feed plus life once a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's enough through the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I've got the roots nice and healthy
and everything is developed, I will
[SPEAKER_00]: generally use the plus life to keep
problems away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the root zone nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice enzymatic product and a nice
mycorrhizal product again will work to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the roots clean and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's healthy and happy and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just continue the once a week feeding
just to keep everybody clean and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like plant probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like giving probiotics to a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take probiotics for your gut
health, it just has a good, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: good gut biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making a good gut biome for our
plants by feeding them probiotics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are actually mycorrhizal fungus when
it comes to the plant world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing to talk about and
then we're going to start wrapping up this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are listening or reading or
learning about mycorrhizal fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will hear three words quite frequently
that basically mean the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will hear the word inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will hear the word vaccinated and you
will also hear the word infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: These words all basically mean that the
root zone shows the presence of a
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inoculate our root zone with a fungus
by adding it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now inoculated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that takes hold, it is basically
vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it travels across the root zone,
it is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a positive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they sound like scary words,
but in this situation, all three of those
[SPEAKER_00]: words are positive things that we want
happening within our rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you hear the word inoculated,
vaccinated or infected, keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just means basically the presence of
mycorrhizal fungus within our root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my talk about continuing small
healthy veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also my lesson on mycorrhizal
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in learning a lot
more about mycorrhizal fungi, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend a podcast called Cannabis
Cultivation and Sciences by Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad recently had Jim Egan on the show and
they do a deep dive into mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus and I highly recommend the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already planned this episode to come
out this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was writing this episode and then
Monday, this episode popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautifully timed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a nice introduction from me
and then Tad takes it really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to listen to Tad's
podcast, I highly recommend a notebook and
[SPEAKER_00]: a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to learn a lot about
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn a lot about organic
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn about permaculture and you
will certainly learn about mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the podcast is called Cannabis
Cultivation and Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend it if you want to
expand your cultivation knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast World, that's all I've got for you
for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you feel like this episode was

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 370 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I've been smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of strawberry
diesel ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells like skunky strawberries
and just funky fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you dab it at a nice low
temperature, it tastes like strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: and cream with a hint of skunky gassiness
in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like eating some strawberry
shortcake at the gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it kind of smells like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab test on the front here says 72.3%
THC with a total cannabinoid content of
[SPEAKER_00]: 83.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the texture and consistency are
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is just enough terp sauce in here
and it's got some nice chunky crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really happy with that purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great concentrate from our friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next order of business is to give a
couple of people some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Brett
Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant shout out to Riley
Hansen, a big shout out to Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: Panther, a big thank you shout out to Sam,
and also a giant fist bump and a shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for the continued Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That series starts at episode 351.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this series of lessons, we started by
setting a goal for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we decided a good place for our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we acquired the appropriate equipment
and set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we either acquired seeds or clones
and we got those growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in my grow lessons,
we should have small plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 8 to 12 inches tall and they
are in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably in either beer cups or
four inch pots or maybe six or eight inch
[SPEAKER_00]: net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be nice and healthy at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have nice branching coming out
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should not have any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or any powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully at this point, we don't have any
burned leaves or any signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we have got a nice developed,
thriving root system to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if most of those things are accurate,
we've got a nice healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a nice healthy root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to transplant our small plants
into our larger pot, our finishing pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and start the large veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these plants will probably finish out
in these pots unless you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant one more time into an even
larger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go from the small pot into my
finishing pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm generally going to go into a three
gallon or a five gallon or a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: in an indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys may choose to go larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to go from the small six inch
net pot, maybe to a one gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe into your 20 or 30 gallon if
you're going to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked in a previous episode about why
it's a good idea to use a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: container for smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to water this giant area
when we've got a tiny plant right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to go to like a 20 or
30 gallon pot, you may want to go from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup to maybe a one gallon, maybe a three
gallon, then later on transplant that into
[SPEAKER_00]: your 20 or 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets challenging when you go to
transplant larger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not experienced with it,
you can cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to lay that larger plant on its
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to remove that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need to pot a much larger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get difficult, but I have faith in
you that you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to transplant twice,
just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we're going to focus on
transplanting one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go from this small beer cup
or our four inch or our six inch net pot
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe an eight inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to pot into a three or a
five or a seven gallon pot for my example.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about pots and
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a long episode about choosing pots
and soil, but let's do a brief recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the plastic nursery pots in
a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility, I like to use a
root pot, one of the fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most applications, I am using a three
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use whatever kind of pots make you
happy as long as it's going to get you to
[SPEAKER_00]: your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I find most important is to make
sure that whatever container you use,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has plenty of holes for drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that when you water this plant,
the excess water has some way to escape
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bottom of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nursery pots have plenty of holes in
them already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fabric pots will drain naturally just
because they're mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those work perfectly if you're going to
use a home depot bucket or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you drill plenty of drainage
holes in your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about soil or a
soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy a really expensive
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to feed your plants with
bottled nutrients, you can buy an inert
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a soil or a soilless mix
with a lot of nutrients and a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be on top of fertilizing
these plants with your bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't need to pay extra money for a
soil or a soilless mix that's got a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give us the opportunity to burn
our plants because we're going to add them
[SPEAKER_00]: to a soil that's got nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to add bottled nutrients
on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do run the risk of over-fertilizing the
plants in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really need an over-fertilized
soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need something more inert, maybe
something with some mycos or some
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungus in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be advantageous, but we don't
really need a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever medium you choose to purchase,
I recommend you get something with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of aeration in it, either a lot of perlite
or a lot of persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't come with plenty of
aeration product already in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a bag of perlite and amend it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the amount of perlite or persolite
you're going to need to add to your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or soilless mix will depend on the
fluffiness and the amount of aeration in
[SPEAKER_00]: that medium when you purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're going to
purchase, so I'm not sure what to
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend as a ratio of how much perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm working with cocoa, I mix three
bags of cocoa and one five-gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: of perlite and one five-gallon bucket of
persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that gives me about 25 to 30
three-gallon pots worth of material to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can reduce that recipe as needed
for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I were working with soil or a
soilless mix, I might not use as much
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may reduce that perlite by about half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need, in my opinion,
I don't need as much aeration in soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix as I do in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the cocoa holds a lot more
water, so it also pushes out a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: air and it kind of crushes the plants a
little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets heavier because it's got so much
water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil and soilless mix doesn't hold as
much water, so it doesn't get as heavy and
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't crush the roots as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need as much perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go half as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're doing three bags of soil,
do half of a five-gallon bucket of
[SPEAKER_00]: persolite and half of a five-gallon bucket
of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys aren't going to buy the
persolite, I understand it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another product to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get by with just using perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite is just fine for this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only want to buy the one product,
that will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three bags of soil and maybe one bag of
perlite for this application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I work in larger batches than a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to reduce this recipe for a
smaller garden, I think they sell the bags
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil in 1.75 cubic yards is what I
think most of those bags of dirt are,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least the bags of cocoa I was buying
are 1.75 cubic yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy 1.77 cubic yards of dirt,
mix that with a third of a five-gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just fill the bucket up about a third,
maybe halfway if you want to go hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mix that in really well with your
soil so that it's nicely even,
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly mixed in there with everything else
so that you just see the little white
[SPEAKER_00]: spots everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know you've got plenty of
aeration throughout your entire root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while we're mixing up perlite into our
soil, why not mix in some sort of root
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that's a great way to segue
into actually starting to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a good soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well aerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put a micro product in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's actually get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step number one, you guys, is always find
the Bluetooth speaker and put on the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the plants happy and it puts you
in a good mood to create a positive garden
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step number one, find the Bluetooth
speaker or find your earbuds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your earbuds in, get hooked up with
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to make your garden grow so
much more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you grow more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make everything go better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step number one, find the Grow From
Your Heart podcast, get it at an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable volume and get that going in
the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step number two, get some rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often overlook this step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should always be wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're coming in contact with the mycos,
if we're coming in contact with the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're coming in contact with bottled
nutrients, we should be wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're going to be sprinkling
those micro products over your top soil
[SPEAKER_00]: just all willy nilly, maybe you might want
to consider some sort of a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really want to breathe in micro
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the podcast on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gloved up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a face mask on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your dreadlocks tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're nicely medicated if
that's appropriate wherever you work or
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's actually get to business here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fill our container,
whatever size container we chose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fill it with our well mixed
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our soil list mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we've got a bunch of perlite in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we added a micro product to
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's ready to go into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to fill my containers by using a
smaller container just to scoop dirt out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bag or whatever container it's in
and just dump it right into the pot that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it up most of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're filling up a three gallon,
five gallon or seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill it up most of the way, but leave
yourself about an inch and a half or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: two inches at the top where you don't fill
it all the way up, all the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: brim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave yourself about inch and a half,
two inches so that when we water,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got some room to put water in the
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to pour water on the pot
and watch it run right off the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have to stand there and
pour water really slowly to where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get that whole quarter or half or gallon
of water into the pot so you can water it
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be able to just splash a gallon
of water on top of a seven gallon pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: just watch it saturate that whole top area
and then you can just walk away and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: next pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fill it up too far, you got to just
stand there and pour it slowly to where
[SPEAKER_00]: the water saturates into the medium and
drains down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can pour a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leave yourself some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the future, we may choose to top
dress these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may want to add some worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to add some bat guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just add some fresh soil with some
charged up nutrients in it to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leave yourself some room so that you've
got options and you've got watering space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you are filling your container,
pack your medium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it packed real snug,
but you don't want it fluffy and loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make the roots work to dig down
into the dirt and have some more to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of do a little exercise to get in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also don't want to suffocate them
and make it so hard that the roots simply
[SPEAKER_00]: can't grow into the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to pack it a little bit,
but don't crush it so tight to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots can't even grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you packed it too loosely,
you will notice on the first couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: waterings, you'll just get a giant hole in
the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the dirt will just cave in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll create a hole in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have to repack it,
put more dirt in there, then re-water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't mess up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just should have gone a little harder
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go too hard, the roots just aren't
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go too soft, the water is just
going to fall right through and you will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely get indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pack it slightly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just use the palm of my hand and
I give it just a few pats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw in just a few scoops of dirt just
to give myself a few inches of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just pat it in and then I throw
in some more dirt and then I just pat it
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear me just tapping on the table
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just patting it down, just getting the
dirt nice and even in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just pour more dirt on top of
it, just pat it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather pour some in and then pack it
down and then pour some in and pack it
[SPEAKER_00]: down instead of fill it up and then try to
pack all that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's kind of, it's not
really as productive as packing each
[SPEAKER_00]: little layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pour some dirt in there, pack it down,
pour some dirt, pack it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself up to about an inch and a
half or two inches to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got our three, our five or seven
gallon pot filled with our appropriate mix
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is leveled off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got about an inch and a half or
two inches of space so that we can add
[SPEAKER_00]: water or top dress later in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the very center of that pot,
we need to create a space for our
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to create a little hole in which
to place our small root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I like to do it is find the middle
of that topsoil and just dig out about a
[SPEAKER_00]: fist size worth of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take out about just a fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pretty big fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just take out about a fist size worth
of dirt right in the center of that
[SPEAKER_00]: topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then whatever size pot my plant is already
in, say I'm in a beer cup or maybe I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: a six inch net pot, I will take a beer cup
or a six inch net pot and I will dig a
[SPEAKER_00]: hole in my new potsoil right at the top,
right in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will actually plant the cup in that
hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will dig a hole perfectly to where that
cup will fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will backfill dirt around that cup,
kind of snug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will pull the cup or the six inch
net pot out of that made hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have got a perfect template that is
the exact shape of the incoming root ball
[SPEAKER_00]: from my small veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically leveled off the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dug out a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the previous pot in that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I backfilled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just pulled that pot right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made an impression, a template,
just a little gap for the next plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit perfectly into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a top layer of soil with
this little round hole perfectly waiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: just chilling, waiting for a pot to go in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our next step is to pot our small veg
plant into that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do that, you know what I'm
going to recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sprinkle a little mycopowder right
into that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our fresh exposed roots are going to go
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just sprinkle some mycopowder right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just give it some love, give it a
boost, give it a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like laying out some cookies
for Santa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get it nice and ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some mycopowder right in the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our next challenge will be to get the
small plant out of that small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it has grown really tight into
your beer cup or really tight into your
[SPEAKER_00]: six inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nicely root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of root mass in that
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a little effort to
get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I do it is I make a spock hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my first finger and my middle
finger together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my ring finger and my pinky
finger together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I place the stick of the plant between my
middle finger and my ring finger,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root ball, the soil is in my palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the plant is hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding onto the root ball with my
spock hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that in my left hand because I don't
need as much coordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can just stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take my right hand and I kind of
just squeeze the cup or the beer cup or
[SPEAKER_00]: the six inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just squeeze it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever rolled a joint too tight
and you're trying to loosen the joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to loosen the dirt out
of that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just squeeze all around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you really got to do and you'll
feel it loosening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe squeeze it and work it to the left
and right just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel how to loosen the dirt inside
of that pot once you start doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you're trying to do is loosen the dirt
so that it will fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little shake and it's going to
fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have an exposed root zone
in your hand now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully when it came out, it all stayed
together in one big chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've taken good care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've properly watered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've given it proper dry time and the
roots have developed nice and fat in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all just one chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came out as a mess, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to pot that whole mess
into that hole that we already made and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the root ball out of the
container, you already know what I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle a little Mycos on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got exposed roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roots love Mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Mycos are activated by touching
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle them on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it as much Myco powder as you can
afford to sprinkle on there at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it a nice little coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just infect it with root inoculant powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to, if it came out in a mess,
you need to gently place it in that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get as much of that original dirt as you
can in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the root ball down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some, so maybe put the, if they're
dangling long roots, set the dangly roots
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little dirt on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower the plant in a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some dirt on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower it in a little bit more so that you
don't bind those roots up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to give those roots space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just drop them right in
there and smother them with fresh dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they came apart, keep them apart
when you're putting them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then backfill it with all the dirt from
that container and you should have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt there to level everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lost some dirt during the movement,
just grab some more dirt out of your mix
[SPEAKER_00]: and just top it to where you have a nice
even layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of pack it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not super tight, just tight enough to keep
that plant staying straight upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if it came out nice and smooth,
now we've got another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came out nice and smooth and you
feel like those roots are perfect and they
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't super bound, but they're growing
well, you can just set still, sprinkle
[SPEAKER_00]: some Mycos on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can set that perfect root ball
right into that perfect hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe sprinkle a little bit of dirt on top
of it and pat it in and you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully transplanted plant that didn't
get any shock or any stress whatsoever
[SPEAKER_00]: during the transplanting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our other option, when you take it out of
the small container, if it is really bound
[SPEAKER_00]: up in there, if you see a lot of white
roots and it is growing in a circle and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting spiraled, you do have the
option to kind of break those roots up
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I do it is I hold it with my left
hand and I take my middle finger and my
[SPEAKER_00]: ring finger on my right hand and I come
straight up from the bottom of that root
[SPEAKER_00]: ball and I just plow my fingers through it
and just pull it apart, just spread it
[SPEAKER_00]: right in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to tear some roots up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to mess some stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a nice healthy root system,
that is only going to encourage growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spreading it out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you set it in that template hole
that you've got, the roots will spread out
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit and instead of growing in a
perfect spiral, they're going to take off
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit for you and fill that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either way, sprinkle Mycos on the roots
on that root ball that you pull out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, sprinkle some Mycos on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always sprinkle some Mycos into the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then gently place that small root ball
into that fresh hole and just cover it
[SPEAKER_00]: with dirt gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't pack it down too tightly,
but pack it down tight enough to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's not going to cave in when we
water it and that it's tight enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: give that plant enough support to stay
upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know on the first watering if you
did not do it tightly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't do it tight enough,
you're just going to need to add more
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that plant is basically transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you label that plant at this
time before you forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to move that plant under
the appropriate light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also mention you may need a
saucer or some sort of a catch tray
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we water these plants, we expect to
have some runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is a good time to consider placing
your plant on a saucer or some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: catch tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the trays down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the lighting and which
we're going to place these plants under.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use T5s for your fresh
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the T5s really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get those T5 lights three,
maybe four inches away from your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that you adjust them every
day because the plants are going to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly and they will grow into those
lights if you don't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use ceramic metal halide for
your fresh transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 315s or the 630s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to keep those a little bit
further away than the T5s, probably about
[SPEAKER_00]: a foot, maybe 18 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are very brand and power specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would follow the recommendation from the
manufacturer on your LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough experience with your
LED to know what it's going to do to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many vendors, so many
different makes and models that it is hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to give advice for LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you certainly can use LEDs through the
entire cycle and you can absolutely use
[SPEAKER_00]: them right now for your fresh transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use metal halide or high
pressure sodium, also known as high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to use high intensity
discharge lighting, pay close attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: how the plants are reacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a 400, you can probably
get 12 to 18 inches away and not have any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were using a 600, you could
probably get 18 inches away and not have
[SPEAKER_00]: any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a thousand watt light,
you may want to start off about two feet
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the canopy, maybe even more as
you start introducing these plants to that
[SPEAKER_00]: larger light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time goes on, you can get closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will grow closer to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you are introducing young plants
to large lights, pay attention to how they
[SPEAKER_00]: react.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to burn these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stress them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to burn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stress the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to put them into any kind of
shock right as we transplant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a critical time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to put them into turbo mode
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to slow them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to punish them and put them
on timeout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give them encouragement to take
off right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our plants under the
appropriate light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our light the appropriate
distance away.
[SPEAKER_00]: From our canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the amount of light hours
we are going to give these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked earlier about lighting
schedules and apparently in a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, I did make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point I said something about 18 on
and 16 off or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said your light cycle will always
add up to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my light cycle I said didn't add up to
24 hours, I was too high to be doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when you talk as much as I do,
I think you're going to make a few
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes and I encourage you guys to let
me know when I make a mistake so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said I did make a light cycle
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow me to correct myself in this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several cycles that work very
well for our veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One common cycle is 24 hours on and zero
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mainly recommend this if you have mother
plants that tend to auto flower on you or
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next option is 20 hours on and four
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give the plants a few hours to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also gives my equipment four hours to
rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running a veg room with 25
lights, that is a hundred hours of lights
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't have to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of electricity that you save.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also not paying for as much cooling
and humidity control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 20 on and four off is good for your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plants get to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't want to take a nap?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the roots do a lot of activity
in the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the plants grow a lot in the
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugars are processed in the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 on four off is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make any plants that may want to
auto flower in a lesser cycle that will
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent them from auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will also give you maximum growth
and it will keep your mother plants really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very common veg cycle is 18 on and
six off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very common because it very
closely mimics the outdoor cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: of the natural light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is 16 on and eight off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar to outdoors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason people will adjust between the
16 and eight and the 18 and six is because
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants will try to flower on their
own with the 16 hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get large enough and once they
get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I feel like more light is more
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one desired source of
energy and nutrient for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not maximize the light input?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, some plants will only take so
much light per day and they'll just shut
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think you're going to overload
them with light in a small grow room with
[SPEAKER_00]: a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, our options are 24 hours on and
zero hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't really recommend that for these
large veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next option is 20 hours on and four
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, that is what
I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another environment, you can go eight
16 on and six off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is 16 on and eight off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I found advantageous of the
20 on and four off is when I do induce
[SPEAKER_00]: that 12-12 flowering cycle, those plants
really notice a change in photo period and
[SPEAKER_00]: they really go into flower really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that I found has
helped quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of those light cycles will work for
your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find pros and cons to each of
those options based on your environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: your location, your setup, and your
overall grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to find things
through trial and error when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try some things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what works best for you and your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it's going to come down to
what works best for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, our small veg plants have
been up potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now large veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them in their forever pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got them underneath a good light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got that light on a solid schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our pots sitting on a saucer or
some sort of a catch tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now time to water our new
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend feeding these transplants with
a strong vegetative nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bottle that says veg,
that's the one you need right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something with a good NPK ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more N, then you do P and K.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a high N ratio for this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend a Myco product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not put plenty of powdered
Mycos in there, I recommend a Mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal product that is in liquid form that
you can feed right in your nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a small dash of carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of carbohydrates will help
feed those Mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it will give the plants a little bit
of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend a little bit of Cal Mag
at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are big enough to take Cal Mag,
give them a little bit of a boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend a little bit of
enzymes at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will speed everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help keep the root zone nice and
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Myco products and the enzymes will
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will make a happy rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also want to add a little bit of
potassium silicates at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium silicates make for robust
plants, and it will also help with any
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any environmental stressors,
that potassium silicate will make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants just a little more resilient and a
little tougher for the mistakes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I recommend you adjust the pH of your
feed solution to somewhere between 6.2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were in Coco in a commercial
facility, I would tell the guys to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH to 6.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were in a soilless mix in a
commercial facility, I would tell them to
[SPEAKER_00]: go 6.3 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mix up your nutrient solution,
put your pH meter in there, see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: value is, and adjust up or down as
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down, then water the plants
with that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about watering plants,
I highly recommend you go back and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to episode 337, which is titled One
Through Five Watering Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: One Through Five Watering Tech will help
all growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're an
experienced grower, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional grower, you will learn
something from the One Through Five Water
[SPEAKER_00]: Tech episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an experienced grower and
you're trying to teach a new grower how to
[SPEAKER_00]: water your garden, One Through Five Water
Tech is a great training exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend everybody listen to episode
337.
[SPEAKER_00]: And learn about One Through Five Watering
Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before you water your plants,
we talked about the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not talk about the temperature of
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wintertime in Colorado and it is
really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pulling water right out of the
tap, it's coming out of the tap way too
[SPEAKER_00]: cold to apply to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the water that we feed our plants
to be right around 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 65 would be acceptable, but I
wouldn't go much lower than 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine sticking your feet in some 65
degree water first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's like when you water the
plants with 65 degree water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't go any lower than 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stay closer to 70, maybe up in the
75, not much warmer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around 70 degrees is just about
ideal for watering the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, you can always just turn
the hot water on as you're filling up your
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some environments, we don't have the
option for hot water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your water is coming out too cold,
you can either get a bucket heater from
[SPEAKER_00]: your local tractor or farm supply store,
they just sell bucket heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sell them at the farm supply
store for troughs so that you can warm up
[SPEAKER_00]: the pig and horse water so they don't have
to drink ice water in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if a bucket heater is not an option for
you, you can always fill up containers of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take them into the flowering rooms
or the bedrooms the day before and let
[SPEAKER_00]: that light and that grow room environment
warm up the water for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's only if you remember to
do that the day before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is don't feed the plants water
that is really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that water to be right around 70
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this first watering, make sure you
really saturate the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have plenty of water coming
out of those drainage holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure to soak every spot of
the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want a dry spot because roots
will not grow into dry areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients aren't getting into those dry
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you fully saturate the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to soak it every time I water,
but it's mostly important this very first
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it till you get a lot of water
coming out of those holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't leave the plant ever standing
in stagnant water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that water in the bottom of your tray
there doesn't evaporate or get sucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: by that plant within a few hours,
get a shot vac and suck that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now our plants are all successfully
transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have now been fed their big kid
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the
environment in which to keep these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where to keep the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what cycle to have the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the day, I try to keep the
temperature between 70 and 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I try to keep the night around 65 to
75.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try to have no more than a 10
degree swing in my temperature between day
[SPEAKER_00]: and night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if it's 70 during the day,
I want it no lower than 60 during the
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly try to keep about five to seven
degrees in that swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's difficult in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we don't have the appropriate
equipment to monitor and or adjust things
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do your best to keep it within a 10
degree differential between night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point in the large veg phase,
I try to keep the humidity between 40 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around 50 is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to understand more about why I
keep the humidity and the temperature the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I do, I recommend you check out
episode 314 and it's called Vapor Pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can learn about VPD and why it's
important to keep the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in the appropriate range for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I like to add to our large
veg is a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have wall fans or those fans on
stands depending on your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to have a fan just oscillating
in the room, circulating the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to circulate the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to move the stale air around and
move that fresh air around so the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have fresh air constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to beat the shit out of the
plants with the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in some grows and they're just
terrorizing plants with fans and just
[SPEAKER_00]: beating them to death and wondering why
the plants look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to rustle the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to move the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to put a fan, about one fan
every one or two lights depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the room and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure that every area is getting
fresh air in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I feel like we have
officially entered the large veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main goals and focus now are to keep
the plants pest and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to avoid nutrient and pH mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure not to overfeed our plants at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, pay very close attention to the pH
of your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep these plants healthy and
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to work on the top part of the
plants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on the bottom for the first
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to focus more on the top
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in the upcoming episodes,
we're going to work on shaping and
[SPEAKER_00]: structuring these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to talk about popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about bottoming and
topping and lollipopping our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is all in upcoming episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two quick things to cover before
we start wrapping up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are out of here for this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, one thing I should talk about is
pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to apply pesticide
sprays, today is a good day to start that
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are moving into the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in their big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and hit them with a light
pesticide spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off the lights, douse the plants,
give them a couple hours to dry off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the lights back on to the regularly
scheduled program and pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you wrote down exactly what you
sprayed on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wrote down the product and you wrote
how much per gallon you applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wrote down what time you applied it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a good frame of reference
so you can go in and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how the plants reacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look angry, you need to reduce the
application next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they look happy about it, you can do
the same thing or consider increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: application rate if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I generally start my heavy pest
management application right when I move
[SPEAKER_00]: them into the large pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that will be important to
think about is flip time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are these plants going to veg in
this environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much space do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your genetics, depending on
your lighting, depending on your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, these plants could double in
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working within a rise cross,
there is a good likelihood that by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you finish that plant, it will be
twice the size it was when you started the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that plant is 24 inches tall when
you induce flowering, there's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance that plant will end up 48 inches
tall before it is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, you need to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that plant does not
grow up into your lights and burn itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to save, depending on the type of
light you're using, you need to save some
[SPEAKER_00]: space between the bulb and your top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to start thinking about
how long we're going to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you veg too long, the plants will get
too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to do things like topping
and bottoming and lollipopping and
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting and cracking and trellising and
manipulating these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to need to give them a
little bit of time to recover from some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these techniques before we initiate the
flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we plan ahead and know how long we
anticipate to veg, we can predict when to
[SPEAKER_00]: do these steps to increase production and
flower at the ideal time and fill our grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can end up with our canopy right about
eight inches below that light and it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and even and it'll look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have any wasted space in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're an experienced grower,
your goal will be to fill your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a five by five grow tent,
you want a five by five canopy or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: a four and a half by four and a half
canopy because when the air flows,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sucks in a little bit, but you want to
fill most of that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very experienced grower, an older guy,
he said one day, if you had a cooler and
[SPEAKER_00]: you could fill it with beer, would you
fill it most of the way to the top with
[SPEAKER_00]: beer or would you fill that cooler all the
way with beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even a beer drinker and that makes
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want as many beers fit in that cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want your grow room to be halfway
filled with buds or do you want to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucker up with buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal will be to maximize that canopy
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In future episodes, we will talk about
trellising, lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about sticks and cages and
cracking stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will go in depth in a lot of techniques
like that on ways to fill up your cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: for maximum production.

[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Banana OG
Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, it says it is 83.2% THC and
a total of 97% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of a change from what I usually
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like a concentrate that makes my
head spin, makes my eyes vibrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it hard to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Banana OG is kind of more of a mellow
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me kind of chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of slow motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my eyes nice and heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my shoulders nice and chilled
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really dig the flavor of the Banana
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are taking dabs of
something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you can tell, but I still
have a little bit of that head cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to let it slow me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to deliver a quality podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I plan to bring you
another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the grow lesson,
I've got a couple of quick things to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am iRegenetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently doing some updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the process of updating the
website, something went completely
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking wrong and the podcast does not
work from the website anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the episodes that were up before
the update are still accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the new things I add to the
website are posting to the RSS feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My web guy is working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the holiday weekend, so he has taken
a few days off, but I'm sure he will get
[SPEAKER_00]: back on it as soon as the weekend is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, I know the website is messed
up and I apologize for not having the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes out on iTunes and Stitcher as
regularly scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just recently bragging about not
missing a Monday in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've missed the least one Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I may potentially miss two
Mondays in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the episodes are recorded and the
shows are posted on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I have not stopped recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't stopped doing the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just unable to post them to iTunes and
Stitcher because of a glitch with my
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, please be patient with me and please
keep listening to the show and please find
[SPEAKER_00]: the show on YouTube if that is your only
option of listening for the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, real quick, I want to give a
shout out to the guy who works on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he listens to the show
regularly or at all, but hey, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening, man, big thanks for keeping the
website updated, big thanks for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: updates lately, and also big thanks for
getting it fixed when you do get the RSS
[SPEAKER_00]: feed back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm giving shout outs, let's give
some shout outs to a few of our Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big shout out to Jade.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big Patreon shout out to
Grimble the Druid and also a Patreon shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Tanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, another shout out to my
friend Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you for all of the
Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier this was going to be
another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far in my series of grow lessons,
we should have plants that are probably 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to 14, maybe 16 or 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably in three or five or
maybe seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they are nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a fat root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're pest free at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you haven't over or under
fertilized them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a lot about the proper
environment and conditions and feeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we know how to take care of
them by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a few ways to improve our
productivity and the vigor of our large
[SPEAKER_00]: veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, none of this stuff is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this stuff is mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the little tips and tricks and
bonus things that I do to boost
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity and boost vigor to kind of
turbocharge the overall performance of my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: One really easy thing I like to do to all
of my plants to increase performance is
[SPEAKER_00]: just clean off the crap on the bottoms of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a stock coming out of the dirt
and then you've got a few crappy branches
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off the bottom and then the next
couple of branches will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial and then you'll have some
solid branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those very bottom branches are crappy,
don't be afraid to remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like they are a waste of
growth on the plant, feel free to take
[SPEAKER_00]: them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to lollipop heavily once we
go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to move some of the
crappy bottom branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a long, healthy branch that has
the potential to reach the canopy level,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's ugly, if it's droopy,
if it's sucking up energy and not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce anything that would be worthwhile,
feel free to take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that plant can focus its energy
moving up toward the top of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: where we want to build that lush canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to take crap off of the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've removed the crappy bottom
branches that are kind of a waste of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is another thing we can do to the
bottom section of our plant to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance and move the energy up toward
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've still got bottom branches because we
left some of those bottom branches on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside bottom branching is not going
to receive much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is find that branch
and just follow it up and remove any
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots that I feel like are a waste of
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have a thick arm coming off,
and then off of that you'll have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny sub-arm coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom of the plant, those are a
waste of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to turn into buds we do
not want to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be fluffy, larpy,
useless little crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a trimmer's nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: By removing that crap from the bottom,
we direct the energy up toward the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make bigger top chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are better for trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are better for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are better for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants those big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's clean off that crap off the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the main stock coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your bottom two,
your bottom four branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow those branches up and where you
don't see any light touching those little
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots, feel free to just pinch them or
cut them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're cutting or pinching or
cleaning stuff off of plants, always keep
[SPEAKER_00]: this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back later and take more off,
but you cannot glue the leaves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots back onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on that bottom section, just pull that
crap in the inside right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go fairly hard on the bottom parts of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on lollipopping heavily early in
flower anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not pull off a lot of that crap now
and send the energy up toward the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while you're cleaning the bottoms of
the plants, keep in mind that it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: wise to take some clones before we put
these plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to grow next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing from seed that you spent a
lot of money on?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you paid a lot of money for those
seeds, I definitely recommend you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone off of each seedling and mark it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about this in depth in
a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a plant from seed,
I recommend you take a clone from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark that plant, plant A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark your clone, clone A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on down the line with every seedling
plant that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either grow out the clone or grow out the
original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got something amazing,
now you have got a keeper clone of that to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that sort of
stuff in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something to think about while
we are cleaning the bottoms of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to use those two bottom
branches?
[SPEAKER_00]: May make excellent clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those shoots may have grown big
enough to turn into a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind while you're cleaning up
the bottoms of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about another way to
improve the productivity of our plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: also a great way to score a great clone
from a healthy place in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say appropriate time,
we can do this at just about any point in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plant is large enough,
the plants we are talking about are
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly large enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are in large veg, this is prime time
for topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to top approximately 10 to 14 days
before we enter the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we top a cannabis plant, our mission
is to remove that top node out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, that giant one that's sticking out
of the top, making it look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to remove that and our goal is to
make the next set of branches become two
[SPEAKER_00]: tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will create competition within
the branches of the plant that will make
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the branches try to reach up and
become the next top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, somebody killed the king and
now all of those next soldiers are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the next king.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones in the plant will indicate
we're missing a top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody needs to take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has a trait that is called apical
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really wants one dominant top.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you remove that dominant top,
the rest of the tops know there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for them to become that main
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can top the plants at various ages
and at various stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the process of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up and talk about doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that top branch where it's too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trace it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I like to do it, I kind of find a
spot where I'm thinking about cutting it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I bend it over and I look at the plant
and I say, what would the plant look like
[SPEAKER_00]: without that section?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that too tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much to cut off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to be beneficial?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is my goal in topping right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly my goal, instead of having one
giant top, I want to create sort of a bush
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I can grow space and not have one
giant bud hitting the light, but instead I
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a four by four section of a bunch
of buds growing into the light instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: By taking out that main top, you create
that whole section into a bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see which one is going to cut out and
make the others look like a nice even
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take a little bit of trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take some confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also very strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping an OG Kush or something like that
can be a real bitch because the nodes are
[SPEAKER_00]: so far apart that you just make it look
like a Charlie Brown Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it grows out of that,
it is going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more sativa dominant stuff,
if you top scarlet begonias, if you top
[SPEAKER_00]: storm shadow, it makes a beautiful bush
and they go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of grab the top and work your way
down with your hand and just kind of look
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what it would look like if I took
this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll come to a point, you'll take
off one and you'll see two branches that
[SPEAKER_00]: stick up evenly toward the top and the two
branches underneath that almost come right
[SPEAKER_00]: up to that top section as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have four nice new tops and you'll
say, that's what Rasta Jeff is talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make these four tops,
the tops, then just cut that one out and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see exactly what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to screw up a couple
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musicians have to fuck up songs to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: BMX racers have to fall on their face to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skateboarders get stitches and break bones
to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, we mess up plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hurt us that bad when we cut up
a plant the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got a couple more and
you're going to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of cutting that one plant from
what you learn from it is invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and just play around with
the scissors, top some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom some of them up, see what they do,
finish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you have some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that data is very
strained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific, like I said earlier,
if you're topping an OG Kush plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have totally different
results than if you're topping something
[SPEAKER_00]: like a haze or a more sativa dominant,
like a golden goat kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth structure is just naturally
different in those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're topping your plant,
do it at the intersection where it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage that plant the most expansive
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got two branches,
you've got the main stock coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a branch coming out and then
maybe an inch up, you've got a branch
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out, cut right above that top
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to leave anything hanging
off or anything extra, cut it right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: intersection where you want to encourage
the spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically want to take an upside down
peace sign and you want to turn it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: Y and those new tops of the Y are going to
be the new two tops of the plant and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the next two branches, hopefully they'll
catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that puts me back to why I said we
want to do this at least 10 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: before we go into flower or much sooner
than that if it's an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make that cut, we've just cut out
the king like I said earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need time for those hormones to move
around into the plant and that helps us
[SPEAKER_00]: when we go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get much larger bud sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flower too soon after topping,
your plants just create little popcorn
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones haven't moved around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not exactly sure what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sure where the top should go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just get a bunch of little
popcorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give the plant plenty of time to
recover, plenty of time to move the
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones and plenty of time for it to
decide where the tops are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: after topping and before moving your
plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned that this would be a
good opportunity for a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That top you just cut off should be the
most robust, hardiest part of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make a great candidate for a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not snag that up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a big fat healthy clone for
the next crop while you're increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of the current crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've covered two great ways
to increase the vigor and productivity of
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured out how to properly move the
energy to the part of the plant we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can move it up to the top by taking
stuff off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spread it out by completely
eliminating the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that process, we've also created the
opportunity to create clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about another great
technique that I use in a personal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this in a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this in a large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I implement in almost
any grow I get to play in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the pop and twist technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As super cropping, it has got a lot of
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same thing no matter what we
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pop the stems of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of pop their knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can hear that on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to get it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the sound I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the plants are a little bit thicker
than a pen or a pencil, maybe a Sharpie,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grab them right where they come
out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab the stock kind of firmly with one
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I grab it with another hand right
above it and I twist my top hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't twist that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hand that's coming out of the dirt,
I don't want to twist that dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I twist the top hand to where I break the
cellulose of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break that outer structure to where you
hear it pop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go crunch just like my knuckle did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make a little pop sound and you'll
feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be freaked out the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing exactly what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will increase vigor and productivity
in a couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be beneficial in a couple of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that real quick and we'll
talk more about how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the entire plant, the first
thing you'll notice when you're popping
[SPEAKER_00]: the knuckles or bigger buds, also those
bigger stems can probably feed those
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger flowers better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got more movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way this is beneficial is it will
slow down the vertical growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't get so tall so quickly because
they will be spending a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: their energy on getting fatter and more
robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be short and stocky, which is way
beneficial to almost any grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are limited by height.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, in a commercial grow,
in a giant warehouse grow, most of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: still limited by height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having this one tip to control the
height of our plants just a little bit can
[SPEAKER_00]: be very advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, we're going to talk about
trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can use cracking and trellising
together, you can really control the
[SPEAKER_00]: height of your plants and you can really
maximize productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a few reasons why I like to
crack the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more about
actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've given you a good reason why
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I grab the stick with one
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab the stick with another and I just
twist opposite directions and you'll hear
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go pop and crunch, then just move
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start with the main stock of the plant
and I work my way almost 90% up the way of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I can feel it still crunching,
as long as I'm not feeling like I'm about
[SPEAKER_00]: to rip the top off the plant when I give
it a twist, I'll work my way right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go to the bottom branch and work my
way right up the bottom branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next branch and give it a crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it a crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the microphone stand here
trying to think about the distance of
[SPEAKER_00]: cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go one and then it's only four to six
inches apart, depending on the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will crack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if it's a tiny plant, if they're
short and squat, I would go every three
[SPEAKER_00]: inches if I feel like that plant could
take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them will take it about every four
to six inches without any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little crack, move up,
give it a little crack, move up,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a little crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do that to every plant in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will slow down their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make them more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be more vigorous and you can
continue to do this all the way into about
[SPEAKER_00]: week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start it early in veg, you can get
a good cracking in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them about seven, maybe 10 days to
heal up, go back, give them another good
[SPEAKER_00]: crack, throw them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get bigger, they will recover more
quickly from being busted on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and give them a good crack on
day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the start of the flowering cycle,
slow down that stretch a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you crack spot one and then spot two,
there's a spot in the middle of that that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can crack next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back in a week and even if they
haven't healed up from all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking, you can crack those middle spots
and make even another little knuckle,
[SPEAKER_00]: another little knurled spot on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to get in there and do
some work on them and bust them up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will recover and they will really
show progress from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I probably sound like I'm crazy
because for the past 10 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been telling you to cut stuff off of
your plants and break them and bend them
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's going to increase productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you get stronger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Through stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through proper training and that's what
we're going to do to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to tell them what we want from
them and we're going to show them what we
[SPEAKER_00]: expect and they're going to give it to us
with the proper guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of guidance, let's work our way
into talking about canopy control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I mentioned that our plants are
apical dominant, meaning they want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately for us as growers,
it does not benefit us for the plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fill horizontal space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to spread them out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several options.
[SPEAKER_00]: For encouraging our plants to spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our earlier work of topping them was a
great start, but we can go much further
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very easy, affordable and effective way
to spread out our plants a little bit is
[SPEAKER_00]: by using sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get bamboo sticks at the local
grow store for very cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put about four sticks per pot
and I like to put them toward the outer
[SPEAKER_00]: edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too far in because you've got a
lot of root development there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go shoving a bamboo
stick right through a bunch of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go out toward the edge of the pot,
put the stick in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are going to grow six feet
tall, get a six foot stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are only going to grow
three feet tall, get a three foot stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a stick too big to where
you can't lower the light close enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the appropriate size stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put three or four, five or six of them in
the pot, depending on how many giant
[SPEAKER_00]: floppy branches you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can just pull those big branches
down just a little bit and attach them to
[SPEAKER_00]: the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, instead of just having them going
straight up, you've kind of pulled them
[SPEAKER_00]: down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're probably one or two,
maybe three inches shorter, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how far you pull them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull them down and affix them to those
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're doing a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making the plant overall shorter
and you're also widening the plant up to
[SPEAKER_00]: let some light get into that inner part of
the plant where you don't have to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: off as much of that crap in the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the light can penetrate in there
and you will get more production from the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these sticks will also work for
another purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those buds start to develop and get
fat and big, those sticks will
[SPEAKER_00]: support your buds.
You're going to need something to hold up
the big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need something to hold up
the big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it out of the cage, pull it out of
the cage, and as it grows, it'll work
[SPEAKER_00]: itself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets real tall, put the branch
back into the cage or use those runners up
[SPEAKER_00]: the side, the side supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always affix the branches to those
side supports by using a bread tie or a
[SPEAKER_00]: twisty tie or some sort of garden supply
twist tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of options for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to be too specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use zip ties in most cases, but don't go
too tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got your tomato cage on your
plant, the branches are falling out and
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining support from the outer perimeter
of the tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've worked some of the branches
up the side of that tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've pulled some of the branches
down and spread them out by using those
[SPEAKER_00]: outer rings of the tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomato cage gives us a lot of creative
options for controlling the canopy of our
[SPEAKER_00]: plant while at the same time providing
support for our tall, heavy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're using a tomato cage and you
did not top your plant, which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine, that is always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have to top the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like that one big glory
bud at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going for that glory bud and you
were using a tomato cage, you still may
[SPEAKER_00]: need a stick to support that giant bud if
you grow a big fat top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to make them work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a tomato cage with a stick
holding up that giant bud in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're going to put a stick in a
giant pot, I would kind of recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it toward the outer edge and then
angling it toward the center if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: support in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to ram a bamboo stake right
into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just feels rude to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it to be right in the middle
because you've got some kind of OCD or
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where you need to do it,
you can do it, but you'll feel it when you
[SPEAKER_00]: go through those roots and it won't feel
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two very effective methods of
controlling your canopy and also
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting the large branches and being
prepared for having large buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I kind of glazed over those two
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to perfect and work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix those branches to those sticks however
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little harder to lower the canopy
that way, but you can get big branch
[SPEAKER_00]: support that way really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomato cages, you can use the zip ties
or the twisty ties and you have got round
[SPEAKER_00]: circles to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use those to keep the plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bend the branches underneath the
rings of the tomato cage or you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: those to support the big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of options there to work
with, but you're going to have to play
[SPEAKER_00]: with it to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk you so far through it,
but it's going to be strained dependent,
[SPEAKER_00]: situational dependent, but those are very
versatile tools to work with and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find some use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me quit rambling and talk about
one of my favorite methods of canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: control, which is using trellis netting,
also known as Scrog netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course Scrog, S-C-R-O-G just means
screen of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using a screen to create a nice
green canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about creating a screen of
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one most common mistake I see
people make when they are setting up their
[SPEAKER_00]: screen or their trellis netting for their
screen of green or for their canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: control is they put the netting way too
loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that stuff really tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it almost scary tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a lot of tension on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want those squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the net to move at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those squares to stay right in
place because that is what is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the shape of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those things move, the plant moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them tight, nice and firm like a
guitar string.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about the netting now
that I've already pointed out the number
[SPEAKER_00]: one mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we're setting up a net in a five
by five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to set them up in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already got the poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have poles or something to
affix it to, you're going to need to
[SPEAKER_00]: design some sort of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can attach it to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will get a five gallon
bucket from Lowe's or Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will fill it up with Quick Crete and
then they will stick a six foot tall PVC
[SPEAKER_00]: pole into there sticking straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a nice vertical pole that
you can work with to attach your net to
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will hold a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably get it tight enough with
that five gallon bucket filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be enough weight to be able to
pull those screens super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get yourself four buckets, fill them up
with the Quick Crete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a six foot pole in each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you make a little square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can make just about any type of
length or width of shape you need to put
[SPEAKER_00]: your trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they sell it in five by five
squares, five by 10 squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go commercial grade,
you can get it in much larger segments,
[SPEAKER_00]: sections, whatever the word you want to
use right there, you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I recommend
the six foot wide commercial greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found a six foot wide roll of
plastic trellis netting that works
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully for that application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is six feet wide and it is I think 75
or 120 feet long and it is one roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just put it up on top of the
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one guy on one side, one guy on
the other and it's on a roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just walk and zip tie one end of it
down, one end of it down and you walk the
[SPEAKER_00]: length you need to be and you zip tie the
other end, zip tie the other end and you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut it off and now the trellis net is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you got to go back through and
tighten it by using more zip ties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's almost kind of fun once you've
got it put up that easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the long rolls are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little bit heavy, but if you've
got two big dudes, I'm 6'5", my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, he was six foot something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just grab it, lift it just above plant
height, walk right down the rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch out a long enough piece to cover
that whole row, zip tie it at the end and
[SPEAKER_00]: cut our section off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have another guy following behind us
and he would put zip ties in place to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it real tight and it would take us just a
few minutes to get each row done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to start by spreading out
your trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it comes folded up in that little
baggie, it is such a bitch to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like Spider-Man attacked you in
fucking one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be there for a few minutes
getting that unfolded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the net, the longer it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smoke a dab and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke a dab because when you get all
stoned and you're trying to look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: netting, that shit doesn't work for your
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just unfold that and then once we get
it put up, we'll go take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfold the trellis netting the best you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take you a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it put up on whatever poles you've got
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we're going to work in a five by
five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you bought a five by five
section of netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go in a square.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need to use that outer square.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to go one or two squares into
that grid to make it fit tight enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to necessarily use every
square of that netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it tight more than we want the
amount of squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that net up there tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a bunch of zip ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go excessive if you need it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that thing fairly tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lower it down onto the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll watch the plants kind of bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of bend them down just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like three or four inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see something that's about to
crack, of course grab it and give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is to actually lower the
height of all of the plants and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use that net to control the
height of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry because we're going to go back
and manually adjust each branch by hand
[SPEAKER_00]: and work it into this net correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we just kind of want to
lower it down and watch that canopy just
[SPEAKER_00]: become even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have instead of one giant bud here,
one long branch here, one giant bud on a
[SPEAKER_00]: long branch over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a nice even space to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to fill all that five by five net
with a bunch of small bud sites that will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually turn into more productivity than
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One giant bud here, one giant bud here
that are trying to touch the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fighting those from getting too hot,
getting burnt, getting crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got a bunch of buds down
here that aren't getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead we've got a nice five by five
screen of green of just beautiful even
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about how to work these
branches into this net to create this
[SPEAKER_00]: desired canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working a section of plants into a trellis
net is a bit of an art and it will take
[SPEAKER_00]: some experience to perfect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it sort of like weaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to weave these plants that want to
go vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to weave them into the net to
encourage them to go horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now almost no matter what we do to these
plants other than kill them, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to grow up because earlier we spoke
of that hormone that gives them apical
[SPEAKER_00]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to need to stay on top of
canopy control in this trellis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to fill each square of that
trellis net with a branch that will
[SPEAKER_00]: develop into a substantial bud site.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to start that process is to train
these plants to spread wide instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use this first layer of netting to
actually spread the plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we have to do as the plants grow
is they will try to pop up out of the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go in there every day and grab
those branches that tried to get away and
[SPEAKER_00]: just push them back under that next piece
of net.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as they're long enough to go
underneath the next section just weave
[SPEAKER_00]: them right underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will happen is you will develop
long arms that fill up the entire space
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we flip it to flower all of those
branches will develop bud sites that will
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up each square of that trellis
netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now instead of having plants that just
grow big giant buds and grow up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: light and are really good for pictures we
are actually producing a large crop by
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing the entire five by five canopy
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this will take some practice to figure
out exactly what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are going to try to force
those plants down too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that taught me a lot of tips on
trellis work will tell you give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to give it some more to grow up
and win.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tips of the branches like to go up
give them a chance to win but don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: scared to get in there and bend them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something that is hard to convey
through just audio without any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: visual is you may think that to get this
branch the tip of this branch under this
[SPEAKER_00]: net that you may need to bend it at wrist
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing myself I'm comparing the
microphone stand to my wrist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microphone stand is horizontal my
wrist is growing up like a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tuck this my wrist underneath
this piece of trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of grabbing at my wrist and
bending there and tucking that part under
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually go down to elbow height
to my elbow joint and pop it down there
[SPEAKER_00]: and bend it underneath the trellis at that
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a lot more room for when
that plant starts growing vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to grow out horizontally
because of gravity for a little while the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip will start growing up and it's going
to take it a little bit longer to grow up
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that net again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to crack it lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you think you need to is what I'm
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gave you enough different
explanations to try to catch on to what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying but if you think you need to
crack it here to get it underneath the net
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right here go a little lower so
you've got more bending room to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've also got more room for future
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys trellising and canopy work is an
art but when you get good at it it will
[SPEAKER_00]: drastically improve productivity and will
also make the garden much easier to work
[SPEAKER_00]: in because it's much more organized and
you don't have that one giant bud that's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow into the light which is so
photogenic and it's so beautiful to have
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also such a pain in the ass
because that's the one bud you were
[SPEAKER_00]: working your whole garden setup around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will learn how to weave your plants
into this net perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will adapt your own style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're going to the internet to
look at pictures of how to do it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a lot of great stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also see a lot of trellis nets
that were not filled sufficiently before
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants were flipped into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes more work but it is much more
rewarding than just growing that one glory
[SPEAKER_00]: bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to use the screen to
spread them out make sure you fill up that
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy before you flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also recommend a second layer of
trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably would put that one depending on
the power of your light depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably put my second net
somewhere between six and twelve inches
[SPEAKER_00]: above that first net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the bottom net will fill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll weave it all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will get full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to let those branches start
growing up into that second net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fill it up to where you've got
one branch coming out of each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will grow up into the top
squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they hit the top squares you
want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a nice six to twelve inch
section of just rows of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rows of branches sticking straight
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost lollipop and bottom and
defoliate almost everything underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: that first net.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all gets cleaned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that larvae stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canopy isn't, the light's not going to
penetrate the canopy far enough to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that worth anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally clean all that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that bottom net is there to spread them
out and give them control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to spread the plant that would be
growing five feet tall straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got it three feet tall but it's also
spread five by five feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to fill in all that net
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to let it grow a little
bit vertically out of that until it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gets close to that next net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those branches that are sticking
straight up are going to turn into big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that will grow into that second net.
[SPEAKER_00]: That second net at that point is going to
work as a support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to be there to hold up all
of your giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often in a commercial environment
I've had to use a triple trellis and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes we have considered a fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all going to depend on your
genetics and what kind of lights you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we're using things like a rise
underneath Gavita lighting in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were getting serious growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a tent, you're only going to
need the spread net and then the one net
[SPEAKER_00]: up top for support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you want to use the trellis netting
and you don't want to work it into the net
[SPEAKER_00]: as far, if you just want to use it more
for a spread and not kind of create the
[SPEAKER_00]: scrog, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to work them as far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just put the net on and spread
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get one stick per branch if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to overcrowd anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is just to spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want to spread them,
make them shorter than they were tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use more of that vertical
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a long time ago by an author named
Eric Bixa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article was called Growing on the Grid
and it was exactly on this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talked about maximizing your growth
potential by utilizing the horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: space, not just the vertical space that
our plants try to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I should mention is that you
will not be able to move these plants once
[SPEAKER_00]: you put the trellis net on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to do this in whatever room
these plants will be flowering in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started the example by using a five by
five grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most cases we would veg in that five
by five, put up the scrog and then flower
[SPEAKER_00]: it in that five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are vegging and flowering in a
different environment, you will have to
[SPEAKER_00]: veg them, drag them to the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to put that trellis up on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them out nice and wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to work them
in too much, but you can kind of bend and
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate the plants a little bit without
causing any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the cracking technique I talked about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the branch, give it a little bit of a
twist and bend it over just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to create a little knuckle
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also create a nice smooth bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aim it any direction you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move it over to the section of the trellis
you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be very gentle with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them several days to recover before
you go back in and crack them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty much how we're forced to do
it in a commercial environment because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't veg and flower in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually have one large veg area and
multiple flowering rooms so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: keep perpetual cycles going.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, one of my
major goals is to harvest and refill a
[SPEAKER_00]: room in the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that doesn't sound like a big
challenge, but imagine if you've got 300
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a bunch of trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes half of the day to get it cut
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to clean the room spotless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then try to refill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we throw the net on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we spend the rest of the day just
spreading those plants out and adjusting
[SPEAKER_00]: that net to where those plants aren't too
angry with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my long sidetrack rambly talk
on sticks, cages, and trellis netting and
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple more quick things to
cover on this list of ways to improve our
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity while in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing on my list is integrated
pest management and scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably be applying a
preventative pesticide regimen to our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use a spray
application, now is the time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use predator bugs,
now is the time to order them and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared so that we have a nice colony
before we go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing a lot of growers overlook at
this stage of the game is manually
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your best tools in finding bugs in
your grow is your own eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend a little time walking through the
garden and just looking for pests or signs
[SPEAKER_00]: of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature really likes to give us hints that
there are problems in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every pest that comes in gives us some
kind of a warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are on top of your game,
you've got some yellow sticky traps
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging up and you are checking those on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will give you a fair warning that
you've got bugs coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how they'll tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be bugs stuck to the yellow
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much more obvious can it get?
[SPEAKER_00]: So check the yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then walk every row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every few feet, reach into the canopy and
grab a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any bugs on the underside of
the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any eggs on the underside of
the leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top side of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any stippling?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any honeydew?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is thrift damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see anything that just doesn't look
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a sign of overfeeding,
underfeeding or pH problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants and they will
tell you when something is starting to go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong and you won't need to panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scout on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for thrift damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go smack the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give a couple pots a good smack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anything fly out?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you've got fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really easy to treat if you find
them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach all of your helpers to scout for
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for spider mite webbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, look for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for anything that just doesn't look
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a crew leader, teach people how
to properly report the things that they
[SPEAKER_00]: see so they know when to come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, that doesn't look like a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach them what is a big deal and what is
not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always be on the lookout for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always be scouting and know what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for mites and mite damage
which is webbing, stippling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for thrift shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for thrift honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That glazy stuff on the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from your thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you tap the pots, those little black
things that fly up, those are fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you shake the leaves, those little
white bugs that fly out, those are white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of what you're looking for and
constantly be looking for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy plants will be much more vigorous
and much more productive than plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are fighting off insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, scouting is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost you anything to walk
through your grow and look for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on The Dude Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some Joe Rogan and just stroll
through the garden and go see what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go find the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are, there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to go find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll quit ranting about IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I've inspired you to go look for
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what else is free that will
really improve the quality of your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: overall is note taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when something goes wrong,
you know what to blame it on and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what not to do next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode on journaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to rant too much on that
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing to talk about and
then we're going to wrap up this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: because my throat is starting to burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way we can increase productivity
and vigor of our veg plants is to augment
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 levels in our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ambient CO2 level in your environment
is probably hovering somewhere between 300
[SPEAKER_00]: and 400 particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just about the standard on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my last research, depends on where you
are, your elevation, what kind of city
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in, but it's somewhere between 300
and 400 particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants would prefer somewhere around
1,000 particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take up to 1,200, maybe 1,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even seen people push them closer to
2,000 particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particles per million of CO2 and the
plants just explode with vigorous growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are several ways that you can
increase the CO2 in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I need to mention, once you
start increasing the amount of CO2 in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room environment, it is very
unhealthy for the plants to let the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: levels decline past what you have now
increased it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start boosting it to 1,000,
you either need to keep it at 1,000 or
[SPEAKER_00]: increase through flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is expecting the CO2 as a new
food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now feeding itself like it's got
another food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have now put your plant into another
level of high performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expecting to get that high
performance fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adjusted its diet accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut off that CO2, that extra CO2,
it will not be feeding itself properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will start seeing nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you keep up on your CO2 habit
if you start that habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you run out and the plants
start acting a little funny, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably what is causing it, is they're
still craving that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still trying to readjust their
metabolism because they're still in that
[SPEAKER_00]: high performance mode and they're not sure
what to do yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my last tip for increasing
performance and productivity and vigor of
[SPEAKER_00]: our veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared a lot of my dirty secrets,
a lot of the things that I use in my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows, a lot of things that I use
in the commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned something from my talk

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 374 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab of Sour Clem
Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it has 71.1% THC and a
total of 85.7% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have much more information on
the label here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from our friends at Apothecary
Farms in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Apothecary has recently
opened a Pueblo location, so make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I picked up the Sour Clem
Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is Sour Diesel and Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really sweet, delicious,
orangey, citrusy, clementine aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by a funky, sour diesel-y,
just nasty aroma in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say nasty, but I mean it in the best
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you dab it, it goes straight
to the brain and makes your eyes open wide
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you real rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this will be great podcast
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Apothecary
Farms, and an extra big shout out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really digging this batch of Sour Clem
Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's jump into a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do another Grow Lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a long series of Grow
Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new listener, I suggest you go
back to at least episode 351 and start on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow Lesson series.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're caught up,
welcome to the Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we are going to do a before flower
checkup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far in my Grow Lessons, we should have
healthy, happy veg plants that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: their final finishing pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested three, five, or seven-gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go larger, you do it your
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you've topped these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a nice canopy going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you've got a big, fat,
healthy root system going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're aiming for healthy, happy plants
that are thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we don't have any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you haven't over-fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you haven't had any pH issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we haven't had any
environmental problems that we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, everything's going well,
and you've got big, fat, healthy plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are almost ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably about knee-high at this
point, maybe a little bit taller,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what kind of lights you're
using, what kind of genetics you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, how often you've been
feeding them, what kind of treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are probably getting large
enough to consider putting them into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go into flower, I feel like
there are a few important points we should
[SPEAKER_00]: cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go over my before flower checkup.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it gets close to flower time,
one of the first things I think about is,
[SPEAKER_00]: do I have clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have clones for the next run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be self-sufficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you need to create clones for your
next run before you put your plants into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend taking clones from
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will teach you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that you get your
clones from your vegging plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you put your plants into flower,
do you have clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a way to supply plants for
your next cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on growing from seed again,
or if you plan on purchasing new clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from a friend or a dispensary or however
you get your clones, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to be self-sufficient,
now is the time to think about making
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from your current plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you decide that you want to be
self-sufficient, you've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to designate one of your
clones as a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the idea behind a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mother plant is a clone of a plant that
we have grown and tested and we know is
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that that plant is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it puts off a good harvest
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hopefully have learned that it is
pathogen and pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a reliable strain that we
want to keep around in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we do that is just by keeping
it in a vegetative stage perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can take clones from it as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you keep that mother plant in a
vegetative stage is by leaving it under at
[SPEAKER_00]: least 18 hours of light every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: For mother plants, sometimes I would
recommend 20 on and four off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for stubborn mother plants,
I may even go all the way up to 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a little bit about that in
previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also done a full episode about mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you check out episode 315 for a
full breakdown of mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you don't have room and space for
an extra plant, maybe you just can't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that extra plant because of your plant
count, because of state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is to clone off of your veg
plants perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will say that will create
something we used to call genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are healthy, I've done a
full episode on that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of taking clones from your veg
plants is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before you take them into the flower
room, take a couple of clones off of each
[SPEAKER_00]: of your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have faith in your clone taking
skills and you don't have room for an
[SPEAKER_00]: extra mother plant, this is an ideal way
to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some people may claim that this
will result in genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe in genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in it so much that I have
changed my vocabulary to where I call what
[SPEAKER_00]: is known as genetic drift to regenerative
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to learn more about it,
I recommend you listen to the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's episode number 343 and it's
actually titled genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you give it a listen and
understand why we now call it regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of that rant is to make sure
that you have got clones for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a supplier, a provider,
or a source for your next batch of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be really advantageous to take a
few clones, start vegging them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that way you've got another crop lined
up before you even have this one finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to max productivity of
your grow, you'll start running what is
[SPEAKER_00]: known as a perpetual grow where you use
two spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a veg space, you've got a
flowering space.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that flowering crop is done,
you cut it down, you clean the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you reset the room, and you drag a set of
flowering plants right back in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you never miss a beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That room never gets a break, so you're
always on top of production, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: you always have to have a supply of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have veg plants, you'll cut a
few clones off of them, you'll cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowering plants, you'll clean up
that room, drag those veg plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: into there, and then you'll start growing
those little clones up into the next
[SPEAKER_00]: batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to top them, you have to train
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a full nine weeks to get them
as big as you need them and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that flowering crop gets done that
you've got in the flowering room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut it down, clean it up, drag those
veg plants right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before you do that, you take a few
clones, so that you can keep the cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to create a perpetual cycle
for yourself, so you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never have to bring anything in from
outside, that way you can keep the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, that way you know if you get any
bugs or any pests, it's your fault,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't blame anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really limits the opportunities to
bring in problems, and it also helps you
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a relationship with one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run a perpetual grow with just one,
maybe two strains max, you can really dial
[SPEAKER_00]: those strains in, you can build a
relationship with them, and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get them to reach their full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to do perpetual
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it by swapping the whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it by having part of the room
harvest every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on that,
but I do plan to redo it in the future for
[SPEAKER_00]: a six plant count, because Colorado is now
limited to six plants for recreational or
[SPEAKER_00]: medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will do a revised perpetual grow
episode based on a six plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in listening to the
current or maybe the old scheduling a
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual grow episode, that is absolutely
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode number 73, I think it is a great
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of time and effort into
creating that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So episode 73, all about creating a
perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me get myself back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is to make sure you have got
either a source for clones or clones for
[SPEAKER_00]: your next run, and also it is always a
good idea to think about becoming more
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient, and you can do so by
creating a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing on my checklist that I
would think about in this brand new grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room, that we just recently built is do we
have any light leaks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have grow lights leaking out into
the outside and do we have outside lights
[SPEAKER_00]: leaking into the inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important to find out before
we go into the flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go in that grow room and turn
off the grow lights and sit in there for
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 or 20 minutes and let your eyes adjust
to the total darkness and see if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: any light at all in your flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see any light, that is too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not be able to see your hand in
front of your own face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be completely dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done an episode called total
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that one out also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any light leaks in the flowering phase are
going to cause your plants problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are either going to get no flowering
at all, you are going to get slow
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, or you are going to get
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get plants that will start to
flower and they will never finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you just may get crazy weird mutated
plants because of an odd light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in the grow room, turn off all the
grow lights, and just sit there for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your phone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have any light making your eyes do
weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let there be total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your eyes adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see any light, you need to
correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some of that silver foil tape or
maybe you need to fill the gaps with some
[SPEAKER_00]: caulk and cover it up with some duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just seal up all of those light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if your grow room is on an exterior
wall, meaning that wall is next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, or if there is a lot of activity
on the opposite side of the wall of which
[SPEAKER_00]: you are growing, I suggest you go in your
grow room and turn off the grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: during either the sunshine hours or the
busy hours of that room and see if any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the light from either the sun or that
adjacent room are leaking into your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room during their busy hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your grow room has a window and the sun
is shining on that window and the curtains
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't thick enough to block out that sun
or whatever you've put over that window is
[SPEAKER_00]: not thick enough to block out that
sunlight, we need to know that before we
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun may come up an hour before your
grow lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may start getting a full hour of
sunlight coming through that window that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're unaware of and that's going to
disrupt their flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there and check it all hours and
see if you are getting total darkness,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the hours you plan on putting
your plants in their night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that room is actually dark and
if it's not, correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing we need to do is the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go outside and make sure that
none of our grow room lights are leaking
[SPEAKER_00]: to the outside, especially if you're
running your grow lights during the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are lighting up the outside
neighborhood with your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those grow lights are going to bring
unwanted attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will bring thieves and law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're not leaking any light
out of your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is also a good time to start thinking
about when am I going to run my flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the lights on when it's dark
outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the lights on when it's light
outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity is cheaper during off peak
hours, which means when all the business
[SPEAKER_00]: is closed and everybody goes home,
electricity gets cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look on your bill and find out
when peak and off peak hours are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since electricity is more affordable at
off peak hours, many growers will choose
[SPEAKER_00]: to run their lights during those hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when the sun is not up, we don't
have to try to keep the room cool with the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights and the sun competing against
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun goes down, it automatically
gets a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside, you can fire up your grow lights
and you don't have as much heat to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a place that gets really
cold, you can run those grow lights at
[SPEAKER_00]: night and it will really help keep your
house warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small house and you run
the ducting right and you plan properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know several East Coast growers that
used to keep their apartments warm by
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up a four or six hundred watt
light in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would kick out a small winter crop of
super potent cannabis out of their very
[SPEAKER_00]: small apartment and they would also use
that same light to keep themselves warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very efficient way to do
things back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is a good time to start thinking
about when you're going to run your lights
[SPEAKER_00]: in your flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have to go to work part of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want those lights to come on right
when you get home from work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want those lights to come on so you
can work on the plants before you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of things to plan and
think about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you work on the plants after
work because you don't want to go to work
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling like dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people work a day job nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to go to work and then
you'll get off hopefully in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come home, work on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works out really well because you are
now on off peak electricity hours and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not fighting that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to run as much electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get off work, come home,
work on the plants and you can take a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you don't stink for work next day and
nobody knows that you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a place you need to keep it
on the down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm talking about being careful
and keeping it on the down low,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a carbon filter set up as your
filtration in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready for a stinky crop of
flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: In just a few weeks, these plants are
going to start stinking very heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a nice aroma around 20 days
in, depending on your genetics and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using for nutrients and the airflow
in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to order a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already, you need to get
that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get it in place and you need
to start controlling the aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I need to back up and cover one thing
that I overlooked when I was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were using vented lights,
which means you have got a light with
[SPEAKER_00]: glass between the bulb and the plant
canopy and that's all sealed up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a duct coming off of one end
and off of the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're blowing a blower over it to get
that heat from the light out of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will run that ducting to
the outside of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll run it out of a window just to
make it go outside of the house somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the sunshine will reflect
right down that ducting and come into your
[SPEAKER_00]: light reflector and work just like a
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were channeling that light down that
ducting right into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were not doing that while the
lights are on, you were lighting up the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and disrupting your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were using ducted hoods and you
were running that to the outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, you may need to adjust the duct to
where the light does not make it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the inside of that ducting
is quite often made with a very reflective
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to have to give it a
lot of bends or you'll have to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: baffle at the end of it toward the light
is not allowed to even enter down that
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is to get a can of flat
black spray paint and spray paint the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside as far as you can make that spray
paint go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a nice little black layer in
there and take that reflective layer off
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will prevent the light from
getting in there as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still may need to make a bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to put some sort of light
baffle over it, but please check and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if the light is coming through your ducted
hoods and disrupting your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunshine will make it so far down that
ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be amazed and just one little
speckle of sunlight will completely
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupt your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think the plants are in the dark
and they're getting that one little
[SPEAKER_00]: pinprick of sunlight, they're not in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also take a quick look at all of the
equipment in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your air conditioner have blue and
red lights on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something in the grow room that's
illuminating a blue display?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any lights in there,
you need to put some tape or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a flap over it so that light does not
disrupt your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only color of light that is acceptable
during the night cycle is a green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are still situations where I
have seen those green lights cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with people's plants by running
that green light too much during a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer it be completely dark in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it as dark as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it scary dark and then a little
bit darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want us to be able to see your
hand in front of your face when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: touching your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how dark we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've done an episode called total
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give that one a listen if you don't
understand why total darkness is so
[SPEAKER_00]: important in our indoor grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing on my pre flower checklist
is can you correctly identify females
[SPEAKER_00]: males and hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running from seed, especially
you have got the option to run into
[SPEAKER_00]: females, males or hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to identify these very
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a male in the garden,
it needs to be cold immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come across a hermaphroditic plant
early in flower, you need to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like so you can get it out of
the grow room before it causes you
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to start showing sex
somewhere around 10 days into flower by
[SPEAKER_00]: day 12 or 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be really obvious if you've got
male or female plants by day 12 or 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: your female plants will be able to receive
pollen from the male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not paying attention,
sometimes by day 10 or 12, a male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can open up and start dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your whole crop is pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to have seeds in it
and you didn't even know because you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get to this risky phase,
open up some books, do some Google
[SPEAKER_00]: searches and learn to identify a female
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to confidently identify a male
cannabis plant and learn how to identify a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that shows both sexes and the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, I plan to talk about
phenohunting and selecting a mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from that phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that episode, I will also include a
talk about sexing our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very important at this phase and
this stage of the game so we need to know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to confidently identify males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be able to provide you detailed
descriptions, but I recommend you look
[SPEAKER_00]: online for pictures of males and females
of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you look a few times, it will become
very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to develop the confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will include a talk about it on the
next episode, but you will still need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go look in a book or look online and get a
good visual understanding of what you are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for so you can spot it right away
if something should pop up in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing you should think about
before you put your plants into flower is,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you burned them with nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they nutrient deficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: We may want to get them a little healthier
before you put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want these plants as healthy as we can
get them before they go into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important thing to think about is,
do you have any pest infestations?
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't able to spray the plants with as
many products once we get buds set,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we want to eradicate any pest problems
before we go into flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have a pest problem at this
time, it is time to step up the frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sprays and quite possibly increase
the potency of your sprays if not start
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing new products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want to enter the flowering
phase with a known pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier to combat a pest problem
while in veg, so let's focus on getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of any problems now and then we can
move to flower a week late if that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to do or we can adjust our plans
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's make sure to get rid of every
bug before we move to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we should have some
backup clones for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the room is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there are no light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no light getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no light getting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our aroma control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no stinky air getting out of the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the number one way people get in
trouble is by having stinky air coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control that aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are allowed to grow cannabis in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just fine until somebody comes in
and says, and says they can smell your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, they send out an
investigator and they come knock on your
[SPEAKER_00]: door and ask to look and see how many
plants you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got too many plants,
you do get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter how many plants you've got,
I recommend you've got some sort of odor
[SPEAKER_00]: control so none of your neighbors get mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody snitches on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody comes knocking on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you are within your legal amount
of plants, it is still nerve wracking and
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful to have to deal with law
enforcement because of your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply control that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control the odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we've got clones for the next
round.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are controlling the odor that is
leaving our room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to identify males,
females, and hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to call so that we don't
cause any problems in the grow so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't seed up our whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there are no pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we haven't overfed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are almost ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we know when to flower these
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things that will
help us determine when to initiate the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main factors will be the
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much ceiling space do you have in your
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are in a residential area.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are going to be modifying a
bedroom or something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us may be using grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to flower your plants
at a height to where they have plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: room to grow to where they don't work
themselves into the lights and you run out
[SPEAKER_00]: of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to plan to leave, depending on
what type of light you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to plan to leave an appropriate
gap between the top of your plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: your light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using LEDs, you can get much
closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the ceramic metal halides,
you can get kind of close.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a high pressure sodium
light, you need to stay kind of a distance
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a double-ended Gavita,
you need to stay even further away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan for that when you're planning your
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a good thing to think of when you are
new at growing and you haven't grown a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of crops and you want to prepare for
flowering time and have enough space is
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare for your plants to double in
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were growing a sativa strain or
something, a sativa hybrid with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa genetics in there, it could double
in height throughout the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you vege your plant and the plant is
three feet tall, you initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time it is done, you can expect a
six foot tall plant if you're not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to control that vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, I would plan to flower
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got, if your light is six feet
tall, we're going to say if your light is
[SPEAKER_00]: seven feet tall because we need some
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your light is seven feet off the
ground, I would vege those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I grow them, I would vege
them until they are three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they are three feet tall,
initiate the flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to double in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll end about six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll still have that one foot of space
between the light and the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not a rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not grown your strain before,
if you don't know what these genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do, allow yourself room for these
plants to double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you ve got plants with big
obvious fat-wide indica leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may not get that doubled growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may only get a little bit of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get stretch for about
three weeks and then they'll slow down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the stretching and the bud sets will
really set in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to plan ahead for too much head
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing worse than having a big,
giant, beautiful top cola that is just
[SPEAKER_00]: beefy and covered in trichomes and then it
starts murdering itself by growing
[SPEAKER_00]: directly into your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts touching the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts burning itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts getting ugly colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think about, do I want to bend
that bud over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I actually want to cut part of that
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do at this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan ahead and try to give yourself
plenty of head space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the plants touching each
other too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about if you and I and another
couple of dudes were hanging out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room, if we all just started spreading our
arms around, just touching each other all
[SPEAKER_00]: weird, you're going to get kind of weirded
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, bro, why are you touching me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to want your own space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: When one plant feels another plant touch
it, it indicates to itself, I probably
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't grow much further that way
because I'm already touching a limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other plant says the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got two plants that have
just stopped out branching and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allow your plants plenty of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do want to maximize canopy space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do want to maximize the space of our
grow, but we don't want to crush them in
[SPEAKER_00]: so much we can't get airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to crush them in so much
that they're uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a little bit of airflow and we
don't want leaves stacking on top of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other because that's where you start
causing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space your plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them some breathing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them some growing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that when you put your
plants into the flowering phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are only halfway through their life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still need to bush out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow much taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only halfway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allow that extra space for flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're running a screen of green
or a trellis system, I suggest you veg
[SPEAKER_00]: until you kind of fill out most of that
screen system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to try to get one little
branch coming through each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: squares in your trellis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can maximize that, that's when you
really start cranking out as much bud as
[SPEAKER_00]: you can produce in your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suggest you fill that canopy up and
fill that screen up before you flower
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're spreading it out nice and
wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going straight up like the guys
without the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spreading it out, you've still
got all that vertical growth left for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spread it out, then put it into
flower and it's going to grow vertically
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend you use all of that screen
space to the best of your ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is a good explanation of
when to flower the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give yourself about double the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to allow some space between the
lights and the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also want to give the plants some
space so they can breathe and so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've done any topping,
I would definitely recommend 10 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: of recovery time before you move the
plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all of your topping plenty of time in
advance of the plants can heal so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: redistribute the hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, the plant can produce big fat
chunky top buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you top a plant and move it into flower
too soon, you'll notice those top buds
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really produce the colas that we're
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give your plant time to recover from
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let those hormones move around and it will
make a huge difference in the productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that is a pretty good
before flower checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the plants are healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you understand how to find
males, females and hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure you've got a good idea of
when to flower those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to set a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to stick to it as long as you are pest
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that you keep twisting and
popping the stems, making those stocks
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and robust until it's time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep pulling off any yellow or funky
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the plants looking nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's time to flower, flip that
timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a note of what day you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you are in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several people have asked me when
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does flowering start the day you change
the timer to 1212 or does flowering start
[SPEAKER_00]: the day you start seeing buds set?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking at a package of seeds
and it says these seeds will take eight to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 weeks to flower, that eight to 10 weeks
starts the day you change your timer to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you do the flip is the beginning
of your flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when that new schedule,
that new calendar, the new countdown,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is when that begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were running 24 hours or 20 on,
and four off or 18 and six in veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just go in and you change that timer
to 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is day one of your flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about 10 to 12 days, you'll start
seeing pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will start showing you sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go through and start pulling
out all of the boys by this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 14, the boys will be very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be getting ready to pollinate if
they have not already dropped pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention to the boys and get
them out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first two or three weeks,
of flowering, you're going to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily on looking for male plants and
plants with hermaphrodite traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: removing them from the garden safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I suggest that you start now
doing some research on understanding what
[SPEAKER_00]: a male and a female and a hermaphrodite
cannabis plant look like so that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are eight, 10, 12 or 14 days into flower,
you are certain what you see and you are
[SPEAKER_00]: confident so that you can make the correct
decision to keep your garden in top shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like that is a great
place to stop because my next lesson is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be about phenohunting and sexing
the plants and selecting a mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from that phenohunt process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to work our way into the
flowering stage of the grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, it is almost time to flower
the hypothetical plants in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk in depth about probably three
week chunks of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably do week one through three
and then we'll do four through six and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll do seven through nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard for my brain to process that
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is my idea for the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to break it down into three,
three week chunks and then we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about finishing the plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like this is a great place to
wrap up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.

[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Ashley and until next
time, take a fat dab and give your mom a
[SPEAKER_00]: hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 376 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that I start the
podcast off by letting you know what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a dab of some strawberry
diesel batter from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is 61.9% THC with a
total of 73.7% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff has a really funky sort of a
sour strawberry smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely got the strawberries with
a hint of diesel coming through the
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted like strawberry incense and I
really liked the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is just hanging out on my
tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could use a drink, but I don't want to
drink anything to wipe that strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor off of my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let that linger as long as it
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really digging the flavor and the
high is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes straight to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice high energy sort of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the strawberry diesel batter
from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get right into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is going to be another grow
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know I've been doing a long series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be about
phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far in my series of grow lessons,
we have talked about setting a goal for
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have chosen a wise spot for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have selected and purchased the proper
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have actually sprouted seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've acquired clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got little baby plants going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We potted those into our three or five,
maybe seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently in the veg phase in my
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have topped our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some canopy control techniques
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are almost ready to flower in my grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the flowering phase,
I feel like there are a few things we
[SPEAKER_00]: should understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know how to sex our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing from seed, you've got
the opportunity to find males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants won't reveal their sex until
we are early in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to identify the male
plants so that we can remove them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden before they pollinate our females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we're going to talk about is
selecting mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do that through a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right in to talking about a
phenohunt and what a phenohunt is and what
[SPEAKER_00]: is the purpose of phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do I mean by a phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say a phenohunt, I am referring to
finding a desired phenotype from a package
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's say you acquired a package of
seeds from the Helidank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend 10 seeds for a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do sell packs of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell packs of five to make them
attainable so that everybody can afford
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand not everybody can buy a 10
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend 10 seeds for a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation, we're going to run
10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got a fresh 10 pack of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find that phenotype that works
best for you and your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sifting through those seeds is a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grow them out and you're
going to find the phenotype that works
[SPEAKER_00]: best for you, the phenotype that works
best for your patients or your customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also you need the phenotype that works
best for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal here is to find a custom
tailored phenotype out of this pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a little bit how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a phenohunt is one of my favorite
things to do in a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to do a lot of observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to find surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find that next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find the next golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find the next gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find the next Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you could come up with
in a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my favorite parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like opening Christmas presents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what is in that box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly I want to make a Forrest Gump
reference because you never know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how I would do a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would germinate those 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would carefully make sure that every one
of those plants is treated the exact same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put them all in the same medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed them the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would go under the same light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would be all in the same
environment because I don't want any
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all of these seedlings to get the
same opportunity to show me the same
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I germinate these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start taking notes on these plants very
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I label them 1 through 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got whatever the strain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say Arise 1, Arise 2,
all the way up to number 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pay attention to these plants
and take a long lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see anything weird, I'm going to
document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a plant that's just growing like
shit, it's not keeping up, it's having
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, it gets pulled out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to keep a shitty plant
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to have a shitty plant
when you can phenohunt seeds and find a
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll pay close attention to my plants
as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a lot of notes and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I top the plants, if I lollipop the
plants, I make sure to do it equally
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all 10 of these seedlings to get
the same treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we want them all to have the same
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to audition these to find the
best one for our situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you give them different treatment,
they're going to come out differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know what the best one is?
[SPEAKER_00]: They all need to be treated equally in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grow these plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they're big enough,
I take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am confident in my cloning skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.9% of my clones will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not confident in your clone
skills, I suggest you take two,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three, maybe five clones from each
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them get large enough to provide
the amount of clones you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a clone from each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully label your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have Arise number one,
Arise number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have clone Arise one,
clone Arise two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be very important in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you are going to keep your
plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to segue into selecting a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we're going to have a mother
plant to keep these genetics around
[SPEAKER_00]: forever so you can continue to produce
this select phenotype until the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone that we labeled is going to
become your future mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure it is labeled accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we label them Arise one,
Arise two, all the way up to Arise number
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also label the clones A one,
A two, A all the way up to number 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the clone donor and the
corresponding clones properly labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no confusion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have done a complete episode
on cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need help cutting your clones,
I recommend episode number 346 for an
[SPEAKER_00]: in-depth lesson on cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want a really in-depth talk
about mother plants, check out episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 315.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will teach you all about healthy
and happy mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is to get a clone off of
each of these seedlings before we put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when we find the champion out of
this batch, we've got a clone of that so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can continue to grow that clone
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep that one clone alive as a mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never flower it out and you can cut
clones from that as long as you keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always there to give you clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have now got a mother plant from your
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your custom phenotype that is for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like the more sativa dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like the phenotype that smells
more like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you like the phenotype that smells
more like dirty feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need the one that finishes
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're the kind of person that likes
to let them flower for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to find that one that works best
for you in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a clone, you've got a clone
that all of your other friends have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the neighborhood has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing setting you apart from the
competition if you were growing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: retail market purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing from seed, you could find gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing from seed, you can also find that
custom phenotype that works for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that works for your garden, and that works
for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, when you're growing from
seed, I always recommend taking a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: because who knows what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you grow from seed and you find
the most amazing product you've ever found
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't have a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to try to re-veg it,
which is a whole other podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have got a clone, it's already
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut a clone before you put your
plants into flower, that clone is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go into a pot about two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'll be ready to go into another pot
a couple of weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut a bunch more clones off of
that and have that ready to go by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: that first crop is finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have decided which one is the
keeper probably around week seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, and you can take a bunch of clones
and have them ready almost on time to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: that room when you cut down from the
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to skip any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you move along quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now our original plants have grown out
nice and large.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got clones from everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are properly labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are confident that at least one of
those clones from each phenotype is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it is time to flower my phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the fun begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell a lot about our plants during
the veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell if you like the growth
structure if you like the node spacing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like the leaf size, that's going to
indicate a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real things we want to see will not
reveal themselves until they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early in flower, the first things we
need to pay attention to, we need to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from seed, you've got
the opportunity to have males pop up in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden, even if you are running
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all feminized seed makers make seeds
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some feminized seeds were made with poor
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some feminized seeds were made without
auditioning the parrot plants properly
[SPEAKER_00]: before breeding with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still may find males or intersex
traits in feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the package says feminize
doesn't mean you can get lazy and stop
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to look for males or
hermaphrodites in our garden early in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start looking day three,
day four, day five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start seeing signs of male
pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you are certain, that that
plant is a male, it needs to come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want boys in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girls are going to start developing
pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those males drop pollen, they're
going to seed your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the boys out as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan to talk more in depth about
sexing our plants in a future episode when
[SPEAKER_00]: we get into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But quickly, let's talk about identifying
a male and a female cannabis plant early
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I am trying to identify the sex of a
cannabis plant, there are two spots I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to look and I find those spots very
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very tip-top bud will be the first
spot to show you sex when you throw those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, lower on the plant where you've got
an intersection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the little peace sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two branches coming off and
you've got the main stalk coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there at that intersection,
it loves to tell you if it is a boy or a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few days into flower, our plants will
start giving us signs of male or female
[SPEAKER_00]: sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grab a branch and look closely,
there will be the main branch coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there will be a little shoot coming
off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where that shoot splits off, there will be
signs of sex right at that intersection,
[SPEAKER_00]: right inside of that little V.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be signs of sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a wart-like thing popping up
right there, if you see a little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: acorn popping up right there, if it's got
a ball coming out of there, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like it's got a hair coming
out, just one little pistol, maybe two
[SPEAKER_00]: little pistol hairs doing a peace sign,
that is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the intersections, at the nodes,
you will see either little hairs coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out or you may see what looks like balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now be careful in early flower because
sometimes those little balls are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: calyxes and it can be confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have identified something that
you think may be a male flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: mark that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, a rise number seven looks like it
could be a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that down somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every day when you go in that
garden, head right over to number seven
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those balls, that are on the plant,
start drooping and hanging down,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is definitely a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing a set of balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get that boy out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that ball starts putting out a long
hair, that is a calyx and you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up toward the top of the plant,
we should see a little bit of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will either see buds that look like
dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're getting hairs, the white furry
pistols are popping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like you're making little sets
of bananas up at the top, those are your
[SPEAKER_00]: boy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may look like you've got a little bud
that is already loaded up with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get that boy out of the room
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only describe males and females so
much through words with a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility as a ganja
farmer to Google what a male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ahead of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look before you put your plants into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not make the mistake of thinking,
I can identify a male plant and then let
[SPEAKER_00]: that male go.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 10, day 14, he's going to be
dropping pollen and you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, that is very
discouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything just went to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main goal is to produce a crop with
no seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just reduced potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just reduced harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely reduced retail value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is not how you want it if
you've got seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful to get the boys out
very, very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were observing your plants and
your plants show ball sacks and they show
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs, they need to go immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are hermaphrodite plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's 2018 and we're supposed to be
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not accept hermaphroditic plants in
my garden for any reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to produce high grade
seedless cannabis and a hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to ruin our whole goal of a
seedless garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of the males and get rid of the
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not sure if that plant is a
male or hermaphrodite, pay very close
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on that part you think may be
a male part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you plenty of warning that it
wants to release pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you've culled your boys and you
think you are past the part of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: revealing sex, if you are growing from
seed, you still need to pay attention for
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon for things to reveal
intersex traits late in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime around week seven or week eight
or especially week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you push them real hard,
it's way likely to see them toward week
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the hermaphrodite
traits in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant shows herm late in flower,
you've got some considerations to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it didn't pop up until week nine,
that may be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that weed is fire, if you just produce
some amazing product and that plant herms
[SPEAKER_00]: late in the bloom cycle, that may be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut the plants down before
that hermaphrodite is able to cause us any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of the hermaphrodite plants
that show intersex traits late in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: produce sterile male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't even produce pollen that can
pollinate a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pop out a couple of nanners and
they'll dry up immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't ever produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a plant that does hermaphrodite
late in flower, if it's not going to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and it produces amazing product,
it may be worth keeping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something for you to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you ever share that clone with
people, maybe let them know, hey bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of week nine, this one might
throw a couple of nanners on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an experienced grower, that's something
I'm familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I can deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very many of the chem dog derived strains
will herm on you if you let them go past
[SPEAKER_00]: nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it go too long, it'll throw out
a couple of nanners, but those nanners
[SPEAKER_00]: don't contain any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not pollinate anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just pop up a couple of male
bananas right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to solve that, either cut it
down right before that happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know when it happens,
it happens at day 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut them down about day 68.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also grown that plant enough to
know that those male flowers don't produce
[SPEAKER_00]: any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if I do let it finish,
if I let it go 70, 72 days, it's still not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if they did spit out pollen,
I'm 72 days in the flower, there's no time
[SPEAKER_00]: for anything to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my pistols have been shriveled up
by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere for that pollen to be
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have things to consider if your
plants are hermaphroditing late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's early in flower, call them,
get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an obvious hermaphrodite,
toss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've just got one flower late in,
I would think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got one hermaphrodite
flower late in and that plant is only a
[SPEAKER_00]: six on a scale of 10, you still call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a nine or a 10 and a
hermaphrodite flower, that's when you kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, is it worth that one herm or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is a grower's decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a quick rant on sexing your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan on going into more depth on that
in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were looking for the little hairs or
the balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got balls, it's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got hairs and balls, it definitely
has to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once we call the males and the
potential hermaphrodites, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: probably got 40 to 60 percent of your
remaining stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants average about 50 percent
male and 50 percent female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by day 14, you have probably eliminated
40 to 60 percent of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you started with 10 seeds, you were
probably down to about five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have six, you may have four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go with five for the rest of
this lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got five plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in their finishing pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about two weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've pulled out all the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've pulled out all the hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still paying attention for intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also keeping a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything you feed these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down everything you spray on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the reactions of the plants to
those procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see one plant do something
different than all of the others as a
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction to something you did,
document that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may mean a lot to you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that plant one and plant five
become the two best keepers out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to narrow it down to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that weird note you wrote about
plant number one will be the reason you
[SPEAKER_00]: call that one and the reason you keep
number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do plan to do in-depth lessons on
each week of the bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to break it down into
trimesters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do weeks one through three,
four through six, and seven through nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fast forward a little bit
through the growth cycle here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get toward the end of
the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the grow phase, during the bloom
phase, our plants got the same exact
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only got five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been fairly easy to treat
them all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the same amount of lollipopping,
the same type of pruning, the same type of
[SPEAKER_00]: topping, the exact same feedings,
the exact same pest management,
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same foliar feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treated them all the same so that we
can see reliable outcomes from each
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just like any crop, make sure you
flush for 10 to 14 days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a long and in-depth episode on
harvesting and drying and curing our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need tips on drying and curing your
freshly harvested cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you listen to episode 326,
titled, Drying and Curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you a detailed step-by-step
lesson on drying and curing your freshly
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got to flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then dry it and cure it and trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what you get to do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to have a smoke party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how much you grew,
depending on how many people you trust and
[SPEAKER_00]: how many friends you've got, you get to
have a few people come over and test your
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most fun and rewarding
parts of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started with 10 seeds about 120 days
ago, and now you've got a small group of
[SPEAKER_00]: close friends at your house helping you
narrow it down to decide what plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be part of your future grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you and your friends are
narrowing down which phenotype to select,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to make the final decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anybody sway you on the final
decision because you are the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the one doing the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I like to do is after everything
is dried and cured and we're ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it, I get Mike over, I get Kevin
over, I bring a couple other folks over,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I give them five little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we've got time to do it,
we'll smoke them all right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just take a couple bong rips of each
or whatever and see what it all tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: like, see what it smells like,
and look for what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for a specific aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for a specific effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for bag appeal?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing, like I said earlier,
if you are a retail market grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably going for some bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need the buds that look
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may want something that is
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something that smells like
oranges or strawberries or blueberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've all got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something that smells like
oranges and gas and cherries and dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: feet and gets you high as fuck and
finishes in 60 days, you just found gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the one you want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, find the one that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your friends do a little tasting and
let them kind of vote on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may agree, they may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just great to have input from your
friends and it's always a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little pheno hunt party with the
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's a quick breakdown of a pheno
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main point is to find the outlier in a
population of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do so by germinating a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that process, we remove the problematic
plants, which may be males,
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites, or mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, we take clones before we flower our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carefully label those plants to match
the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got plant one and clone one,
plant two and clone two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when we're done, we've got
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that a little
more in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've popped seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've removed the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we flower out our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that process, take a lot of notes so
you know what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have fuzzy memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke before I work in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, I may forget some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I write down everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That notepad isn't going to forget
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Google document won't forget
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My high ass will probably forget a couple
of details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write your shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, finish the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little smoke test with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide which one you like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: What works for your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works for your clientele?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing for a medical patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works best for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get the opportunity, I like to send
my finished products to a lab for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be surprised at how many plants
we select as the keeper that are not the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest tester in the batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, the highest tester isn't the
one with the best flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, the one with the highest test
does not bring the best high when you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, those lab results are
impressive, but we did not choose the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that gave us the best result based on our
smoke test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, we did choose the one that
matches up with the test, but not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more common that we don't agree
with the lab test as which one is our
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you're going to find when
you do a phenohunt, you will find two that
[SPEAKER_00]: you really, really want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be one that smells real well and
smokes real well and gets you super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be one that does all of that
pretty well, but it harvests way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a grower, that's always hard to
decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always keep the one that smokes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just grow more next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to select because it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to select because it harvests the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to select based on effect,
based on potency, based on desirability,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on marketability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough bullshit out there that
looks really good on Instagram and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, even if your plants aren't super
photogenic, if they do what you need when
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke them, when you and your market
consume them, that's exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is the phenotype you want to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a custom phenotype for you,
your clientele, and your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, earlier I mentioned mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took clones off of these plants before
we flowered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in a grow room somewhere, we've got
five plants just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you were proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you decided around week seven that
you really liked Arise number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you went in there and you found that
Arise mother plant number three and you
[SPEAKER_00]: took 10 clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting big so that as soon as you
harvest, you can throw those plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and you can run Arise number three
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you were waiting for this smoke test
to find out which one to run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you have got that number that
you decide that plant is hanging out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to go get it and take a bunch
of clones off of it and run it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you narrowed it down to two that you
like, cut a few clones off of each one,
[SPEAKER_00]: run them again side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you've got a larger batch of each
one to decide from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe change the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe change something in the room and see
if the two phenotypes do something
[SPEAKER_00]: different with different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will help you decide on which
one to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you choose to do it after your
tasting party with your friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that backup plant in the veg
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Arise number three just over
there waiting to take a bunch of clones so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow it again forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the thing is, keep that plant alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to that episode about mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can keep that Arise number three
around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have reliable, consistent medicine
that works for you, that works for your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, and your people will learn to rely
on you for that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, that is my quick
talk on pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made that nice and clear for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pheno hunting is one of my favorite things
to do and to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to find out what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You narrow it down to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a guy like me, as soon as you're down
to that one, you start another pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm always adding a new one and
pulling an old one out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something coming in and
something going out so that I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: got some fresh stuff in my grows.
