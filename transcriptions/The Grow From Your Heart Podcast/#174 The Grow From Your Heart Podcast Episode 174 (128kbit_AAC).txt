[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am coming to you
on a frosty, cold Colorado evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about seven degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's about a foot of snow out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is miserable.

podcast with you guys.

[SPEAKER_03]: Our friend Bobo Blasterco and Lindsey
stopped by this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came and had a little mini afternoon
sesh with me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while they were here, Bobo mentioned
that he was just wearing that hoodie,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he did not have on a heavy jacket or
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said he was nice and warm and cozy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ladies and gentlemen, it was fucking
cold and nasty out there today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those hoodies are super cozy.
[SPEAKER_03]: These hoodies are nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel all snuggly in it, and it looks
great on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can look great on you also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get
through that ad, and then I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: shift directions here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some terrible news.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn on the music for this
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a podcast, so I can't do too long of
a moment of silence.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to take a very brief moment
of silence for a very important member of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis community that we have lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a seed company known as the
Greenhouse Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were one of the very first and
largest seed companies and coffee shops in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouse Seed Company is founded and
mostly led by a man by the name of Arjen
[SPEAKER_03]: Roskam, who was a great man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a cannabis breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a traveler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arjen's partner in crime, his best friend,
his cohort, his cannabis compadre was a
[SPEAKER_03]: young man by the name of Franco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I hate to report that
Franco unfortunately passed away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Franco contracted malaria while in the
Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Franco was in the Congo, in the jungle of
the Congo, trying to get trying to do
[SPEAKER_03]: research and get CBD to people who have
contracted malaria.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was there trying to get CBD medicine to
folks who contracted malaria and he got
[SPEAKER_03]: cerebral malaria himself and he passed
from the malaria.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a very brief moment of
silence here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This blink of silence is for Franco.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, much respect to Franco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Franco was a strain hunter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Franco was a ganja farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Franco was a wonderful man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a great dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had great energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see, if you go to, I think it's
just Franco's Strain Hunter on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you look at all of his pictures,
he always has a smile.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always hugging somebody or a cannabis
plant in every single one of his pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Franco loved strain hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Franco loved traveling the world in search
of the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find a lot of video footage of
Franco on the Strain Hunter video series
[SPEAKER_03]: from Greenhouse Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you watch those videos, you will see
Franco's passion for cannabis and you will
[SPEAKER_03]: see the friendship between Simon and
Franco and Aryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a magical friendship and it is a huge
loss to the cannabis community to lose a
[SPEAKER_03]: man like Franco.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that I can do to make myself
feel better and maybe this will make you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel better too is we lost a whole bunch
of notable musicians, actors, comedians
[SPEAKER_03]: and notable folks in the past few years
and now wherever those people have
[SPEAKER_03]: congregated, wherever you believe people
go when they pass, now they've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: quality ganja farmer growing ganja for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you and I get to the great gig in
the sky, Franco will be there with the fat
[SPEAKER_03]: one rolled waiting for us and a big old
hug, he'll be there to greet you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big shout out to Franco, a big hug in
much respect to the entire Greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds family and also a big hug to
everybody who's touched by Franco and has
[SPEAKER_03]: a tear in their eye because of this news.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right you guys, I'm gonna try to shift
gears and we're going to do a product
[SPEAKER_03]: review.
[SPEAKER_03]: I quite often ask if people would like to
have a product reviewed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All they need to do is send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com and I
can teach you how to get your product in
[SPEAKER_03]: my hand and I will review it here on the
show for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My latest product I have got for review
today is a grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was sent to me by Chop Shop Grinders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Chop Shop Grinders.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a nice grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a nice black shine to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the Chop Shop Grinders logo on
the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very similar to most grinders.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has got a top piece that you lift open.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put your flower product in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put the lid back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give it a good spin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's got a part you unscrew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm unscrewing it as I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a nice mesh screen in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where your ground flower ends up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says to grind it coarse to leave it one
direction for a fine grind to flip it
[SPEAKER_03]: upside down and grind it that way for a
finer grind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then of course it's got this little screen
here to where on the bottom you can
[SPEAKER_03]: actually catch the keef.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a keef catching kind of guy you
can put that in your bowls or you can put
[SPEAKER_03]: that on your joints or you can do whatever
you want with your keef.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of uses for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of puts me on a side rant,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called a pollen catch is what this
portion of the grinder is, but keef is not
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that call keef pollen, you are
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pollen comes from male plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no pollen in your female plants
unless something went horribly wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you are not catching pollen that is
keef.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are mainly trichomes that you were
gathering on the bottom there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can gather those up and put them on a
bowl or you can put them in a joint or if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to wrap a little bit out of
wax around a joint you can also put that
[SPEAKER_03]: keef on the outside of the wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically trichomes that have
fallen off of your buds, but it is not
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen so please quit calling that pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get back to this grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I do like about this grinder is
it is super light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got another grinder that I carry in
my backpack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has replaced the backpack
grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got these really, one thing I
complain about grinders is they get stuck
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you get some material in there they
start getting a little sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has little, I want to call them
just finger indentions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just little grippies for your
fingers to where it's not going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I will always be able to spin
this grinder because of the little finger
[SPEAKER_03]: grippies on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sharp stone grinder, it got stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never going to get it undone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've got a chop shop grinder to use
and it will not get stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can rely on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to put a couple of flowers in
here and we're going to smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I do that, I've already got one
tiny complaint about this grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only complaint I have is that it's too
small.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing is probably three inches in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got two nuggets sitting here that I
plan on rolling into one joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to grind both of my buds
separately because they will not fit in
[SPEAKER_03]: this grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may not be everybody's problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody may not have giant buds or too
much weed for their grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a guy like myself, I'm going to have
to put, I'm going to have to run this
[SPEAKER_03]: grinder twice just to get these buds
ground up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of semi-breaking up this first
bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a stem in the middle I'm taking
out, but now I've got this grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top portion is pretty full.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm putting the little lid on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give it a grind into the mic
so you can hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it took.
[SPEAKER_03]: This weed is pretty much ground up,
ready to roll into a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give it a couple more twists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take the top off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm just going to put the other nug in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to give it a little pre-break.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm grinding up is called Burning
Spear.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Girl Scout Cookies, the Forum cut
of Girl Scout Cookies pollinated by a
[SPEAKER_03]: reversed Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Forum Cookies to Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a Femini seed that I grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not put these seeds out to the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave a few of them to Spence from the
Garden of Weeden for his birthday one
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the only one that got seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure he gifted a couple of
those to another grower friend because I
[SPEAKER_03]: saw pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spence and that one dude are the only
people that really got seeds of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells very Girl Scout Cookies-y,
but once you start grinding it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it releases a Chem Dog fuel, funk,
dirty feet sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like if you hid your bag of
Girl Scout Cookies weed in a dirty sock in
[SPEAKER_03]: a good way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got it nice and ground up here in
this Chop Shop grinder, which I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grind, the consistency and texture
that it ground is perfect for a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too coarse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did it the normal way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says for a coarser grind to flip it
upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stuck two papers together because I like
to roll fat joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I made myself a little tip here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put that in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to dump the dope into here and
give it a twist and a lick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to smoke a joint together
while we do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to lick it and twist it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't hear me rambling while I lick
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the twist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to tuck that corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key to rolling a good joint is just
getting that first corner tuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give it a lick right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I do, you guys might think I'm
crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lick the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't lick the gummed part because I
feel like you just drag that gummed part
[SPEAKER_03]: around and you waste it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My joints tend to stick a lot better if I
lick the outside and moisten that gum and
[SPEAKER_03]: don't lick it off with my tongue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I light this joint, I should
conclude my grinder review, Chop Shop
[SPEAKER_03]: grinder review.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit small, but the small
size is okay because of how light it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a much better backpack grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ground my weed perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the little pollen catch that is
actually a keif catch on the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came with a little scooper so that when
I do have a nice collection, I can scoop
[SPEAKER_03]: it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say I approve of this
grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for a grinder,
this one would make you happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Chop Shop grinders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a joint rolled up so I'm going to
light this joint and we're going to smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: a joint together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you guys are rolling something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you guys twisted up a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me a tweet and let me know what
you're smoking with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send the tweet to at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, my brain went blank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even lit this joint yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me a tweet there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear it because I'm going
to light this joint and then we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get to the main topic of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main topic is going to be ... It's
kind of a double topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's male selection and starting a
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got multiple emails about male selection
and breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to choose two of those emails
and read them to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we will also talk about pollen
storage and we'll talk about another
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's light this joint and then we'll read
an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke a whole bunch of flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I do light a big joint, there's some
weed that I grew that was dried and cured
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly and trimmed by me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a real treat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and it burns nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a good job, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish somebody was here to pass this
joint too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to smoke this joint and
read an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: The email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I discovered your podcast a couple of
months ago and I've become an avid fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You present a perfect balance of friendly
personality and real information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many, in fact, I'd say most cannabis
podcasters do too much of one or the
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like many of your fans, my only problem is
wanting more episodes and for them to be
[SPEAKER_03]: longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on a longer episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you've noticed that the last
episode was a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Mike is here, the episodes get really
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to make them a little bit
longer for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This joint is just hitting like a champ,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to keep puffing on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole area is cloudy already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the email goes on to say,
I particularly enjoy hearing all about
[SPEAKER_03]: your breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you might be able to
talk on the show about how you would go
[SPEAKER_03]: about starting a small breeding project
from the ground up because it's something
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd really like to explore in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to know about your strategy for
choosing strains or for choosing traits
[SPEAKER_03]: and strains you want to cross and how you
keep a male you like such as Solomon going
[SPEAKER_03]: for multiple breeds and how long the
process from ideal idea to stable seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I run the mom department at a large
dispensary in Denver and because I have
[SPEAKER_03]: limited space to work with, I have started
using bonsai techniques such as root
[SPEAKER_03]: pruning to keep the mom small.
[SPEAKER_03]: With this technique, they live fairly
happy in a two gallon pot indefinitely
[SPEAKER_03]: staying around a foot or two tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, my oldest is about a year old and
her clones still root and produce healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you have any knowledge
or experience with this method that you
[SPEAKER_03]: would want to share with someone who is
trying it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, teach me that method please
because my mother plants grow so quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: that I have to put them into larger pots
and this sounds like something that would
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit me because I try to keep a large
amount of mother plants and I don't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please send me your tech on this,
share that with me and I will talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: it more on the show for other listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the email goes on to say, lastly,
I was hoping you could give this dad
[SPEAKER_03]: amateur a few tips on not coughing so hard
after dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for all the great podcasts that
keep me smiling and learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers, Jessica.
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually says, PS, you can use my
first name on the podcast if you want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: She also included her Instagram handle and
I am now following you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over a couple of those things
real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, thanks for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You started the email by complimenting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do need to learn more about your mother
plant tech, but then you said you were
[SPEAKER_03]: hoping that I could give you a few tips on
not coughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: After dabs, I am going to reveal some Jedi
secrets for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, if you're coughing a lot,
your nail may be too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let that nail cool, go for some low temp
dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably know that already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to teach you some Rasta Jeff
tricks here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take gigantic dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that a lot of my lung health and
how large my dabs can be, how my ability
[SPEAKER_03]: to take large dabs directly correlates
with my level of hydration.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't drink enough water and I get
dry, my lungs get sore and I cannot take
[SPEAKER_03]: the dabs that I desire to take.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to stay hydrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to drink plenty of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more water I drink, the bigger dabs I
can take.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I have to exercise my lungs and
allow my lungs time to rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your lungs, they need rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like a giant muscle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They expand and contract.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that they're really a muscle,
but they work that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get bigger, they get smaller,
they grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You breathe in, you breathe out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're putting a lot of work on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need some time to rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I get up, I need to breathe for a
little bit before I take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get the lungs going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get the heart rate moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get the blood moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do some breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it's time to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not do like a pre-dab breathe
exercise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to let the lungs wake up,
let my body get breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll take my first dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: If my first dab makes me want to choke,
I can control my body.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said this to a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said this to a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of us, if you get like a leg twitch
or a leg cramp or a leg itch, or if your
[SPEAKER_03]: foot itches or something, you don't just
fall on the ground and start twitching and
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't go out of control and you don't
just give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe your children do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen kids do it and it's fucking
hilarious, but we don't do that as adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would we let our lungs be out of
control?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you've got control of your,
unless you're sick or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to make fun of anybody,
but a normal human being, a normal adult
[SPEAKER_03]: person, myself, I would not accept my leg
just walking out from underneath me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not tolerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if my leg starts to get a cramp or
something, I use my mind and I control my
[SPEAKER_03]: legs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say, stand still motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do the same thing with my lungs,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm about to choke, my lungs are mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not have to let my lungs do this
rapid expansion and make me choke and turn
[SPEAKER_03]: purple and feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm about to cough, I breathe in as
hard as I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel that tickle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go, and your body goes, and your chest
does this instant move.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I feel that coming, I breathe in as
hard as I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I've just changed my lungs mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wanted to cough, but it's like,
oh, he's, I'm busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't cough cause he's got me inhaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as soon as I get that breath,
as far in me as I can, I push out,
[SPEAKER_03]: I parse my lips and I push my,
my smoke goes out at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I push out as hard as I can, but through
parsed lips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about this in the past episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep my lips kind of together to keep
that air coming out slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now there's pressure on my lung,
but I'm not blowing out all that smoke at
[SPEAKER_03]: one ridiculous time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's keeping my lung busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't, I'm so busy focusing on that
breath that my lungs will not twitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Jedi mind tricking myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am yoga breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Lamaze breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just tricking my body into not
being able to cough by keeping it busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy by the name of Wim Hoff who
teaches a lot of breathing techniques and
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of body healing technique just
through breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of yoga is based on breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of meditation is based on breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lamaze is all breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if these things can get you
through huge situations in life,
[SPEAKER_03]: women use Lamaze to get through
childbirth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I delivered a child.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_03]: My child was born at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: I delivered that kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the kind of breathing that mama had
to do to not lose her shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the only thing she had.
[SPEAKER_03]: She could scream at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: She could have faith in whatever she has
faith in and she could breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And breathing is the one thing I could
physically see get her through the pain
[SPEAKER_03]: and the challenge of having a child.
[SPEAKER_03]: So breathing is magical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Control your breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't let your legs run out from
underneath you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't let your hand punch you in the
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't let your lungs spaz out and
cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take a big breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you got to go in through your
nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you got to go in through the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about just tricking your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you get that huge powerful
breath going in and out, just repeat that
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll only take two or three breaths
to get your lungs to not even want to
[SPEAKER_03]: choke anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you get good at it, you'll be
able to control it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if what I'm doing to myself
is good for my body, but I'm sure that the
[SPEAKER_03]: violent coughing fits that you get when
you take too big of a dab are not good for
[SPEAKER_03]: your body either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am probably saving myself some
stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that your lungs only get so many
expansion and contractions and inhales and
[SPEAKER_03]: exhales and so many coughs before
something starts to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like any car part or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to blow out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm just trying to get as many
miles on my lungs as I can without blowing
[SPEAKER_03]: them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of what I learned,
the breathing technique came from a man by
[SPEAKER_03]: the breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would make you breathe in as deeply as
you could through your nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you've got your lungs are filled
with air, your chest is fully expanded.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel like you're full.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would tell you, breathe in a little
more, a little more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just, you just have to like force
in a little breath through your nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're just trying to suck in this
last bit of air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once he thinks you're full and
he's satisfied, he'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_03]: now blow all the way out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would make us blow out and he would
say, there's more in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd be trying to force your,
like you'd be squeezing weird muscles to
[SPEAKER_03]: force your lungs to push out that last bit
of air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and your body would make weird
noises.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're trying to push air out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he would immediately make you
breathe right in again, as hard as you can
[SPEAKER_03]: now go deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was how I would slow my heart
rate and my breathing and get control,
[SPEAKER_03]: get my composure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, when I was in a, a spar or a karate
tournament or a match in my heart rate,
[SPEAKER_03]: my mind were getting away or my breathing
was getting away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our way to recenter and it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only takes two or three of those five
of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were on top of your game all over
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, the trick to not coughing is
control your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a Jedi about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your lungs busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your lungs can't freak out and start
coughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're controlling them and your mind
and your lungs are stuck together,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're just focused on that breathing that
in and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only things you got to do breathe in,
breathe out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do want to answer more of your
breathing question, but I've got another
[SPEAKER_03]: email that I want to read and I will
answer both of the questions kind of at
[SPEAKER_03]: once.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm finding the other email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's here in my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise this email has a lot of stuff
going on, so it'll take me a second to get
[SPEAKER_03]: through it, but it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, just in case you're
wondering, I'm a little more than halfway
[SPEAKER_03]: through this joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been puffing it when you don't hear
me talking and I'm getting well medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ross and Jeff, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been listening to your podcast for a
while now and I have a few questions on
[SPEAKER_03]: breathing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out here in Colorado just doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a new tree of life, high CBD strain
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had 100% germination and 50% male to
female ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty solid, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering when selecting a male to
use for pollination as the father,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you look for?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about that in just a
second, but I want to get through your
[SPEAKER_03]: email.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also say, do you do any testing on the
leaves to find CBD or THC content?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also mentions that he's obviously
looking for the lowest THC possible as to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep them under the 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want your plants to qualify as
hemp in Colorado, they have to test at
[SPEAKER_03]: less than 0.3% THC or they are considered
cannabis and you can't sell that flower as
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp flower and it has to be grown in a
completely different environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: With completely different licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it tests too high, if you grow your
hemp at a hemp farm and it tests too high
[SPEAKER_03]: in THC, it must be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's trying to breed and he's trying to
keep it low THC, high CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: The email goes on to say, is there any
truth in having males growing next to
[SPEAKER_03]: females could make the females hermy?
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that recently somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's asking if having males grow next
to the females will make the females herm?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that will not make the females herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have males near your female plants,
I feel like the females know the males are
[SPEAKER_03]: there and they get stickier and the
trichomes get a little thicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I think the female plants
can smell the males or they can feel a
[SPEAKER_03]: pheromone or a hormone in the air and they
get a little hornier and they show more
[SPEAKER_03]: signs of wanting pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, having a male plant near your
female plants will not make the females
[SPEAKER_03]: herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what will happen is the males will
pollinate the females and it will not take
[SPEAKER_03]: much pollen and it will not take a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the females will herm, they will seed
because they were properly pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you say, when breeding, when is the
best time to hit the ladies with pollen?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about that here and more
of my breeding rant when I combine the two
[SPEAKER_03]: emails with one answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I just realized that I skipped
right over your part about asking about
[SPEAKER_03]: testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not do any testing on the leaves to
find CBD or THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that is a very useful option that
is available from our friends at Steep
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to do that, I highly
encourage you to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will give you an idea, but it will
not give you the exact potency,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it'll give you an idea of what the
ratios will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have the leaves tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, I would recommend Steep Hill
Labs for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can also do early testing to tell you
if your plants from seed are males or
[SPEAKER_03]: females.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_03]: It also says, will they need six to seven
weeks to fully mature?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about that in a little
more detail in just a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also go on to say, I have a lot of
testing to be done on my 10 female phenos,
[SPEAKER_03]: five cherry wine F3 and five cobblers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing to begin at day 43 of flower to
day 56 per pheno to find that highest CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: content and lowest THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck with your pheno hunting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pheno hunting is always fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love doing a nice pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you find the phenotype that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you find that perfect CBD for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're able to make great medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this project goes well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go on to say, thank you for your time
and keep the podcast going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only came across yours recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Been listening to a bunch of your old
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there access to some of your older ones
that are not in the feed?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how many episodes Stitcher is
holding, but iTunes has the most recent
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're able to listen via iTunes,
you can get a hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening through my website,
iregeneticscolorado.com, you can go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: iregeneticscolorado.com website.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a grow from your heart podcast
tab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will take you to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the best of my knowledge, there should
be 100 episodes available there,
[SPEAKER_03]: which will get you all the way back to
we're at 174.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll get all the way back to about
75, which that's a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if you do want the old stuff,
I plan on putting the older episodes back
[SPEAKER_03]: into the feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just redropping them is kind of like new
episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll add a new intro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk to you a minute and let you know
it's a repeat and we'll put the old
[SPEAKER_03]: episodes back.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're impatient and you don't want to
wait for that, send me an email and I will
[SPEAKER_03]: consider sending you the files for older
episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how many I can do at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I get several people that want them
together, I'll try to send them in chunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there are a few of you that want
those old episodes sent in chunks,
[SPEAKER_03]: send me an email and I'll try to get them
out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this will get something going,
but I do intend on putting them back into
[SPEAKER_03]: the feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like starting around episode 200,
was kind of my idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get 200 episodes out and then maybe
once every two weeks or once a week on a
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday, we'll just plop in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm going to start with one
because one was terrible, but we'll do
[SPEAKER_03]: like episode, old episodes in not perfect
order, but we'll do them in chronological
[SPEAKER_03]: order, but we may skip a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there will be a way to hear old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're really dying to hear those
first few, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes on to say, all I do is garden and
listen to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was funny to hear the ones you
listen to were all the same ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listened to all the comic podcasts for
sure, except bill burr is at the top of my
[SPEAKER_03]: list and you had him down at the bottom of
yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill burr is a bit much for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets, uh, I know it's funny that I'm
sitting here doing a podcast by myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: but to listen to bill burr rant by himself
on a podcast sometimes isn't my favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he talks about shit that I don't,
I'm not a sport.
[SPEAKER_03]: He talks a lot about goddamn sports and I
don't care about football at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I don't listen to bill burr
as much as some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of religiously listened to Rogan,
Doug Benson, Joey Coco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are a lot of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I've been listening to a podcast
that I think you guys would enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give a shout out to my friend,
Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's been getting a shout out in the past
few podcasts, but, uh, she's been
[SPEAKER_03]: reciprocating on her show.
[SPEAKER_03]: She does a great podcast about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her show is called the spliff podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that I say the word spliff
poorly because my voice, my mouth,
[SPEAKER_03]: my accent, the word spliff fucking sucks
for my mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I've got cotton mouth from smoking
this whole joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm probably saying it even worse,
but the name of her podcast is spliff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The spliff S P L I F F the spliff podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you check out Bo Nellis at
the spliff podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you say hit me back when you get a
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you sign the email with the name
buck, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this worked out as hitting you
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send you an email to let you know,
to listen to this episode, but dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's your official hit back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, uh, Jess and buck, I appreciate
both of you for the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate both of you being interested
in breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to press pause and take a
drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I get back, I am going to rent a
long time about starting a breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: project and selecting a good male.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast rolled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am nicely hydrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am nicely medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I smoked that whole joint while we
were talking, but, uh, something made me
[SPEAKER_03]: want to take some dabs while I was taking
a break.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took a couple of dabs and on my head
is a little spinning and I feel super
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get back to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys that asked for longer episodes
are truly going to get what you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: asking for in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've been going for 30 minutes now,
and we're just about to get to the main
[SPEAKER_03]: topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main topic of course is breeding,
setting up a breeding area and also
[SPEAKER_03]: selecting your males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk a little bit about
selecting your females for your breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing I should talk about when
you're going to start a breeding project
[SPEAKER_03]: is books or the books come into play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Books are the first thing before you do
anything with cannabis, before you start
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, before you start breeding,
before you start doing anything with weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you should read about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read about growing, be prepared,
know what's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you listen to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about weed, but I can't tell you
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you bought a basic grow book and read
it from beginning to end and then started
[SPEAKER_03]: growing weed, you would be prepared for
all the shit that's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you wouldn't be in scramble mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: So books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some books, read about breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just read the basics of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two books that I can really recommend are
the cannabis breeders Bible by Greg Green.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is available online in a PDF for
free.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have no excuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go online, type in cannabis breeders
Bible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll pop up as a PDF in Google.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go read that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I truly recommend a book that I'm
pulling up on my phone here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is called, it's just simply marijuana
botany by Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly recommend both of those books.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to do any breeding,
if you want to read further about cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, I also recommend anything for
more Horace or Vantes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like, let's grow a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like all of the Ed Rosenthal grow
books.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ed Rosenthal Oakster Dam course guide
is a great grow book in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But start with the cannabis breeders
Bible, then move on to marijuana botany
[SPEAKER_03]: and you will have a great basic
understanding of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you have an understanding of
cannabis and a kind of an idea,
[SPEAKER_03]: an idea for breeding, you need to build a
grow room or use your existing grow room
[SPEAKER_03]: for a breeding area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a breeding room is just like any other
grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a grow light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need it sealed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a sealed room so that when it is
dark, a light seal is what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it is dark, you cannot have any light
coming into that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whenever you choose to have your dark
period for 12 hours at a time,
[SPEAKER_03]: there can be no light interruptions,
no light leaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need a room with a light on a
timer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a controllable dark time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be able to get water to that
room and you need to be able to get old
[SPEAKER_03]: air out and fresh air into that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you already have a grow room,
it probably can be used just like it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing you need to consider is
pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That room is going to get filled with
pollen and wherever you were ducting your
[SPEAKER_03]: exhaust, pollen is going to go out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have an outdoor garden and
you're ducting your grow room outside,
[SPEAKER_03]: you may be blowing pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right into your outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have another grow room that's in
flower, you need to control where that
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good way to keep tabs on pollen is
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water deactivates pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to find a way to either spray
yourself, your plants, both for pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: control.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get pollen in one room,
you're going to the other flower room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to hose yourself down and you
need to spray down the female plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't want pollinated and that'll keep
the pollen away from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you need a grow room with at
least a 600 watt light or larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think, people will say that you can
grow with the 400 or a 250 or an LED or a
[SPEAKER_03]: T5, but I think a 600 watt light is the
smallest I would use for breeding because
[SPEAKER_03]: I want strong, healthy plants with strong,
healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for an affordable way to
set up a breeding area and you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of space or a lot of funding,
you can use a five by five or a three by
[SPEAKER_03]: three grow hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to use the five by five grow hut
with a 600 watt or a thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 600 watt light is plenty of light for
a five by five hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the summer, I'll put a 600 in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the winter, I'll put a thousand in
there because of course you can,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can cool it much more easily in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rooms are cold anyway, cause it's
freezing outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just use that thousand watt light
to keep everything warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take advantage of your surroundings guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I think I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get a five by five hut, put a 600 watt
light in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to put a ducted hood in my huts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got a five by five hut with a
ducted, I think it's like the extra sun
[SPEAKER_03]: six or the day star six, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a basic hood in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got six inch ducting coming off
of both sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a hole for the ducting on
each side of the hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that ducting goes out of each side of
the hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on one end, I've got a blower with the
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the air comes through the carbon
filter, through the blower, through the
[SPEAKER_03]: ducting, into the hut, over the light,
out of the light, out of the hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it just blows that air into the
room, basically blows it into another room
[SPEAKER_03]: for me is where I have it running.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what that does is it keeps the light,
the heat from the light never gets to go
[SPEAKER_03]: into my grow hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of keeps my hut a little bit
cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there's a six inch hole on the roof
of those grow huts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a six inch hydro farm, a blower and
just set it on top of the hut,
[SPEAKER_03]: extracting air.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sucks air out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you zip up the hut, it kind of
caves in a little bit because of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure, but that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's sucking air in through the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sucking in fresh air constantly and
shooting out hot, stale air from the top
[SPEAKER_03]: all the time and heat rises.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm pulling in cool air from the bottom
of the room that the hut is in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just shooting that air to the
top.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm always having circulation in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a light run in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The light is being cooled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got two blowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a reflector with a light in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a little bit of ducting and a
five by five hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically all you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can set up a breeding room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could have a separate space for
your male plant to start flowering and so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can keep your males and females
apart until the ideal time for
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not absolutely necessary if
you're breeding for personal seed
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you keep the plants apart for a little
longer, you're able to make a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: seed is mainly the reason for doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something else I want to mention,
I talked about pollen control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pollen control is hugely important for
flowering plants, plants that are
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering from about from the time they
show the hairs, you guys call them,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably those are pistols.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are calyx pistols from the times
those are shown from the time those
[SPEAKER_03]: appear.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant is able to receive pollen and
produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if your plants have pistols,
you need to keep pollen away from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Veg plants cannot be pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not worry about veg plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have veg plants, they'll be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you put them near flowering plants,
rinse them off with water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any pollen that got on them will be
deactivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you've been in your garden and
your garden has pollen in it and you've
[SPEAKER_03]: been messing with pollen or if you've been
pollinating your plants, don't go to your
[SPEAKER_03]: friend's house that grow because you don't
want to fuck up their garden and see their
[SPEAKER_03]: whole garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Change clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a shower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be proactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fuck up someone else's garden with
your pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do have a male plant outside,
pay attention to who else is growing
[SPEAKER_03]: around you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you may be fucking up someone else's
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be be aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to pay attention to what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about getting your room
built.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about pollen control and how
important pollen control is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were breeding, basic nutrients
can be used for your males and females,
[SPEAKER_03]: just your basic flowering newts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't use real heavy bloom boosters
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your nitrogen, your phosphorus,
your potassium in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep some carbohydrates come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe add a little bit of amino acids for
healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, your basic feed is going to
be just fine for your seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got a little breeding room built
and we know what to feed our plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I feel like it's time to talk about
selecting your plants for a breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big part about breeding is having a goal
in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have kind of an idea of what
you're trying to create with your breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you trying to make seeds for yourself
so that you can keep growing in the future
[SPEAKER_03]: with fresh seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you trying to breed new strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you trying to take a strain that is OK
and improve it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you trying to back cross something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about what you're trying to create
or you're trying to improve.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a breeder, it's your job to improve the
cannabis plant and not go backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the seeds that come out of your
breeding project are not better than the
[SPEAKER_03]: buds that they came from, you can throw
the entire project away and start another
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are trying to make something better.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about selecting
females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something you will get from the books that
I did not talk about earlier are charts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may want to learn about allele charts
and Mendel charts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of different charts to
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are very helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to target specific
traits, use charts.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to create new crosses to
see what you can do with your favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, go ahead and throw some pollen
and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But make sure you test those seeds very
well before you give them out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else I want to talk about is
using stable females.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people will get a clone and
they'll say, hey, I've got this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to breed to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll get a male and they put some
pollen on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always grow out a new clone at least two
or three times before you breed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to put my females through a
rigorous stress test before I breed with
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will put my female plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let them flower for seven to ten days
and then I will completely fuck up the
[SPEAKER_03]: timer in the grow room on purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my goal is to try to make these plants
hermaphrodite by stressing them with light
[SPEAKER_03]: stress by disrupting their photo period.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn the light on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go from 1212 and then I will turn it
off for 24 hours and then I will turn it
[SPEAKER_03]: on for 24 hours and then I'll put it back
on 1212 and I'll pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plants will herm with that much
disruption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them take a little more,
so I'll fuck with them again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn the light on for 24 hours again
and then turn it off for 12 hours,
[SPEAKER_03]: then turn it on for six or eight hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll go right back to the normal
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll do this throughout the bloom
phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by day 35, if something has hasn't
hermed, I will consider it probably strong
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to go into a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I'll finish it out,
but I want to kind of fuck with these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and see if they're hermaphrodite or
not on me from messing with them and
[SPEAKER_03]: causing them stress because the people
that buy seeds are going to mess up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want the progeny that comes from my
breeding projects to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: foolproof because I want to give people a
head start and not make them struggle from
[SPEAKER_03]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So use females that are tested,
that are trusted, that you've grown
[SPEAKER_03]: several times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to use females that have desirable
traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I love that I think I can make a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding is kind of like cheffing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're about to put ingredients from the
male plant with ingredients from the
[SPEAKER_03]: female plant together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to stir them up and then
you're going to grow that and you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to have a cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that cake is your finished buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind when you're making a
cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a female that's got a good node
structure that the inner node spacing is
[SPEAKER_03]: not too far apart on the main stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a female that flowers in a good
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like 70 day plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, a lot of people like plants that
are done in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like a 70 day flowering plant has a
lot of time to get the good quality sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: style THC buzz that I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: The indica plants don't give me that head
buzz that I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little longer plant, something that
smells real good and something that just
[SPEAKER_03]: grows real well and is desirable to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a female plant that you want to
breed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants with a lot of resin usually produce
offspring with a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more resinous your female plants,
the more likely you are to produce resiny
[SPEAKER_03]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically your favorite females are
great for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows by now what a good female
plant looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be easy to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have a goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find a female plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use more than one female in a
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing stopping you from putting,
I do several females in a room at one
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow them kind of big and then I'll put,
you know, I do probably six, I like to do
[SPEAKER_03]: six, seven gallon pots per thousand watt
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I fed them up to about just between
knee and waist high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to say that's probably about,
you know, 20, 24 to 28 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fed them about that tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I like to flower them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when it's time, I like to give
them pollen and I get plenty of seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: each plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes each of those six plants under
one light will be a different strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm creating something new,
I will do six different plants in there
[SPEAKER_03]: just to see what I can create.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll run all of those six new crosses
myself to see what I've created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's something that I love,
I will fill a light with just one strain
[SPEAKER_03]: and repeat the process and make a bunch
more seeds so that we can put them to the
[SPEAKER_03]: market or we can just do whatever needs to
be done with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first time I cross it, I just do a
whole bunch of plants in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I find the best of that new
cross, the best cross of that new project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I repeat those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a process of elimination.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, the things that you see come to
market from me is a very small portion of
[SPEAKER_03]: what I create.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't continue a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those six that I put under one light,
I'll put six different girls under there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll use one male and pollinate those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe two or three of those will get
repeated and the rest will get abandoned
[SPEAKER_03]: and I won't make more of that cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can put multiple females in the
room for breeding and you can make
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple different crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're making seeds for yourself,
that's a really fun way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can find a whole bunch of
great new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to do a little bit of
talking about male selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did an entire podcast about selecting
males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode number 121 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast is all about male selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a really in-depth podcast
about choosing a male for breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: check out episode number 121.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will give you a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't want to go back and
listen to that one, here is the short
[SPEAKER_03]: course for this episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choosing a male is very important because
I think the male will provide a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: aroma, a lot of the structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the general health of the
plant, the pest resistance, the mold
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance, a lot of that is going to come
from your male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something I look for in a male plant is
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the plant is shaped is going to
predict a lot of what your progeny are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be shaped like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want a sativa dominant plant
that gets kind of tall, that grows really
[SPEAKER_03]: tall colas, you want a male that gets tall
and has really tall colas.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a short stout indica dominant
plant, you want a male that grows short
[SPEAKER_03]: and stout and squat and is shaped the way
you want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think about what you want out of your
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where having a goal comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_03]: So structure is important to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like close, close, tight node
structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when that stem starts growing,
I want a set of branches to come out and
[SPEAKER_03]: then I want about, you know, an inch and
then another set of branches coming out
[SPEAKER_03]: and then like an inch and then more
branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, close, tight inter nodal spacing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I really like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing I really pay attention to is
the aroma of my male plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to rub the stem with my fingers and
then smell my fingers and see what it
[SPEAKER_03]: smells like.
[SPEAKER_03]: A plant that has a fruity smell is going
to make fruity progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I am breeding, I kind of lean towards
the more fuely, more funky sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: smelling things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a male plant that smells like puke
or vomit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a great male for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it passes on great traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I really like to see in a
male plant, and it's kind of odd,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't happen all the time,
but trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love to see trichomes on a male
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to let them be male.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to get about four or five,
maybe even six weeks into flower to show
[SPEAKER_03]: me the trichomes and start dropping
pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see trichomes on a male
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is most likely going to be the plant
that I choose for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the fifth one, but probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll explain why.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants that flower too early,
right away, are going to be too dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: in the breeding crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to turn yellow toward the
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way to find that out,
you guys, is to flower your male plants to
[SPEAKER_03]: come across in the offsprings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have taken male plants to ten weeks just
to see what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what Solomon does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ten weeks in, my male plant is an Arise
male.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an F1.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it Arise.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male that I have chosen from that is
known as King Solomon because he is the
[SPEAKER_03]: king.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what he looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He keeps dumping pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant could probably go 10 or 11
weeks, no problem, and stay nice and
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy with the way I feed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would look wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what my plants do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay attention to the color.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is going to pass on to your progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it turns orange, if it turns purple,
if it turns yellow, that is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to the offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, speed of development is something
that I pay a lot of attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want the male plants that start
flowering early.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I get a 10 pack of seeds,
hypothetically five of those seeds will be
[SPEAKER_03]: males.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want the first two to show me
that they are males and start dropping
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like the third or fourth one is
most likely going to be the plant that I
[SPEAKER_03]: choose for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the fifth one, but probably not,
and I'll explain why.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants that flower too early and right
away are going to be too dominant in the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are going to pass on way too much of
their traits, and they are not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: allow enough of the female traits to come
across in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I eliminate the early flowering males.
[SPEAKER_03]: The males that start dumping pollen the
soonest, they usually get cold from my
[SPEAKER_03]: garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm paying attention to how long it takes
these plants to show me that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: males, how long it takes for the male
pollen sacks to start dropping,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also how long it takes for the pollen
sacks to open and start dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are things I'm really paying
attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like to pay attention to how much
pollen comes out and how long my plants
[SPEAKER_03]: will keep dumping pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are things that really matter to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of pollen is important
because I make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a plant that will keep going so
that I can keep tapping it every couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: days and get some more pollen out of it if
I need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a nice robust male.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times I'll try to find a male
that looks very similar to a female that I
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I got a 10 pack of seeds and there was
a female in there that I really liked that
[SPEAKER_03]: was the perfect female out of the 10 pack,
I hope for a male that has the same shape
[SPEAKER_03]: and the same characteristics as that
female because I know that's going to pass
[SPEAKER_03]: on those traits that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that I do not like out of a
breeding plant is something that gets
[SPEAKER_03]: really tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that starts stretching and has a
lot of internode space, it's going to make
[SPEAKER_03]: too much fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be more hemp than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get a big stretchy plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I don't like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to stay away from.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a male that is just shooting
above the canopy of all the other plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: just pull that one out because it's going
to create problematic progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly you want a male with a good
structure that smells good, that produces
[SPEAKER_03]: trichomes, that grows the way you want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually if you get a 10 pack and you get
five males, you're going to want that
[SPEAKER_03]: third or fourth male is going to be your
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my intuition.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's usually what I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the traits to that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for one that looks like a female that
you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you should have yourself a nice
quality male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that it dumps plenty of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that it produces nice big fat
flower clusters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want big tight fat male flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want big fluffy sparse male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it to look like a big cola of
male flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more male flowers the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means you're going to pass on that
trait and you're going to produce big fat
[SPEAKER_03]: female buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fat male clusters are going to be a super
desirable trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing you should not breed with
you guys, any plant that has ever shown
[SPEAKER_03]: any sign of hermaphrodism, do not breed
with any hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it shows bananas, ever do not breed
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so now we know how to select
females.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know how to select males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is something else I want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were breeding to narrow down
specific traits, if you want your progeny
[SPEAKER_03]: to look like a certain thing, then it is a
good idea to select one male.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a female and you've got a
male and you're trying to get this part of
[SPEAKER_03]: this male and this part of this female
into your cross, it is wise to use one
[SPEAKER_03]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if you want to open up the
breeding and see what you can create,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's always fun to use multiple males of
the same cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say a rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to breed with a rise,
if you want to make a rise to ... What did
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a rise to?
[SPEAKER_03]: A rise to lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it Firefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take a rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a rise to lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used one a rise male to one lemon skunk
female because I knew what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to put this robust growth from a
rise, this cola size from a rise and this
[SPEAKER_03]: node structure and this thick branching
into this really flavorful yet kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: wispy lemon skunk cross that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that I wanted King Solomon by
himself to pollinate that lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: because my goal was the cross of those
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if I wanted to see what I could
create without narrowing it down and since
[SPEAKER_03]: I plan on selling these seeds and putting
it to market, I wanted it to be a very
[SPEAKER_03]: close representation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to be able to predict what I was
making is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wanted to open up the breeding and
kind of create some chaos, I would put
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple a rise males in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would grow out a bunch of a rise seeds
and I would find four males and then I
[SPEAKER_03]: would put those four males in with
whatever female plants I chose to and I
[SPEAKER_03]: would use the pollen from all four of
those a rise males and that's called an
[SPEAKER_03]: open pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that's going to do, it is going to
show a lot of different phenotypes because
[SPEAKER_03]: now I've got four different fathers in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a lot of recessive traits
from that male line that I would not have
[SPEAKER_03]: brought out by using one male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to narrow down traits,
if you're trying to narrow down your
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding and get specific traits out,
use one male.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to open up the breeding
and find new cool shit, use multiple males
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is called open pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the multiple male method or for the
single male method, you can use one female
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can use multiple females however
you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is when you do harvest,
keep all of those seeds very well labeled
[SPEAKER_03]: and be honest with everybody about the
work that you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that are growing the seeds that you
create deserve to know exactly what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pollen sacks are going to open up and
pollen is going to start coming out of
[SPEAKER_03]: those male plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen it start any later than
day 21.
[SPEAKER_03]: It rarely takes that long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Female plants are able to receive pollen
as soon as they have pistols.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as you see those little white
hairs sticking up out of your female
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, they are able to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the ideal time for them to
receive pollen is not until around day 25
[SPEAKER_03]: to 32.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they received pollen too early,
you're not going to get a lot of seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pollinate too early, your plants
are really little.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of space for a seed to
develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are not a lot of bud sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't have as many seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wait too long, your calyx pistols
miss their prime.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are no longer ready to breed
and you will not make as many seeds as you
[SPEAKER_03]: wish you would have.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hit the pollen onto the females
between days 25 and 32, you will get the
[SPEAKER_03]: most out of your pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is a big part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: The timing of breeding is a huge
challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your male plants are going to start
dropping their pollen around day 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your female plants are not ready for
pollen until around day 25 to 32.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trick is you need to keep that male
plant away from your female plants for
[SPEAKER_03]: about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you start them at the same time,
you got to keep them apart for about 10
[SPEAKER_03]: days or you're not going to get as many
seeds as you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either keep your male in another
area to where the pollen can't get to the
[SPEAKER_03]: females.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can start your females a little bit
early.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can start flowering your females 10
days before your males.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way they're 10 days ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way when the male starts dropping
pollen, they'll be timed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get the females 10 days ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be 25 days into flower when your
male is 15 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll give you a weak window to get the
pollen onto the plants and hopefully you
[SPEAKER_03]: can time it up perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you ran your male plant at least
one time before you bred with him and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know how long it's going to take for him
to start dropping pollen and it makes this
[SPEAKER_03]: math equation a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need him to be dropping pollen when
your plants are 25 to 32 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing you can do is you can
collect the pollen in a jar and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: apply it to the plants at the perfect
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: One good thing about having the pollen in
a jar is that if you are running a normal
[SPEAKER_03]: crop that you don't want to seed
everything, you can pull one plant aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take it to another area and you
can just use a Q-tip and dip that Q-tip
[SPEAKER_03]: into the pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can apply it to a couple of bud sites
that you want to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark that branch so that you know it got
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let that plant sit for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let that pollen soak in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it do what it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then get a sprayer and spray that plant
off with water and it will deactivate all
[SPEAKER_03]: of the loose pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then go to your grow room and hopefully
you cleaned your clothes too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to your grow room and spray all of
those plants with water before you return
[SPEAKER_03]: that plant to the grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be able to make just a few
seeds for yourself if you're very careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must be very careful and you'll get
better at this as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got that jar of pollen sitting
there, the options are endless.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pollinate one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pollinate the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always got a jar of pollen on hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about pollination, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of really easy ways to
pollinate your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is dropping pollen and you've got
female plants that are ready for pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either take the male plant right
into the grow where the females are and
[SPEAKER_03]: give it a nice shake and just watch that
cloud of dust come out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that pollen is now airborne.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to land on your females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every piece of pollen that touches a
pistol will now be absorbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll become a seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have just pollinated your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can set that male plant in front of a
fan and just turn the fan on and watch it
[SPEAKER_03]: blow pollen all over your females.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cut the plant down and carry it
into the room and you can actually smack
[SPEAKER_03]: it up against the female plants if you
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have done and seen this done and it
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my male plant way too big the last
time I did a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no moving it because if I would
have moved it, pollen would have gone
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not want to waste that much pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a small area of females.
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked over to the male plant and I cut
a branch off of the male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I cut it, a little bit of pollen came
out because of the scissor click.
[SPEAKER_03]: I held the branch, I gave it a cut,
and I walked that branch over to the
[SPEAKER_03]: females.
[SPEAKER_03]: I held it just a couple of inches above
the female plants and I gave it a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: shake.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just see the cloud of pollen
come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave it another shake and then I flicked
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a flick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of pollen came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably took one medium-sized branch
to pollinate an entire light worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I used two or three branches
because I wanted to make sure to get
[SPEAKER_03]: enough pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either move the male plant to the
room and leave it alive and give it a
[SPEAKER_03]: shake and let it pollinate naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put a fan in front of it and blow
it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually seen guys hit the fan with
the male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way it hits it and it just fucking
explodes pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cut a branch off and carry the
branch to the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, another thing that you can do if
you've got a jar of stored pollen,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm going to teach you how to store
pollen next.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a jar of stored pollen,
all you've got to do is take that stored
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen and I just stick my gloved hand
into the jar of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a rubber glove on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put the hand right in there and now
my glove has pollen stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just go and sprinkle above the plants
and just touch the plants and they will
[SPEAKER_03]: get pollinated by that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could put some in your hand and blow
it if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you need to do is get that fancy dust,
that fairy dust, that pixie dust all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the pistols of your girl plants and they
are now pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the plants are pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when that pollen touches,
it will take very few minutes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the white hairs that you guys talk
about, the pistols, everyone calls them
[SPEAKER_03]: hairs, the pistols will start to curl up
and turn brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you know they've been used.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are now pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll start to shrivel up and get weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the leaves will do funky things
when the plants get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all plant specific, but you'll
definitely see the pistols get brown and
[SPEAKER_03]: curved and withered and they'll look like
they expired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those seeds are going to take about 40 to
50 days to get ready from pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pollinate on day 25, around day 65
to 75, your seeds will be ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow it just like normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep feeding it like you normally do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give it as much boosters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still flush because there's going to be
material that will be turned into hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about harvesting your seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should talk about collecting and storing
pollen before we get to harvesting your
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pollen collection is very easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got that male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either set a plate, just a white
dinner plate underneath your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you don't have any fans blowing
or blowers blowing it around, the pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: will fall directly out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gravity will take it right down and it
will gather on that plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use a mirror.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used an old drum head one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a 22 inch kick drum head underneath
my male plant and all the pollen that fell
[SPEAKER_03]: landed inside the kick drum head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you've got all that pollen gathered,
do not let it get wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: If water touches that pollen, it's fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's useless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the pollen falls onto the plate or
the drum head or whatever it lands onto,
[SPEAKER_03]: I used my ID or a credit card and I just
scoop it up into a nice little pile and
[SPEAKER_03]: then I let it dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need the pollen to get completely dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are little male flowers that fall
in there, when you're collecting the
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen, pick those out because they have
moisture and they'll fuck up your pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will make that pollen inactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll get funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll get chunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't be any good.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're patient and you've got the room
and the time, just put something
[SPEAKER_03]: underneath your male plant and let it drop
pollen and then you can collect it that
[SPEAKER_03]: way naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have the space and you're not
that patient or maybe you want to get more
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen more quickly, an easy thing to do
is I like to cut the branch off the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I hold it over the plate and I
just tap it with my finger right directly
[SPEAKER_03]: onto the plate and then you get a lot of
pollen just falls.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use a mirror.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use a Tupperware dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something glass is ideal because it
doesn't stick as well and it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_03]: static.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a mirror or a big dinner
plate or a sushi plate is ideal,
[SPEAKER_03]: cut the branch off, hold it over the sushi
plate in a room with no wind and away from
[SPEAKER_03]: all your female plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use tap tech is what I call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tap that pollen right out of the
branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tap it right onto the plate,
right onto the mirror and just let it dry
[SPEAKER_03]: and then scoop it up and put it into a
glass jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a good idea to put a silicate
package in there, not a Boveda pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not want to keep it humid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a silicate pack that will dry it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it as dry as it can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull all the male flowers out,
get it in a jar and let it get completely
[SPEAKER_03]: dry and then if you want to store that
pollen, just put it in a cool,
[SPEAKER_03]: dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people like to put it in the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a filing cabinet that is in a
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stays in the back of the filing
cabinet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dry and it's dark and that pollen
stays good for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have used that pollen six months after
I've stored it and it has been completely
[SPEAKER_03]: viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another good way to catch pollen is a
pollen collection bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends at Hort Solutions on Instagram
sent me these bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what this material is made
out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a thick paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is almost like a filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like a filter for maybe a thick
coffee filter, but they made a bag out of
[SPEAKER_03]: it and it's got a little clear plastic
window in it so you can see inside,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what this bag is for, you slide it
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: This would probably fit if you grew a
small male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could almost fit the entire male plant
in there if you trimmed off the lower
[SPEAKER_03]: branches and just used that one main cola.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could fit an entire plant or a large
branch in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would probably be the top cola of one
of my plants would fit right inside there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you seal it at the bottom with either
some tape or a rubber band.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it starts to pollinate, the pollen
cannot get out of the bag, but the air can
[SPEAKER_03]: flow through the bag so that the plants
will live.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't die because they're still
getting light and air, but when the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: starts to drop its pollen, you can watch
the pollen come out and the pollen doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stays right inside the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you feel like you've got enough
pollen or like that plant is expired and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to quit making pollen,
you can cut the branch and then open the
[SPEAKER_03]: bag up and take the bud out or the branch
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a good shake before you take it
out and then all of your pollen will be
[SPEAKER_03]: contained inside that bag and you can pour
that into a jar or whatever type of
[SPEAKER_03]: container you're going to keep it in and
then pull out the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your silicate pack in there and now
you have got pollen that you gathered on
[SPEAKER_03]: your own in a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, this bag works in reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to pollinate one branch of a
plant, so you have that jar of pollen,
[SPEAKER_03]: you take your plant like I talked about
earlier, take it to a safe place with no
[SPEAKER_03]: wind, use a Q-tip or a paintbrush,
dip it into your jar of pollen,
[SPEAKER_03]: paint that onto a bud, then you put this
bag over it and then that will prevent
[SPEAKER_03]: that pollen from getting into the rest of
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it works as a catch or as sort of a
pollen condom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great device.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are interested in one,
they do not pay me to say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am checking to make sure I give you the
right web address.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is www.pollin.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's www.hort-solutions.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hort-solutions.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to follow them on Instagram,
it's hort underscore solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great product, great way to catch
pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that is how you collect your
pollen, storing pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you how to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just keep it in a cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's talk about harvesting your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I've been going for an hour and
six minutes and honestly, my voice is
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to get tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to start going a little more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harvesting seeds is very easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like any other harvest, about 14 days
before you begin harvesting, start
[SPEAKER_03]: flushing your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is feed your plants
clean pH balanced water for the last 10 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 days of your flowering cycle and your
plants, your buds will taste much better
[SPEAKER_03]: when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know we're growing seeds right now,
but there is going to be material left
[SPEAKER_03]: over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may want to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may want to turn it into extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may want to make edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please do flush it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why people don't flush it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 14 days that you don't have to use
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water is going into the plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get why people don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 14 days before harvest, start flushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two or three days before you chop down the
plants, go in the grow room and pull off
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the large leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any big leaf with a petiole, any leaf
that's in the way, go ahead and take it
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are going to get harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not need those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at harvest time, here is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what works for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to chop down the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to hang that plant upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a label on it so I know exactly what
plant that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I write the date on it so I know what day
I chopped it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to let the plants hang upside down
until they are crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, we're pulling seeds out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to dry and cure this bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it get crispy dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes if you let it get too dry,
seeds will start falling out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I like to do is put something
underneath each plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I leave them far enough apart to where if
I have got strain A and strain B and seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: fall out, I know that those seeds are not
going to mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put a drum head or a box or some sort
of catch container underneath the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: to catch any stray seeds that fall out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I don't even care about the
stray seeds that fall out because I have
[SPEAKER_03]: so many that I don't even worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sweep them up and they go in the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they get given away as mystery
seeds to friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hang the plants upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them get crispy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the plants get nice and dry and
crispy, I cut them into sections that are
[SPEAKER_03]: more manageable and I put them in a long
Tupperware container and I just let them
[SPEAKER_03]: dry even further.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I've got a whole bunch of strain A,
I will put all of strain A into one
[SPEAKER_03]: container if it fits and then I put on
some rubber gloves and honestly,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just start mushing up the buds with my
fingers and it just starts crumbling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just starts falling apart and you can
just hear the seeds come raining out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds just come falling out of the
buds if you did it correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cut down the plants, let them dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until they're crispy, cut them into
manageable sections, put them in a
[SPEAKER_03]: container, either a pie plate,
a Tupperware container, some sort of thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that when the seeds fall out, it's not
gonna roll away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start crushing it up, wear some gloves,
crush it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna hear the seeds come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're gonna have little stems,
you're gonna have dried bud material and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna have seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can throw all the stems away,
put all the seeds in a jar and then you've
[SPEAKER_03]: got a bunch of bud material that you can
either make edibles out of, you can give
[SPEAKER_03]: it to a friend, you can extract it,
you can smoke it, you can use it as a
plant fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally like to make hash with my
material that comes from my seeded plants
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think something happens to the
plant when it gets seeded and the oil that
[SPEAKER_03]: comes from it, I like to make BHO,
the hash oil that comes from it,
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to get me a little bit better of a
high, a different high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like it does something that
normal hash doesn't do when it's made from
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that were not seeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how you harvest your seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically cut down the plants,
let them dry, put it over a container and
[SPEAKER_03]: crumble the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you get a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you have big round tiger striped
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that I like to do that you may
wanna do, when you think the seeds are
[SPEAKER_03]: getting close to ready, you'll be able to
see them in the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with going to a
lower part of the plant and popping out
[SPEAKER_03]: one seed every now and then and
investigating it until you think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better to ruin one or two seeds and
cut down the whole plant early and ruin
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about 30 days after pollination,
I'll go in there and I'll just pull out
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably gonna be white.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably gonna be small.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably not gonna be ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I've got an indicator of where I
am.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna wait until the seeds that I pull
out are hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wanna be able to put it on a table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting at a wooden table.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a wooden table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna set the seed on this table and
push with my finger as hard as I can and I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want that seed to crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I know they're ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't push as hard as you can,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you wanna be able to push nice and
hard on that seed and you don't want them
[SPEAKER_03]: to crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're white, if they're soft,
they're not ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want big, fat, fluffy tiger stripe
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some seeds that I make do not ever get a
tiger stripe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They turn this gray color.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all seeds are gonna get a tiger
stripe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do I need to talk about,
you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that asked for a long podcast,
you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an hour and 11 minutes in and I have
still got a little bit of material.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna thank you guys for listening to
this long episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm starting to get rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to get tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: My voice is wearing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Storing seeds is very easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just keep my seeds in a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep them sealed and I keep them in a
cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually in a very similar place
to where I keep my pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you've got a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next thing to do is to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I wanna mention is please do not
sell untested seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you make some seeds, grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germinate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Write down how many you started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Write down the germination rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't get at least a 70%
germination rate, try two or three times.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't get at least a 70%
germination rate, something's wrong with
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds, they do not need to be sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't sell untested seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flower them all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are hermaphrodites, don't sell
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are not quality seeds that make
quality plants, do not sell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If seven out of 10 of those plants that
come out of there are not something you
[SPEAKER_03]: would be proud of smoking and be proud of
posting a picture of all over Instagram,
[SPEAKER_03]: do not put that seed line out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are better seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can throw seeds away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow them yourself if you want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But please do not put them in the hands of
unsuspecting growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give your seeds away to your
friends if you tell them, hey dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tested this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey dude, I'm not sure what this is gonna
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give those away, but please do not
try to make any money off of untested
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't mislead people with what you're
giving them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you, like I said a minute ago,
it's okay to toss something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you make a cross, if you take pollen
and put it on this plant and you make a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of seeds and you grow a hundred of
those seeds and they are not way improved
[SPEAKER_03]: on what you started with.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the buds that come out of that are not
better than the buds that came from the
[SPEAKER_03]: original female plant, you did not do any
justice to that breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't keep seeds just out of pride.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be prideful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be arrogant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get rid of some shit that is not
contributing to making cannabis a better
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid to toss bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're wasting time growing shitty
seeds, you were cock blocking yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: from growing good seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could throw away that bad shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could plant more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might find fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that I really wanted to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so you got a bunch of seeds
that you made yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step is to grow them and find out
what you made.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always the funnest part right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plant a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what comes from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if you made a whole bunch of freaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if you just made the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what you could have made
until you grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just making seeds for yourself,
you can stop or you can keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step would be to make an F2,
which would be to find a male and a female
[SPEAKER_03]: that have the perfect traits and breed
them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those seeds are called F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find the perfect male and the
perfect female out of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breed those together again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those will be your F3s.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds that come out of there will be
the F3.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea then is to keep going all the way
to F5.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you get to F5, every seed that
you crack will come out looking like a
[SPEAKER_03]: clone of the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have exactly what you want nailed
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, if you're just making these
seeds for your own personal garden,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can stop right here where you are with
this original cross and you can have fun
[SPEAKER_03]: growing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can cross those seeds to more
and you can cross those to other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the options are endless once you get
this far.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've got one more part to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to press pause and take a dab
and a drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I get back, I'm going to talk
about keeping male plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to wrap up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a quick talk about keeping male
plants around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep male plants just like I keep a
female mother plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to keep it in a semi-large pot,
a five gallon or bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can keep it in an air pot or a root
pot, that is ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for that is to keep the plant
from getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like the root pots kind of do a
little bit of root pruning for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plants won't get root bound because
when they do get root bound, you'll start
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing stress problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some plants like to try to auto flower
if they do get root bound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like a big pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a nicely aerated soil or a
soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it makes a little bit of cocoa in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ideal to keep your mother or father
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a father plant is what I would
call this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ideal to keep your mother and father
plants under either 18, six or 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_03]: continuous light.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that I have shifted to that I
learned from DJ Short, I run a 19,
[SPEAKER_03]: five cycle for my mother and father
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like 19 hours on gives them plenty
of time for growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the five hours off gives everything
time to rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody wants time to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants want to sleep and also my
equipment needs some rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the five hour break is good for
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the shorter rest period because
that way I know that none of my plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to decide that they're gonna try to
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I get to keep my mother plants
and father plants forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you do keep a plant for a long
time, if it's around for a long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: the hormones move around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it'll get old and it will try to
flower on you if you give it some
[SPEAKER_03]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes plants will try to auto flower
on you if they get root bound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I try to keep them under the 19 hours
on five hours off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do 18, six or you can do 24 hours
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of these options will work just
depending on the strength of your brain
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've got and what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to keep it in a large pot,
good soil, keep it on a vegetative light
[SPEAKER_03]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then something that I like to do is I
take a lot of clones from it and I like to
[SPEAKER_03]: prune it very often.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also keep a backup of my male plants
somewhere else in a totally different
[SPEAKER_03]: location.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that if something does go wrong with
King Solomon at the A location,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a clone of King Solomon at the B
location just because he's my prize male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as you keep your plant in a
large pot with good soil under a
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetative light, it should continue to
veg indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be able to take clones off of
it forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would feed my mother and father plants
just basic vegetative nutrients,
[SPEAKER_03]: give them grow A and grow B or whatever
grow nutrients you're using, maybe a
[SPEAKER_03]: little cow mag occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like to feed them kelp products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before I take clones, between 12 and
24 hours before cutting clones,
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to spray my plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a kelp product, maybe liquid karma or
something like that, but mix up some
[SPEAKER_03]: liquid karma, adjust the pH and foliar
spray your mother or father plants before
[SPEAKER_03]: taking clones is some great advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The email that I read at the start of the
show actually said that the listener keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: their mother plants in two gallon pots and
keeps them about two feet tall and does
[SPEAKER_03]: some root pruning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that we get a reply from
them and they are going to teach us how to
[SPEAKER_03]: do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will teach you guys how to do that
in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, my throat and my
voice are burnt out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is time for me to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I go, I want to tell you about a
service called Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon is a service that will allow my
listeners to make a financial contribution
[SPEAKER_03]: to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to get rich off this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not asking anybody to pay for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This podcast will always be free because
it comes from my heart and I want
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody that listens to Grow Better
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you feel like this episode was
worth a dollar or two dollars or however
[SPEAKER_03]: much you feel like it was worth,
if you would like to make a contribution,
[SPEAKER_03]: all you have to do is go to patreon.com

[SPEAKER_03]: You can contribute as little as one
dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I honestly don't think there is a
limit on how many zeros you type in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be grateful for a one dollar
contribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm going to do with that dollar,
I am going to continue to keep my website,
[SPEAKER_03]: iregeneticscolorado.com alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That website is where I host this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pay for that website myself out of my
pocket every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is $315 annually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like your help to offset the
cost of my website to keep this podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: coming to you for free.
