[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I feel like I've covered all of
the business here at the start of the show
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work our way into everyone's
favorite section of the podcast That is of
[SPEAKER_01]: course the question and answer portion of
the show I do have a couple of websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main website is irie genetics comm
everything is listed at irie genetics comm
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to the discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to the patreon There's a
link to irie direct to get the beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is at irie genetics comm But
there is also a tab at the top that says
[SPEAKER_01]: grow help or grow questions If you click
on that grow help or grow question tab,
[SPEAKER_01]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send me a grow question if I read
your grow question here on the podcast I
[SPEAKER_01]: will send you a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds at irie direct comm Today's
[SPEAKER_01]: first question came from our friend who is
going to be called deck homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how we say that D comms
deck homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna call you D for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey D Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, make sure you check your inbox and
your spam folder Because you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
irie direct comm One more rambly piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: info before I jump into this question If I
do send you a gift certificate or a coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: code for free seeds at irie direct comm
Please acknowledge that that gift card
[SPEAKER_01]: does come with an expiration date that
will be clearly Documented on the email it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in make sure you acknowledge that
Expiration date because that is real once
[SPEAKER_01]: the coupon code expires I cannot and will
not reissue that coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of reasons for That
mostly logistic reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like having gift certificates just
out floating in the ether and owing people
[SPEAKER_01]: Money essentially owing you seeds off of
my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it challenging to keep inventory
It makes challenging that makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging to predict some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need those to expire So that means I
need you to use those gift certificates
[SPEAKER_01]: before they do expire So please when you
see that expiration date, please use that
[SPEAKER_01]: promptly because I do get emails people
saying hey I didn't use my gift card it
[SPEAKER_01]: expired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you replace it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I cannot And will not do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of logistical reasons
behind that first of all It tells me you
[SPEAKER_01]: did not listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you hey, you got a coupon code for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go use it If you listen to the show,
you probably heard it you got excited you
[SPEAKER_01]: went bought seeds If not, you simply were
not excited enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't hear the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't go grab the beans I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you don't need seeds right now,
but go get them So it tells me you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to the episode and it tells me you
didn't go get your seeds But I need those
[SPEAKER_01]: to expire like I said for logistic reasons
and logistic purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please use them Before they do expire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm gonna ramble about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a side note a side quest if you
will Let's get back on track my dude D
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox check that
spam folder and use that coupon code Make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you use it on the Black Friday month
because you will be able to grab some
[SPEAKER_01]: great deals Where are we the question
goes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you It says much love and
appreciation for you and what you do mucho
[SPEAKER_01]: blessings, bro mucho gratitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I returned the blessings I returned the
Thankfulness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reciprocal is what I'm trying to say
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am high and rambly today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is reciprocated You guys enjoy the
lessons I give and I enjoy the praise and
[SPEAKER_01]: gratitude you send my way So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes two ways It says I thought of a
question this evening as I was getting in
[SPEAKER_01]: my veg tent and my question is What non
growing related items do you use in your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow to help you out?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really good question It said I
really like using zip ties for all sorts
[SPEAKER_01]: of situations that probably When I shop
outside of the grow store for stuff zip
[SPEAKER_01]: ties are one of the first things I buy I
buy a lot of zip ties I use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got ducting hanging from a ceiling I put
an eye hook in the ceiling use a zip tie
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep it in place Lots of zip ties going
on it goes on it says I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: what you use daily or long-term bless up
my friend from D comms or the comms dick
[SPEAKER_01]: homes I'm not trying to say it bro,
but I still love and respect you either
[SPEAKER_01]: way So let's talk about some of the things
that I may use for my grow that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily designed or created or
intended or sold as grow room items
[SPEAKER_01]: everything we buy for the grow is more
expensive because The people that made it
[SPEAKER_01]: and the people that sold it to us know
we're going to grow cannabis with it So
[SPEAKER_01]: they just charge us extra for it any
cannabis growing item cost ten twenty
[SPEAKER_01]: percent more than it should Simply because
they know what we were gonna do with it If
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't for growing the same exact
freaking item would be ten twenty percent
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper You can go get it almost every
store except.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a specialized item today Mark it up
just because they know what we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: which is unfair, but it's America.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how some shit works So there are
many items we can buy that don't come from
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow store that you can get at your
big box store Maybe a local mom-and-pop
[SPEAKER_01]: shop that will help us and our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a short list here Let's just talk
about things that are not necessarily grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room specific devices that I rely on and
do use The first thing on my list was door
[SPEAKER_01]: security.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little sensor thing It just
it's got one piece and another piece one
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on The door frame one goes on the
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a magnet on it when they click
together This little dot turns off when
[SPEAKER_01]: they unclick the red dot lights up and I
get a notification on my phone Door
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors door alarms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my grow room doors open I know it my
phone beeps and I go who the fuck is in my
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room The next thing that goes with
that wise cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like cameras in the grow So if
that thing beeps and says hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's someone around I can look and see
who the fuck is around I keep a so I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a pretty decent sized grow room with
Multiple tents in that room I've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: camera in each tent the veg and the flower
and I like to have a camera in the main
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the room as well so I can see if
there's We'll talk about another thing
[SPEAKER_01]: here in a second, but I can see what's
going on in that room So if I do get a
[SPEAKER_01]: notification then I can open up the
cameras and I can look and see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening Another thing I'm gonna talk
about am I going in order because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if I am I'm gonna skip something One
thing that just came to my mind to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you about is water sensors and all of your
hardware stores even on Amazon You can buy
[SPEAKER_01]: water and moisture sensors So if you're
running a reservoir or if you're running
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that automatically fills up,
you've got an RO system You've got water
[SPEAKER_01]: running to that constantly it fills up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's filling a reservoir You should have a
float valve to make that stop Sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: that will fail that float valve is gonna
fuck up one time You're gonna get water
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on vacation Maybe you're out
running errands, whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you went to get some tacos Everyone
loves tacos, but whatever you're out doing
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've got a moisture sensor on the
floor where moisture should not get to
[SPEAKER_01]: When water hits that guess what your
phone's gonna ding you're gonna get a
[SPEAKER_01]: notification Pull out your phone open your
ways cameras or your wise cameras and look
[SPEAKER_01]: to see is there water somewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: That water sensor will ding your phone and
let you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, there's water in places It shouldn't
be I use those in my grow, but I also have
[SPEAKER_01]: a leaky pipe in my basement There's an
area that is known to kind of cause a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem So in any time water starts to
happen there that fucking moisture sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: goes off and tells me so that if I'm
Sleeping if I'm across town if I'm at the
[SPEAKER_01]: store if I'm at the store I could just get
right back to where the grow is either one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the grows and I can fix that water and
not cause More problems because water can
[SPEAKER_01]: really destroy some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So door security is one of the first
things I like Water sensors and cameras
[SPEAKER_01]: are things that I really like then let's
work on another really important thing
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke detectors I really like some sort of
smoke detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of electricity going on in
that room Even if you just have one light
[SPEAKER_01]: and a fan, that's a lot of electricity
running in a grow room I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in a closet a bedroom or Whatever,
but we don't want to be the person that
[SPEAKER_01]: causes a fire in the neighborhood because
we were cultivating cannabis That's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad look on the entire community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bad look on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a rough look my dude So don't be
the person catching a fire starting a fire
[SPEAKER_01]: in your cultivation room, especially in a
residential area So I recommend a smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: detector that way if something does
happen, you could put that shit out as
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly as possible How are you gonna do
that with the next piece of advice?
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend the next piece of equipment
would be A fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a fire extinguisher outside of the
grow space If you walk up to my main grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room right outside on the floor,
I know it's on the floor I could kick it
[SPEAKER_01]: and trip it where it is I won't but
there's a fire extinguisher right on the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor if some shit goes wrong I can pick
up the fire extinguisher pull the pin Kick
[SPEAKER_01]: the door like the fucking FBI and go in
and just start spraying and praying and
[SPEAKER_01]: handle some shit So where are we so far
door security?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know if people come and go?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they come and go you want a camera so
you can look at them if shit floods you
[SPEAKER_01]: want a water Sensor also in that water
sensor goes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty simple smoke alarm We want
to know if a fire happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a smoke alarm that hooks up
to my phone It's simply fucking loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I'm here or there or wherever
the fire happens hopefully there's no fire
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest with you, but Do they make
and sell a smoke detector that hooks up to
[SPEAKER_01]: your phone yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be something, you know,
it's gonna happen My AC infinity monitor
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna let me know it's a hundred and
seventy thousand degrees in there It will
[SPEAKER_01]: beep and tell me so we do have some sort
of fire warning if we are Away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a smoke detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a fire extinguisher Now we're just
gonna work our way into other random.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are big things I thought we should
definitely cover safety safety is
[SPEAKER_01]: important safety and security Door locks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have good locks on your doors?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more shit to think about I did not
even write down locking doorknobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are important But then I really like
the spin mop the spin mop is just another
[SPEAKER_01]: random fun thing that I've bought for my
grow It's got the thing that spins inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you use the mop you get that shit dirty
and then you stick it in the one part and
[SPEAKER_01]: you Hit the pedal and it spins the thing
around and cleans your mop for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like this spin mop They don't
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't work for spin mop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't worry I don't nobody pays me to
advertise except I read genetics because I
[SPEAKER_01]: own the damn company, but spin mop is a
great fucking product It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheap and it it makes things easier
You know the janitor bucket if you can if
[SPEAKER_01]: you got a big space get the janitor bucket
spin mops a small version of that It's
[SPEAKER_01]: carry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's portable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to use and it's you got
to mop the damn floor And if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: easier gear to access and use you're more
likely to use it So the spin mop that was
[SPEAKER_01]: a fun Little investment also something I
use a whole bunch in the grow space is a
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor stool if you got that little
rollable Rolling adjustable doctor stool
[SPEAKER_01]: that will save your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll save your legs Sometimes I'm just
scooting all the way across the floor I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to stand up and go over there
to get the scissors and come back I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: roll my high ass right across the floor
get them launch myself right back,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that doctor stool really helps a lot I
don't need to be standing all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to be hunched over and bent
over a little doctor stool makes things a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot easier For me, there are a lot of
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the doctor stool works great for
what I'm trying to do The next thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a whole bunch in my grow space and
this is not grow related But how I said if
[SPEAKER_01]: you enjoy being in there You'll be in
there more which some of you just need to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the fuck out of the grow and quit
messing with the plants But if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: work to do like popping twisting
lollipopping Defoliating working the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants into the trellis net, which I
really enjoy doing The environment helps a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really nice to be in there
something I'm gonna add right now glasses
[SPEAKER_01]: good grow Room sunglasses they make
specific glasses to protect you from the
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum of light which you are using if
you're using HPS LED ceramic metal halide
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a pair of glasses to protect you
from that spectrum Our eyes are the most
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive organs on our body that are
exposed to the elements and also one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most critical Senses we've got for
survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So protect your eyes invest in your eyes
get some good glasses to cover your eyes
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing I wanted to say if we're
Gonna be in there a lot make it
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable jam some good music get a good
Bluetooth speaker for the grow space
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not unheard of at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Bluetooth speakers are so affordable
You can get a good cheap speaker for like
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 bucks at the gas station and it's gonna
bump You could get something really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: at Target or at Home Depot But those $20
little pieces of shit at the gas station
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna bump and give you some music
Especially if you're just listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow from your heart podcast There's no
super sound quality to try to put out here
[SPEAKER_01]: other than my voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need Like cool bass riffs or
there's no guitar chucking through so just
[SPEAKER_01]: a decent speaker will make it go a long
way some Gentle entertainment in the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space or some air pods one of the two
Little little Bluetooth speaker or some
[SPEAKER_01]: air pods you can get some music or a
podcast going that'll encourage you to go
[SPEAKER_01]: in there Sometimes I'm like I just want to
listen to this podcast I'm gonna go
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliate just so I have something to do
while I listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get some music going in there I don't
care if it's Bluetooth speakers or air
[SPEAKER_01]: pods get some sound happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make you feel better and you'll
enjoy Your time in there then other things
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna talk about You line is your
hero if you're a weed grower You probably
[SPEAKER_01]: get a catalog from you line in the mail
about once a month with all their cool
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that they offer you They offer some
cool things out for a push cart that I
[SPEAKER_01]: really like you can load up all your
nutrients on the bottom of that You could
[SPEAKER_01]: put a bunch of stuff on the bottom of the
cart all the heavy stuff and then up top
[SPEAKER_01]: Put like your scissors a box of gloves
your drink can go up there your Bluetooth
[SPEAKER_01]: speaker I got a little cart that I just
push around it makes life so much easier
[SPEAKER_01]: if I need Something it's on the cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know most of what I need is probably on
the cart and I can roll the cart from room
[SPEAKER_01]: to room Wherever I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my stuff can be close to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put a lot of things on that cart I
clean the cart you guys the cart gets
[SPEAKER_01]: messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put your food and stuff on there I
just said have your drink on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no Doritos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a sprayer I got some scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got gloves the Bluetooth speaker sits
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My phone is probably on there There's a
pen and a pad of paper for some notes just
[SPEAKER_01]: all the random shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My glasses will be sitting on there Just
random shits on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that little cart makes life easy Just
push it around from room to room from grow
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow space to space I mix in another
area so I can roll it over the mix area
[SPEAKER_01]: and then bring it It provides a lot of
purpose I can set a five gallon bucket on
[SPEAKER_01]: it and carry like eight five gallon
buckets on there No problem get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling cart from you line or a little
basket of some sort just to carry your
[SPEAKER_01]: shit around You save a lot of time not
going to get individual items all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: like in my clone area my Cloning happens
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my nutrients are in one area my
mix area My cloning stuff the the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: gel the clone X and the pH down and the pH
pen are in It's a thing I got it came from
[SPEAKER_01]: Target.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it's designed to go in the
shower It looks like it could hang right
[SPEAKER_01]: on the shower head and hold your shampoos
and your loofah and whatever but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly big enough to hold the pH down
the Clone X gel the clone X juice a pair
[SPEAKER_01]: of scissors a pH pen and a box of gloves
all fit perfectly in this like Little
[SPEAKER_01]: shower rack thing and that just hangs on
the wall by my cloner It was designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be for the shower, you know You put your
shampoos and all that stuff in there girls
[SPEAKER_01]: probably hang a plant in there I've got
all my cloning stuff right there so that
[SPEAKER_01]: if I do decide to move the cloner to
another area Just grab that all my cloning
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies come with me makes it super
fucking easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little u-line basket a shower
organizer I've got this the shower
[SPEAKER_01]: organizer is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Where else do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um something that I Buy quite often
that is not definitely not meant to be for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and you'll see this In so many
grows is beer cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy a lot of beer cups The red solo
party cups or even the rainbow pack will
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what color they are But I
like to use those cups to put my little
[SPEAKER_01]: baby clones in If I cut clones right when
I put them into their first pot They go
[SPEAKER_01]: into a beer cup a lot of the time One
thing I should stress is poke holes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms of those beer cups I usually take
a drill and I can stack up a bunch and
[SPEAKER_01]: just put one big hole through The bottom
and then do a couple more just rant right
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle and then a couple randomly
through there You want drainage?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also seen guys heat up a hot poker
and just push a poker through a big stack
[SPEAKER_01]: of cups However, that's gonna stink it's
gonna make smoke be forewarned But put
[SPEAKER_01]: holes in those beer cups and they work
perfectly for little containers for small
[SPEAKER_01]: plants I've done full breeding projects
and beer cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to think about I'm not
gonna tell you too much about that now but
[SPEAKER_01]: beer cups and a drill just get some beer
cups and a drill and you can make Like 52
[SPEAKER_01]: pots for like eight bucks You know,
it's not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bad itch on my ankle ankle here I
hope this doesn't disrupt the show that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably looked weird, but it feels
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um duct tape you guys duct tape and zip
ties are your hero I don't know who said
[SPEAKER_01]: it but someone one wise man It might have
been Confucius Confucius once said if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't duck it fuck it So get some duct
tape you can fix almost everything in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow space Get some of that aluminum like
the foil tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cut your fingers on it real good
get some of that tape that stuff sticks to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything You can fix a lot of shit with
that that and duct tape and zip ties bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot go wrong Everything is fixable
with duct tape and zip ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also something I use you're gonna say bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're six foot five Why do you have one
of these because sometimes there should I
[SPEAKER_01]: need to get to I have a step stool Just a
little it's a shitty step stool from a
[SPEAKER_01]: Home Depot and I use it way more than you
might imagine Yeah, I'm six five But
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes just getting up above the light
and be able to being able to work on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the light without being on my tippy
toes Makes it a lot freakin easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe a little Step stool one of those
folding Get the size you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I'm talking about But if you
need to get up top and get some shit go
[SPEAKER_01]: get a step stool Don't be shy a little
trash can for the girl was always nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: too I put a trash can with the trash bag
in it Anytime I defoliate or whatever if
[SPEAKER_01]: you use some of that silver tape,
it's got a backing need a trash can I
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend a trash can with the lid and a
bag and get rid of that trash every day
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that trash out of your grow room not
just out of the grow but if you can get it
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the house the Facility whatever get
rid of it as far as you can from your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the bugs go to those dead leaves
outside instead of in your environment
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just asking for problems with dead
leaves and foliage around So a little
[SPEAKER_01]: trash can and some trash bags and a duct
tape or in some duct tape are always your
[SPEAKER_01]: friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um I did not write this on here But I just
thought of this all of us growers get
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking sticky trim time is sticky working
is sticky We need something to clean all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stickiness off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a bottle of coconut oil go to your
local health food store Or the Whole Foods
[SPEAKER_01]: or sprouts or natural grocers,
whatever you got in your neighborhood Go
[SPEAKER_01]: get a jar of coconut oil when your fingers
are super sticky when my arm hair is
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky I'll just take coconut oil and just
give myself one of these and just give it
[SPEAKER_01]: a good rub and all That stickiness will
come right off then you got to wash with
[SPEAKER_01]: soap and water after that But coconut oil
will get rid of all that stickiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps a lot It will also help to clean
your scissors and all of your other gear
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you got some sticky shit coconut oil
if you want to clean surfaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when I recommend 91% ISO Try not to
put the ISO on your skin Although it
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be a surprise to walk into the
room and catch me washing my hands with
[SPEAKER_01]: straight ISO because I'm fucking sticky
Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your skin means more to you than that Do
as I say not as I do some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned it from you dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where are we a pH pen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I recommend just getting a new pH and
an EC pen I recently bought one that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is EC pH and temperature all at the
same time I drop one thing in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's It tells me everything I need to know
that one tool makes me save a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes every day Which is encouraging it
makes me want to play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have a new toy that works real
Well, let's stick it in the water See what
[SPEAKER_01]: the EC pH and temperature are all in one
move instead of having to dump multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: devices in here Get yourself a good
reliable EC and pH meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will make your life much better and
I'll make the plants happier We're banging
[SPEAKER_01]: off shit on this list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Dude something something I use a lot in
a game Commercial or in a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial or homegrown environment is
coat hangers when I harvest my plants I
[SPEAKER_01]: put them on coat hangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just chop them and hang them up on coat
hangers I buy a lot of coat hangers for
[SPEAKER_01]: grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, here's a dad hack Take a coat hanger
right get the plastic kind or even the old
[SPEAKER_01]: metal ones will work for this matter Get
the plastic coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the piece that comes down It's
got the part where your clothing would
[SPEAKER_01]: hang cut that part out Just get I use the
snips that I cut the fucking plants down
[SPEAKER_01]: with clip that bitch off there clip it off
there now You got your coat hanger that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes like this with the Big gap put a roll
of paper towels in that gap and hang that
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch up what free idea there for you
That's probably the best advice I gave you
[SPEAKER_01]: in this whole episode Take a coat hanger
cut out the middle part slap on a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: roll of paper towels You've got an awesome
paper towel hanger for the grow space
[SPEAKER_01]: right there fucking genius, dude Also
something else I use a lot that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get at Walmart Target anywhere that sells
fucking cheap plastic items Amazon is good
[SPEAKER_01]: for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The container store has got them they are
under the bed bins designed to put your
[SPEAKER_01]: clothing or Whatever you want to store
under the bed, but they're real shallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I don't know I want to say
six eight, maybe nine inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that far Six or eight
nine inches deep and they're like two feet
[SPEAKER_01]: long and a foot wide maybe 18 inches wide
But I like those for putting all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit in there I can fit I think you can
fit 48 maybe 24 48 beer cups perfectly in
[SPEAKER_01]: the tray that I'm talking about So if you
just want to fill one of those up do a
[SPEAKER_01]: little fino hunt Maybe a quick breeding
run in beer cups that stir light tray will
[SPEAKER_01]: hold a bunch of cups perfectly Also when
I'm harvesting I'll chop down plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: put it right into that bin and let it sit
there till it dries Sometimes it will work
[SPEAKER_01]: in a pinch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also when I'm harvesting for seeds,
I hang the plant up tilts dry Once it's
[SPEAKER_01]: dry enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in that bin so that I do not lose
my seeds They don't fall out of anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: except into that bin Then I'll take gloves
and bust all the buds off the sticks into
[SPEAKER_01]: that bin Then grind it all up real fine
into that bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got all my material in my seeds in
that bin That's how I keep that bin of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds kind of isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use a lot of stir light Trays,
they sell a bunch of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will make your trim life in your
storage life much easier Also,
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a lot of ball jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought of that because I could see ball
jars There's a box of ball jars sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My long-term storage goes in ball jars or
turkey bags Get you some turkey bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be hard right now at this time
of year, but or maybe it's easier I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're available Turkey bags are
great for storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I gave you the paper towel hanger
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the best one You're gonna
get all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you About stir light bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you about the hangers you guys I
think we have covered most of my ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've got for Items we can use that
are not meant for the grow room things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can reallocate for grow room purposes

[SPEAKER_01]: a podcast call to action.
