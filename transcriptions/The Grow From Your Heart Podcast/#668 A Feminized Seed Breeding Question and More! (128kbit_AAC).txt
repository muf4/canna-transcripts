help me make some decisions on some
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of cool stuff happening
on the Discord channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do exclusive drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let people know that things are coming
up on the Discord channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another avenue to find some
exclusive drops, exclusive information.

[SPEAKER_00]: editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check us out on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a greenhouse today and those
plants are taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording on August 27th and today
the plants are going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the plants are kicking into the
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to make big fuzzy
pistols, look like they got dandelions on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are kicking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of strains,
however, that are lagging a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just stretching like crazy right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they'll catch up, but it is an
exciting time for the greenhouse grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun to be out there getting my
shoes dirty, getting a sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving the greenhouse life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were asking me to do some
episodes about things that I have already
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outdoor season is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every outdoor season I get asked for a
couple of outdoor episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then toward the end of the season,
I get asked for a couple of very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already done those episodes that I
have in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them I've only done in audio
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done them in the new video
format, but a lot of old episodes are
[SPEAKER_00]: available on the YouTube channel and in
the server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you're listening or watching this
podcast from, to however you do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to, watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I meant to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you're enjoying this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of old episodes that may
include some of the grow advice and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons and answers to questions which you
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the old episodes is
what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 668 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there are 667 other episodes
that may have some answers that you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't heard yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I have done a lot of
episodes that I haven't converted to video
[SPEAKER_00]: format yet or redone in the video format,
I will get to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying not to repeat myself too
much, but it is time I've got to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: re-loop around and do some of those old
episodes over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be time to update some of those
older episodes, but don't forget to check
[SPEAKER_00]: the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a quick Google search.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find an episode about the question
you've got in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't forget about that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a screenshot on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody sent me a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a quick screenshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the most efficient way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from our friend,
I don't know if they want their name said,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, what's up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your opinion, is the Hella Dank seed
company a legit seed bank?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they carry legit irie genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hella Dank seed company is a
legitimate vendor for irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great seed vendor, a great seed
bank, a great seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get stuff out to you quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a good selection, a good
variety and good fair pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do support them, endorse them,
promote them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are part of the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you can verify a vendor
by checking my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually have most of the vendors updated
on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm still auditioning a vendor
so I may not add them right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they do, they do sell a few packs
and make a couple of orders and they show
[SPEAKER_00]: me that they have good quality customer
service and they don't embarrass me in any
[SPEAKER_00]: way or frustrate my customers,
then I do add them to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably one or two maybe three
that need to be added to the website right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't sent them to the web guy to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I send him an email,
he'll probably get them up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get the Canadian link up
there and a couple of others really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just got to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an official Canadian distributor
and there are probably seven official
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors on the website now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is if you ever want to
know if a vendor is an official vendor of
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetics, all you've got to do is hit
my website and on the website there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: list of vendors and most of them are
listed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company you asked about is listed
there in the top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're one of the top three or top five
vendors of my seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a legitimate seed vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the website and most of the brands,
the vendors will be updated pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send the email to get them all on
there because they do approve and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to add them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canada link will have a lot of people
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Hela Dank Seed Company is
official.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to check out seeds here now
dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Golden Ticket Seed Company,
Heritage Seed Bank, El Fuego Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chi Town Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm skipping one and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did that off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I missed your seed brand, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got some Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said we were going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of great messages here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you guys showed up for the
question portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend Kyle This one
came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, what's up Kyle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Says I can't thank you enough for all of
the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening and keep supporting on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I heard about you from the DGC
and I have really enjoyed your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you make sure you support the
Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Guru and then a big special fist
bump to everybody behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an editor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing all that stuff by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome for making it easy for those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going because obviously I'm
stoned and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I listen to the podcast in a loop
throughout the day and soak in the info
[SPEAKER_00]: even when I already know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may catch a weird detail or
something you didn't hear the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: and I enjoy the clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making my numbers go up,
making my stats climb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that and you're just
filling your head with great knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm 42 years old and I'm growing
my own plants here in VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to say that out loud because I
think they are illegal now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's growing his plants in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's 42 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, it's hard to believe that I can
legally grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just three years ago, not far from me,
this door was kicked in and I was taken to
[SPEAKER_00]: jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it weird how just like just one rule
or one scribble of a paper or one click of
[SPEAKER_00]: approval can change everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it feels like to have a chain
put on the door and the door just flies
[SPEAKER_00]: off and a bunch of noise and commotions
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what's going on and the
dogs running down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no front door on the house and
suddenly you're on the fucking floor in
[SPEAKER_00]: handcuffs and all your friends are looking
at you like what the fuck just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then like a week later they signed
papers that say we won't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can smoke and grow all the weed
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking weird how paper works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, I have fallen in love
with the plant, the plant culture and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, welcome to my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me feeling good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It builds a good community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've built a business and a lifestyle
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely know how you feel,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it is therapeutic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the most therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing it is more therapeutic than
smoking cannabis, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question is a little different
and I like different questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, how do you manage the personal
aspect of this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, socially, when you meet somebody
new, how do you introduce this into the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is legal for me and I have 10 of your
strains and I'm debating which one to pop
[SPEAKER_00]: in my next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a ramble, but if it's a commitment
to grow this plant properly and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want, but it is a commitment to grow the
plant properly and I don't want to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly come up with excuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious what your thoughts may
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a couple of ways to go about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the question is how do you
bring up cannabis in your conversations,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your social circle, and then also how
do you bring up that you grow cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: your social circle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the best bet is to just not
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what the climate's like where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe ask some baited questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be too obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself set up for anything,
but maybe when you're in your social
[SPEAKER_00]: circle, when you're in your group,
be like, you see they legalized weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get answers from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you have to do is bring it up
or just be some more and let them bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to spark that
conversation, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spark that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to spark that
conversation, let them bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potheads love to talk about pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love to talk about pot so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're emailing me to talk about pot,
to ask about how to talk about pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone's going to bring it up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody will bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't want to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some stuff to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell people that you don't know,
trust and probably love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even tell people that you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for people to know that
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it is legal, it's still a
profitable commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may want to steal it from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may want to just fuck with you just
because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't like you from high school
still, and now they know you grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to make shit go wrong because
they don't like you and they don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody that you don't need to
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't know it's there,
they don't know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't know it's there,
they don't know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't know it's there,
they can't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be two different
boundaries here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be three different boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do we talk about cannabis with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do we get political and have fun
conversations and make them part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: team and be like, Hey, I want to talk
about weed and weed politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find some of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to have another layer of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do we actually smoke with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cause that's going to come up once
they start saying, Hey, do you see there's
[SPEAKER_00]: legal weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: One person in that group is going to go,
fuck yeah, I'm so glad it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting to smoke and that
conversation is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't say around everybody like
we'll go smoke later, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until you break off into your own
little groups or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people that don't smoke or they
were not with the right ideas with you and
[SPEAKER_00]: they walk away and stick around and be
like, Hey bro, let's, let's burn one
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow after work or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed heads unite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already found us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't tell anybody that doesn't need to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to find your social
circle to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find your smoking circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then who are you going to share the grow
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, everybody knows I grow because of who
I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I am and how, uh, what I've been
for this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded really egotistical.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been for this community,
uh, how outspoken I've been for this
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, uh, I was involved in the first
dispensary in my city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on the news smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: News cameras have been at the fucking
house where we smoked and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people know who I am and what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I've got to follow the damn
rule so closely now, but, uh, I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wish I wasn't under the spotlight so much
sometimes, uh, under the magnifying glass
[SPEAKER_00]: because, uh, I will be a very good example
if I need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to follow the rules very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so don't make it known that you're
growing unless you need to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't tell, I don't know if you're
married, single, got kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a dog, um, my advice right now
is just tell the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog is the only one that needs to know
you and the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's such the greatest secret
that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're going to make friends with
somebody who's really super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day you'll feel like it's time to
share that garden, but let that be like
[SPEAKER_00]: your secret Zen thing that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your new, your new secret,
just your new little zone in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was growing illegally before
growing was fully legal, it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like my little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was like, yeah, I'm in here doing
this and nobody can know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fun to have a little private
project, a little secret thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you have to make excuses,
uh, who are you making excuses to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you making excuses to go burn one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you making excuses because you've got
to go water?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the struggles of being a
grower is having to sneak away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got to go check on my fucking
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here in Colorado, we look at our
phone and we say, Oh, my pulse monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to go take care of my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my way out of a conversation or out
of a boring situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to find the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, Oh shit, my plants have an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to figure out how to get out of
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, my dog just called me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go take care of my dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, excuses are going to be harder to
find, but be creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to take care of the plants,
uh, early in the morning before everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else is up before work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get in there, take care of
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody will interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nobody's trying to get your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not cutting out of other time when
people think you should be somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if you got to do too much sneaky
shit, that's when you got to kind of think
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you're doing also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, uh, coming up with excuses,
mainly just keep your mouth shut,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to tell everybody about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even your girlfriend, not your best
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what happens if you and that girl
break up and she knows that grow was
[SPEAKER_00]: there, she may cause some problems for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you tell your bro and one day he
decides he's not your bro anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like shit goes wrong, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some years on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 42 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so maybe hopefully you got some wisdom
by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hopefully you got a good group of
friends, maybe a trusty friend circle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still, uh, these types of things
change circles and it's a new market where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, it may be, uh, you may be wanting
to get in on the ground floor of these new
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like a smart person and you're
growing and you need people to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up a social smoking club or a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you meet all kinds of people
to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also how you make a business
out of something you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't even have to explain it
to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go, that's the guy with the
dispensary downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be providing a service that
makes you feel good that you're passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what life is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came to me at the end of that
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I let that one come through me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, uh, bro, thank you for the
great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how do I handle the social aspect of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this, uh, let it evolve naturally and
mostly to keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell too many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, um, it's fun to smoke with other
people, but it sounds like you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking by yourself for a long time and
that you can keep doing that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until somebody, until somebody else admits
that they're a smoker, then bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Kyle, thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to, uh, taking a fat dab
with you someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, man, let's move on to the next
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a friend who is calling
themselves trike, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that if I've ever that I've
ever met trike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man before sounds like a super cool
superhero name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big shout out to trike man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to picture your superhero
costume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it gets Amber as you get fucking angry
or super powered starts off clear and your
[SPEAKER_00]: power builds up and starts getting Amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's what trike man would do in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you took some dabs and I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's read this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope all is well, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously things are well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, things are iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says big ups to the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trike man here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a little question about
stabilizing genetics with reversing
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a big mouthful, but it's
really not that much to think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, stabilizing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, basically the goal, I think when you
are talking about stabilizing is growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: population of seeds and hoping that they
come out uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's what I think you're saying when
you say stabilizing genetics and then with
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is taking a female plant and using
silver diosulfate or colloidal colloidal
[SPEAKER_00]: silver to induce that plant to create
pollen sacks and then pollinating female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with that, which I do like the
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good way to stabilize and
lock in traits without, uh, opening up
[SPEAKER_00]: Pandora's box says, so here's a little
example of what I am curious about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say I start by making my cross with a male
and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've got a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, next I search for what my goal in that
breeding project was.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got the phenotype that
was our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there, I want to reverse that
female that I selected and breed that to
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That so now we've made a plant that is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a plant that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our friend wants to take two clones of
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basically going to cut a branch
here and a branch here and we got two cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to reverse one using the
reversal method that I've talked about in
[SPEAKER_00]: previous episodes, either silver
thiosulfate or colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to put the pollen that
comes from that plant onto the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would just reversed one pollinated
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now made an S one or maybe a
feminized F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may say, we're going to talk
about that in depth in the future here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get some other folks on the show,
but I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'm going to catch up in the
message search for what my goal was from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to reverse that female and breed it
to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes perfect sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, do I breed the next
generation to the first generation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed the first time or do I reverse
the next generation and cross it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of itself again and keep doing that
or keep reading the next generation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: first female I selected and reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you for everything you do,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you feel iry about the rest of your
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect from trike man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of good answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's how you're going to find what
works the best is do all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do have some more in depth answers
to this cause I know you want more
[SPEAKER_00]: details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you want to, you want to continue
breeding with this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse all the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about those dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at the phase where they fuck up
my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you've got is a feminized F one or
it's an S one cause it's been selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is going to be fairly uniform or
fairly stable in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've selected good plants or a good
plant is what this would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're probably going to get
approximately 50 to 70% of your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like your starter plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, probably 50 is a
possibility, but 50 to 30% of those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to look a little bit like the
mother that was used to make that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and the father that was used to make that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of finding a good parent stock from
F two and make the F three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you really start locking
in those, uh, the, uh, stability,
the stability of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the
[SPEAKER_00]: of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
of the, of the, of the, of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could take a batch of those seeds
and grow them and find a male and a female
[SPEAKER_00]: or I guess find an ideal female in there
or you could find an ideal two females and
[SPEAKER_00]: you could cross that however you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find one and resell fit or you
can find two and cross those together and
[SPEAKER_00]: make the next generation however you'd
like or you can do that back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take something from the second
generation and put it back to that first
[SPEAKER_00]: generation you made or back to one of
those parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is something that I don't talk
about a lot but here's something I
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a plant and it was a beautiful
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was everything I was looking for in a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made feminized F1s or S1s out of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my feminized seed stock and I
did sort of what you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the winner out of that number nine
was the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took number nine and then I took the
original pollen from the first making of
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed and I pollinated number nine
with the pollen from its mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that reversed pollen went on number
nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically the mom went on to the
daughter essentially and the offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: that came from that were labeled number
77.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good one my favorite one that came out
of that was labeled number 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was calling the whole batch the 77s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was related to some other stuff is
why I got that number and if you know why
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number 77 would not reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doesn't depending on what your goal is
if you want to keep moving forward you may
[SPEAKER_00]: be stuck because I can't breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't breed with 77 for a long time
because it wouldn't turn around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not reverse it to make pollen from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I trapped myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut off my breeding project right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I did that I'll repeat that
process because I probably got your
[SPEAKER_00]: attention more now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the feminized cross just like you
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a plant took two clones pollen and
pollen receiver that made seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a seed from that batch and I found
a stellar keeper that looked a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: the original plant I started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the pollen from the original mom
and put that onto the daughter plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: the offspring the granddaughters that came
out I'd be mommy daughter granddaughter at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The granddaughters don't reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I spray them with silver thiosulfate
they don't react the way that most plants
[SPEAKER_00]: react.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I really locked in the
feminized side of that plant to where I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't even get it to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's how stubbornly feminized that
plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may trap yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may end your breeding right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say well I can't reverse this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do all of these ways that you want
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the traits that you're
searching for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the traits that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've made the S1 or the feminized F1
are the traits you're looking for showing
[SPEAKER_00]: very commonly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they prominent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they popping up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deciding the next move is all about
where are the traits that you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the trait you're looking for in
a lot of the seeds you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the traits you're looking for
in the mother plant that you started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the traits you're looking for
maybe in the father plant that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: original pollen donor in the original
non-feminized cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: What where is the trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that trait get that ingredient and
then breed that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a better more solid answer
but I don't know which plants look the
[SPEAKER_00]: best and which plants have your goal but
that is the plant you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are on the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of good ideas and I know
I said it earlier the answer is yes and
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer is to do all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to decide what to do
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read it again and see if I
can give you a better definitive answer
[SPEAKER_00]: but without looking at the plants and
without saying this one's got that
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry turp that I'm after or this
one's got that purple color that I'm after
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to pick for you but go for the
plants that have the traits which you were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for and then keep locking in that
trait and then deciding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah if you want to move forward with
the feminized generations or go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: another plant where are the ingredients
that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they forward or are they back there
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the seeds show you what you want or do
you need to put another ingredient in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to figure it out really
honestly is to breed it and grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to scan over the message real
quick and make sure that I got the answer
[SPEAKER_00]: to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right I think I'm more than covered
the answer to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about finding where the traits
are that you want to lock in and then use
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants to create the results that
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd find great results in the S2
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think you'd find great results in
the I would be a reversed back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd find great results in both
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play with both of them if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly you're going to have great
results with that very first feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're going to see great
results it's not going to be wonky or
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find a bunch of
mutants unless unless you're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were wonky and mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you sound like a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you probably did good
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're thinking ahead which
is very great because a lot of breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you're on the right path and I
think it's just the plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a better answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could tell you do three shakes of
this ingredient three shakes of this and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all about seeing those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which way do you need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the plants showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the parents showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get very familiar with all of the plants
and then you'll know what they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just be able to tell like if you
grow this this female plant so many times
[SPEAKER_00]: and this female plant so many times and
you cross this one to this one and this
[SPEAKER_00]: one to this one and that one to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start knowing what this plant
contributes to crosses and you'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to predict it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost it's almost becomes
predictable once you've bred with a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend trike man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to the response from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more follow up questions
please do ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got kind of carried away and
rambly.
