[SPEAKER_02]: The grow from your heart podcast starts
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 816 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a fun show lined up for us in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about a
vacation I recently took.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to talk a little bit
about adjusting our grow room for the
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming winter conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in the United States,
we are now shifting from that warm summer
[SPEAKER_00]: season to the cooler fall season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to make some adjustments in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start the show by talking about
a little vacation that I got to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, I got to go to Las Vegas and
see a festival called Skank Fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skank Fest is not exactly what it sounds
like, but it is close to what it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a big fan of a podcast called the
Legion of Skanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legion of Skanks is one of my favorite
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hosted by Louis J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gomez, Big J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson, and Dave Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they have a lot of great
comedians as guests on our podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it's East Coast Comics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys aren't as gentle and fluffy as
some of the other guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the rude, crass humor that these
guys put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Legion of Skanks threw a festival
called Skank Fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was their seventh Skank Fest they've
thrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the second one that happened in
Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw the lineup, I knew that I
had to go to this party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skank Fest was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could start listing comedians that were
there, and I'm going to miss a bunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of the comedians that were there
that you may have heard of are Louis J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gomez, Big J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okerson, Dave Smith, Mark Norman,
Joe DeRosa, Joe List, and then there were
[SPEAKER_00]: old school comedians like somebody you may
have heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lady named Roseanne Barr.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Roseanne from TV fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did some standup comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a guest on the Legion of Skanks
live podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing to see Roseanne there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Drew was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Drew did the Dr. Drew After Dark
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys, there was a wrestling
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a mixed martial arts match
during Skank Fest during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that match, the competitors were
blindfolded and wearing shock collars,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the controllers of the shock collars
were given to random members of the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the guys were put into a boxing
ring and they were fighting sort of Royal
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumble style, about seven on seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of dudes just fighting until
people gave up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in the ring blindfolded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wearing shock collars, doing a mixed
martial arts match.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was every bit as chaotic and
entertaining as it does sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for that event, Dr. Drew Pinsky did
sing the national anthem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all might not know that Dr. Drew is an
amazing opera singer, but Dr. Drew,
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy from Love Line, the guy that
teaches us about problems with our pecker
[SPEAKER_00]: and all kinds of weird sexual talk,
that guy is an amazing opera singer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he opened the Ellis Mania fights with
the national anthem and he did an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our buddy Dr. Drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Ron White was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys know Ron White or
Tater Salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not on the schedule, but I was in a
room watching comedy, was waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: another comedian to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the host said, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a special surprise for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron White.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ron White came out and did several
minutes of amazing comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had me laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that my ass off?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Sam Talent was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam Talent is an amazing up and coming
comic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's super popular in the Colorado
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's becoming more and more popular day by
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on Joe Rogan, so he's definitely
expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sam Talent was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Dillon was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I could list comedians all
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremiah Watkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else was there that I was just trying
to think of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh Potter was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brennan Schaub and Brian Callan were
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody would perform on these little
theater stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after they performed,
they were just hanging out in the hallways
[SPEAKER_00]: with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was rubbing elbows and fist bumping
and smoking joints, allegedly,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of my favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Skankfest was an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were seven different stages and
there was comedy or a podcast happening on
[SPEAKER_00]: every stage at every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they built that boxing ring
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did some mixed martial arts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple other things that
happened out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a booty cheek slapping contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know they do the the face slap
competitions on ESPN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they stand there and they take turns
slapping each other in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some pretty girls do butt cheek
slap competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skankfest was everything you can imagine
it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I rambled on enough about
Skankfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go on all weekend talking about
the party, about the festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch Legion of Skanks podcast,
make sure you check out the recap episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're posting up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for all the footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a Legion of Skanks fan and
you are not at Skankfest this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hanging out with you
next year because I will definitely be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if we made friends at Skankfest this
year, bro, thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every person that I met and hung out with,
if it was a five minute interaction or all
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend long, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an amazing time at Skankfest with my
new friends and old friends that I found
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of old friends, you guys may have
seen the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did run into our friend Daz from Night
Owl and his lovely partner in crime,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those two beautiful folks for
hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did post a picture of myself and Daz
from Night Owl and it got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, all of the assumptions you made
from that photo are completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for Night Owl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics projects in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will be a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most I can say right now is that the
F1s have been made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the future, there will be some
stuff from Night Owl and I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that's all I've got to
talk about Skankfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk a little bit more about comedy
festivals because when I came back from
[SPEAKER_00]: Skankfest, I had tickets to see Burt
Kreischer, Big Jay Okerson, and Dan Soder
[SPEAKER_00]: at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an amazing show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was weird to think about comedians
playing at a 10,000 seat venue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but man, they got a party going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they bring DJ Sypha Sounds,
who's famous in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sypha Sounds gets the party going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He plays a bunch of great music.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played good music for the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of white people and music for
a bunch of white people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But DJ Sypha Sounds got us dancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Dan Soder came out, did about 10
minutes of amazing comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His set was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Jay Okerson came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell that Big Jay was still
fried from Skankfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both had Skankfest voice and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like we both needed a nap,
but it was well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after Big Jay crushed the stage
for a few minutes, Burt Kreischer came out
[SPEAKER_00]: and did an amazing set.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a full comedy show and then told
the machine story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the machine story, he interrupted
himself to tell other stories and other
[SPEAKER_00]: jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burt was lighting joints and passing them
to the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you can go see live
comedy, I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some of my favorite shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see you at Skankfest next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to any upcoming comedy
shows, message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can smoke out front.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at any shows in Colorado,
it's probably the Paramount Theater or
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll get to catch up and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered all of the stuff
about Skankfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw Burt Kreischer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it says here, I got sick, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not do any crazy drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do anything weird in Las Vegas,
but I came back sick as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a major sinus infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a chest congestion problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I do sound a little shitty here on
the podcast, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear into my nose just a little bit,
but I'm not going to let that slow me
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me several days to get my shit
back in action here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be a short podcast,
not a lot of details, and we're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk too much about a highly detailed
growing because my voice may not be well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't want to waste a good show with
a crappy voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough about Skankfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout outs to everybody that I hung out
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a comedian, if it was a
civilian, an old friend, a new friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz from Mephisto, Matty from Mephisto,
all the crew from ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I showed up, so I got off the plane,
I went to my hotel, dropped off my bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: put on some clean clothes, and then I
thought, I'm going to go out to Fremont
[SPEAKER_00]: Street and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was on Fremont Street for 20 minutes
walking and I heard several dudes yell,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross did Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, this is weird
because I'm not in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Denver, that would be normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Las Vegas and people are
screaming my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked back and it's the crew from
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my boys from
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all there waiting to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of buddied up with them and
partnered up with those guys for Thursday
[SPEAKER_00]: evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made it a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all the friends at
Skankfest, new friends, old friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that remember me and friends that
have no idea they met me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Skankfest is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people there that are sober and
there are people there that are the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite and everything in between good
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enough talking about Skankfest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more thing I want to cover
before we talk about winter adjustments in
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this podcast, I have been giving away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website on the top,
there's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those says grow help or questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that tab, you were given
the opportunity to ask me a grow question,
[SPEAKER_00]: something about your garden, something
about your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something about consumption or
cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, that means that you will win a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of iregenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, I do feel like I have sent
prizes to everybody who has won seeds on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast, but I am not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make mistakes, shit slips through the
cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have sent me a message and I read
your grow question here on the podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel like I owe you a pack of seeds
and you have not gotten them, please send
[SPEAKER_00]: me a reminder email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the word prizes and the subject line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, hey, Rasta Jeff, you owe me seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what episode I read your
message in and then send me a real name
[SPEAKER_00]: and a shipping address.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you send me a shipping address,
please send me a real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to send seeds to
bongsmoker5000 I don't like sending seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: to ganjafarmer420, stonerdave56.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to avoid all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put a real name on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USPS is getting curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want any of those packages to get
opened because there's a weird name on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's help each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your mailman knows your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're delivering mail to your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Smith, Bob Smith every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get one package that says
ganjabob5000.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know there's something weird in that
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just put a real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a real safe address on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do look forward to getting your
prizes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've gotten prizes, now is the time
to start posting those photos of the
[SPEAKER_00]: progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing any iry genetic strains,
I would appreciate it if you join us on
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the discord server, there's a tab
for every strain that I have put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the strains are on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are under the new and
unreleased tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you scroll through the tabs,
there's a blueberry butcher, big mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: fudge cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes alphabetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go down and go alphabetically,
almost every strain is listed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at the current photos and
grow reports that are up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly encourage you to post your
grow progress in those tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does a lot of things for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then new growers that want to grow that
strain, they can go there and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with people growing that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can say, hey, I'm growing big
mountain fudge cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the discord and look and they
can see all the previous grows that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can talk about which phenotypes they
got, how long they took, what anomalies
[SPEAKER_00]: they saw, if the plant needed any extra
feeding or attention, that should all be
[SPEAKER_00]: right there in the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invite you and encourage you to come
join us on the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, people who post impressive photos on
the discord end up with free seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more impressive photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us on the discord, post those grow
report photos, and maybe just maybe I will
[SPEAKER_00]: send you more free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's talk about the
important part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about adjusting our grow room
from the summer conditions to the upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: winter conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past three months, it has been 90
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next week, it is going to shift
from 90 degrees to about 65 degree days
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I need to make adjustments in
my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I going to compensate for the drop
in temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to remove my air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the air conditioner in that
grow space right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is already cold enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air conditioner is coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: To replace that air conditioner,
I'm going to hang up a 1000 watt high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium lamp and that is going to
keep my grow space warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, bro, you're a
dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's old technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in Colorado last year,
we got about negative 15 negative 17
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees and that is freaking cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that HPS lamp in my room will help
keep the room warm when it gets that cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's adding more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put a heater in there,
but all the heater is going to do is make
[SPEAKER_00]: more heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put a light in there, use the light
to generate heat, use the heat to heat the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm getting more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took out the air conditioner and I've
added one big light to create some heat in
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't get warm enough,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add another light in there because a
heater in my opinion is a great idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's just heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get two things out of making
heat, why not make light increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the plants want anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use those grow lights to
keep the grow room warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I did was I took out the
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that dehumidifier right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super hot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting super high humid
conditions in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, since it is cold and dry outside,
I am now adding a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have swapped my cold source for a
heat source and now I have swapped my dehu
[SPEAKER_00]: for a hue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the big major shifts that I have
done in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know how you have your ducting
set up, but if you are in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, in the right place,
maybe you can turn your ducting around and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in some of that cool air and cool
that hot room if you've got a hot room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just a couple of basic ideas
that I think about when winter starts
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn off that air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang up another light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of the dehumidifier and add
a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your grow room and I don't
know your situation, but let's think about
[SPEAKER_00]: ways we can optimize that grow room for
the seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is are your
plants on the floor in your grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That floor, if you've got a grow room in a
basement, if you've got a grow room in a
[SPEAKER_00]: garage, a room that's not insulated,
how cold is that floor getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take off your shoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And socks and stand on that floor
comfortably?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't, the plants cannot either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like having their feet or their
balls sitting on a cold floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to add water to that
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got cold, wet feet and balls on a
cold floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are not going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice is to lift those plants up off
the ground some way, either build a little
[SPEAKER_00]: table, build a tray, or if you've just got
a few plants, a very easy method is to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: more pots of the same size and flip them
upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a three gallon pot,
get another three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it upside down and put your plant
right on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your plant is up off of the ground and
actually a little bit closer to the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: which may be a good thing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about those plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to get real cold when you
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to consider is how cold is
the water that you are feeding these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: My water pipes run along the outside of my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it's cold outside, the water
coming out is naturally freaking cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run that water, fill up my
containers, whether it's a trash can,
[SPEAKER_00]: some buckets or a reservoir or whatever
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that up and then I put it in the grow
room under the grow lights for several
[SPEAKER_00]: hours to warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when I water it, that water is
not super cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend feeding water colder
than 69 or 70 degrees to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will have detrimental effects to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's think about the ways that we can
utilize and optimize our grow room for
[SPEAKER_00]: this seasonal change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we can think about is what
are you doing with the heat from your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grow space is warm enough and you
need to get rid of some of that heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you ducting that heat into a living
space within the house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send the heat right out the house
outside, out the attic, outside through a
[SPEAKER_00]: window or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can utilize that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if the light generated the heat,
if the heater generated the heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're paying for it via electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put that heat into the house
somewhere, shoot it into a bedroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot it into the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you got to do, let's warm
up some part of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're growing mushrooms in another
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot that heat into the mushroom room or
maybe shoot that excess heat into your veg
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not shoot heat out of the house
while it's fucking cold in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to keep in mind is when are
you running these lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, my flower room comes on at
nighttime because I don't want to compete
[SPEAKER_00]: with the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's easier to keep my grow room
cool at night because the sun's not up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the grow lights and the sun
creating heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the sun goes down, that's when my
grow room comes on in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to switch those hours in the
winter so that the lights are on during
[SPEAKER_00]: the day and then you get that cold at
night so you can get an extra cold in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to utilize the change in
the seasons to make your grow room ideal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, excuse me for clearing my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even going to edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep moving because I'm on
a flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is daylight
savings time is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we're even still going to
do that in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spring forward and you fall back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just about time to fall back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to set your timers on
daylight savings time now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you plan to wait until daylight
savings time comes and then adjust your
[SPEAKER_00]: timers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you just going to forget about
daylight savings time altogether in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and let it ride and just be whatever
time it is in there and let that rock?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something to think about now
because all of these things are
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seasons are going to change quickly,
especially here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The further east you go, the more quickly
things are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends on the East Coast that
are already talking about it's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's chopping down their outdoor
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's something else we should talk
about really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you chopped down your outdoor plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out there and get those going because
it's going to get cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get frosty and your outdoor
plants are going to be screwed very soon
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you've got some sort of warmth or
shelter for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think that covers
the seasonal switch that I wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to talk about Skank Fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to talk about switching our rooms
for the grow season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.
