[SPEAKER_00]: it super easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you guys thank you for all of the
continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with talking about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Keith at Black
Sale Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have switched my own personal breeding
area to all complete LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now running all complete Canon LEDs in
all my personal grow spaces and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look mostly happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all grower air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look mostly happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing a lot of robust growth in most
areas of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electricity bill has gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of cooling I need, the amount
of ducting and ventilation I need has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am impressed and ecstatic with my new
LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Canon LEDs from Black Sale Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Black Sale
Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out and use coupon code
RASTAJEFF.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you out just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith did not pay me for that ad or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving him a shout out because I
do love the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look great in most areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me do a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an error in one part of my grow
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the plants get a little bit too
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a little bit too close to that
LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to yellow up just a
little bit, but it is a learning
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew exactly what was causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants just looked yellow and I was
like, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought about it and I looked
around and I said, they're just too close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only variable in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we are learning to work with new
lights, we may want to keep them a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have done to fix that is just
turned down the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are 315 or 325 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start, I simply cranked them down
to 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're greening back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I topped them just to get that main top
out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the lights down, hit them with a
little foliar foliar feed of base
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a little push in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody looks happy, but there was a
little bit of a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things to talk about
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the LED lights, but if you're going
to use them, make sure they are the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate distance away from your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't be afraid to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I made a mistake and my plants
are kind of yellowed out and I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: recover from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have to learn that once we're past
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen a lot of people on social
media having a heartbreak over discovering
[SPEAKER_00]: that their gigantic plants are now males.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put these big ass plants into males
and they are heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep seeing this on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about this in outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was kind of looked over and I
realized that people don't really go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people are not listening to that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's kind of talk about, uh,
sexing our cannabis plants that way when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing these big giant plants,
uh, you don't discover later on after
[SPEAKER_00]: spending time, uh, money, energy,
nutrients, uh, whatever you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't waste all this time,
money, energy, nutrients, space,
[SPEAKER_00]: space is expensive on growing a male
plant, a responsible farmer, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: tests for sex before investing all of this
time, space, energy, and money into a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that we're going to have to chop
down and throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, that can be really
heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you just spent all of your
money on new seeds, on new equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you find out that that plant is a
male and you've grown it way too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how to quickly and
responsibly find out if we are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: male or female plants before we get them
into the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you spend a month vegging that
you've watered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you water it three times a week,
you probably watered 12 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spent time phing the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a light running for a month,
maybe two months at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's going to cost you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soil cost you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just having that space wasted technically
is costing you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that grow space is not producing,
it is an expense at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could find out if our plants are
males or females much more quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to touch on that I did
not write on my notes here is the quickest
[SPEAKER_00]: way to sex them is a sex test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have science now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can easily, uh, order these little
cards from a testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rub a leaf onto the testing card.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need is some of the juice from the
plant to transfer onto the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fold the card back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mark that plant, plant number 9,653.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mark the card 9,653 and you mail that
card into the testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you if that plant is a male
or a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the quickest, most efficient way
to identify male and female plants in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if the plant is male and you're
not looking to breed, then you can get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of it at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got female plants to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've bought yourself more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to waste time watering
that male plant that you didn't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to up pot that thing into
a bigger plant because this should happen
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're in tiny pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either, uh, people say that cups are for
beer, but I know a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guilty of it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think beer cups are a great place for
the little clones, little starter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in a commercial facility,
I use four and six inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So little plants, get them real tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do the sex test on the card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just rub, pull off a leaf, rub it on
there, send it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will let you know in just a couple of
weeks, depending on how busy the lab is,
[SPEAKER_00]: how far away the lab is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll let you know very quickly if
you've got male or female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the quickest way to determine if
you've got male or female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cost you a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you've only got small space
and you're trying to go quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that little bit of money is worth
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to spend that money on
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People allocate their money for different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the funds, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've only got one room and you
were trying to find the sex of your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can you do that without disrupting
your grow too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one room, one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sprout some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be in, they would really be
very tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be in six inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said that before, no bigger than a
one gallon pot at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I don't want to waste a lot
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste a lot of light and
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to be wasteful here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to pot like a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just say, we'll do a 10 pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm allowed to have 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 10 pack keeps me safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pop 10 seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to veg them out until they are
six or eight ish inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at that point, I'm going to put them
into 12, 12 lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put them into flower,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to let them grow for maybe a
week, maybe two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to put them into flower in
about seven, 10, maybe 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will definitely have shown me
if they are males or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at that point, like I said earlier,
if I'm not breeding, I'm going to chop
[SPEAKER_00]: down all the male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get those out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take those little tiny six
inch net pots and I'm going to throw that
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt away or recycle that dirt,
whatever I choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've only wasted a couple of six inch
net pots worth of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only wasted two, maybe three or four
or five weeks worth of growth of light
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, airspace, airtime, real estate
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't wasted a whole bunch of time and
we didn't need two rooms to determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: sex of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to grow them until they are
big enough that we think they can,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that's ready to flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two weeks is good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them six, eight, 10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then flip them, put them on 12,
12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they have showed you their sex,
we are going to put them back on an 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: six light cycle, 18 on six hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you really want to, you can put them
on a 24 hour on and zero off light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will go back into a vegetative
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't let them flower too long,
if you're good at identifying the sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as you see that sex, that sex
part, that male part, that female part,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is when you put them back into the
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a really quick way to determine
sex of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got one room, if you have
got two separate areas, here is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal way or another really ideal way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way that I myself personally
sex my plants in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may pay for the lab testing to have
those sent in just because, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that saves us a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The week that it takes us to send and get
that test back is well worth the two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: that it takes us to find out if they're
males or females in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just do the little, the rub test,
send them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very quick, but here's how I do it
in my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a clone and a flower or
possibly two or three separate areas
[SPEAKER_00]: available, this is how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get them into that six inch net
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as soon as they're big enough,
maybe a one gallon pot, as soon as they
[SPEAKER_00]: are big enough to get one, maybe three
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how good at cloning you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a really good cloner,
take three clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not good at it, one clone should
be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really good at it,
I'm not sure what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking, I don't have much notes here,
so this is all freestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you are super good at cloning,
take one clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not super good at it,
take three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you've got a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that plant starts to grow,
the main top will shoot out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your first clone to take right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a clone of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it grow a little bit more and get the
two very bottom branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as not the little shitty branches
on the bottom, but the two main branches
[SPEAKER_00]: that are big enough to take a clone off
of, clone those off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got three clones in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've also got the original donor
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to call that the donor plant
at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the same genetic it's all
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the mother plant, the donor
plant, and three clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the clone dome under a 12,
12 light, and those plants will show you
[SPEAKER_00]: sex in seven, 10, 12, maybe 14 days at the
very latest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got little tiny clones in a clone
dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start showing you sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can say, you got to label your
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got plant A, plant B, plant C.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to label your clones A,
B, and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if clone A shows you that it's female,
plant A is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: If clone B shows you that it's a male,
you got to get rid of that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you're breeding, plan on
chucking some pollen, making some seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of plant number B also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a quick way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put that tray of clones directly
under 12, 12 lighting, and it will let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what is a male and female in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another option, you can let those
clones root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them develop roots, pot them into some
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go right into beer cups or
your six inch net pots or four inch square
[SPEAKER_00]: pots or one gallon pots, however you want
to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do it, pot those bad dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this time, your other plants are
getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've still got that donor plant,
the mother plant, hanging out in the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've still got that bad bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need to be up potted to a three or
five gallon pot by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving you a couple of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to clean up the bottom of it
by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got these bigger plants and
you've got clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let the clones root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got two options at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put those clones into dirt and put
them under 12, 12 and have a small crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can let them veg a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them under 12, 12 and have a small
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're sure they're all going to
live, you've got one of plant A,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of plant B, one of plant C,
one of all of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did a 10 pack of seeds,
you got all 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a clone of all 10 in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got all 10 of these big plants over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can decide to move those
bigger plants into the flower room and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep those clones back as your mother
plants or your genetic preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you want to call it,
that's your your new nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will become your new mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really like to have that plant
that came from seed as their keeper mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that original plant that
sprouted from the seed as their keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people don't mind keeping a clone of
it as the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a problem either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I do it, I'll tell you how I
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that top in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I see roots on that bad bitch,
I move the other plants into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take them about 12 to 14
days to kick into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take about the same amount of time
for my clones over here to make roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they're in flower,
they're kicking out flowers, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are ready to go into their
beer cups or six-inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've got a copy of everything that I
just moved into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a fresh copy of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know what the males and females are
because in a few days, these big plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: about 12, 14 days, these big plants are
going to show me what are males and
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll chop down those bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as big as some people will let
them go by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'll chop down those big plants,
crowd all the others together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll get rid of those cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the bigger ones into the flower room
because they're already bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already ready already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I going to wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't insist on having that rooted seed
plant as the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone will go into the mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut clones from it, and then guess
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into the flower room, just
generation after generation of cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: clones into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sexting, the way that I do it,
let me recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pot my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they're big enough to get a
clone, I get a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that pot, that plant now goes into a
three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably got 10 of them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I move all 10 of those into the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my thing, my cloner filled with 10
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: These start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These start to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will know in about 10 to 14 days if
these are males or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull the males and I'll pull the
corresponding clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are in flower and I've got more
plants that are working as mother slash
[SPEAKER_00]: veg plants to keep my cycles going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already in flower with one batch and
I've already set up for veg and mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for the next batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way that I do sexting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went really quickly and I didn't look at
the notes very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the clone, run the big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deciding which one you want to run and
what to keep is your strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just told you which one I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the big one into flower because it's
already ready already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been vegging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've been taking care of it
for the whole time that the other clones
[SPEAKER_00]: have been rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way that if you are waiting
for those clones to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not really good at cloning,
if you're not super successful with your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, maybe wait until these clones make
roots before you move these other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it too early, you can take
clones from plants that are early into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, but I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes some things go wonky,
but just wait, just hold off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't move these into flower until these
have roots is a good part of the strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that big plant is already vegged out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally I will move that into the
flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do prefer, like I said,
to keep that original seeded plant as the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't find it necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your clone cutting technique
and clone care is good, you'll still have
[SPEAKER_00]: those solid genetics forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to move that original seed
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your clones, put that clone into a
pot, a pot that cut clones from that,
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get a nice perpetual grow
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a look at the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I sex my plants early.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for doing this, like I said
earlier, so you don't end up with a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have scrogged out and done a
bunch of work to it for weeks and weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and weeks, and then you find out that
you've got a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a scrog, you've got a scrog
net all filled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cut out that one plant out of
that net, you got a whole bunch of empty
[SPEAKER_00]: wasted space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have just found out if you had
males or females, maybe it does slow you
[SPEAKER_00]: down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is an extra step, but these extra
steps are what set us up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do these extra steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, I say this a lot when I talk
about phenohunting and sexing,
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't the last run with these
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the very first run we are learning
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, hopefully this is not your last
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just learning here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to run these plants
again and again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you run them, the more you're
going to get more comfortable with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do all day?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your hobby?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's something that, to some people,
what is something you do that would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably scare the shit out of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown cannabis for, let's not even
talk about how many years I've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been playing the drums since I
was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to turn 42 years old,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got drums for my 14th birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do the math there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I could be really comfortable
at, if we were at a club and a rock and
[SPEAKER_00]: roll band said, hey, our drummer just
cannot play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to kill the drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, I said, our drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, my mouth won't even let me say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, I was going to say,
our drummer just died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, we need a drummer
that can play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put my hands up and go,
you got sticks, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there sticks in a drum set?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fill in for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will just completely shit
their pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not comfortable walking up on
stage and going, I'll do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What songs are we going to play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of hum the song at me and we'll play
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have no problem doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm fine with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people I say, go get up on
that stage and play the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just start shitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get shaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where I shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will be that way in the grow room
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow a few crops, read a lot about your
plants, kill a few plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to fuck up a few
plants to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know their limits?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know what they can and cannot
take if you don't push a few of them to
[SPEAKER_00]: their limits?
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll get as comfortable as I am
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'm so comfortable is because
I've been doing it every single day for
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than I should admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about earlier on a podcast with
Mike on the previous episode, we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing on a commercial level in
2007 and 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many plants, crops,
run cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long I've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm so comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting the grow, learn, read,
pay attention, take notes, be passionate,
[SPEAKER_00]: be mindful and have purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you're doing in that garden have
purpose for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it because don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Rasta Jeff said, so don't do it
because somebody else on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: said, so don't do it because your
brother's uncle's cousin did it and got
[SPEAKER_00]: good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful, be thoughtful, have a
strategy, know why and what you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and think about whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today in the garden isn't going to,
you'll see it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get in there and do some silly
shit, you may see it today, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to see results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the results in three,
five, seven, 10, 14, 21, 30 days from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what it's going to do to the
top and bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will it affect the overall performance
of the entire crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just this one plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it good for the whole fucking grow
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a lot of forethought, have some
strategically when you're in there playing
[SPEAKER_00]: around in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you top the plants, you're going to
see that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drop a light on it and crush a
plant, you'll see that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fully your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not notice that until the lights
come on tomorrow or the next light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overfed some weird nutrient,
if you didn't pH properly, that's slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: going to progress over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we take a lot of notes and pay
a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about all of the shit you do to
your plants today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not notice any outcome for two to
three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to do several things to
the plants, maybe space those out by a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you know what is working and what
is not working, have some sort of control,
[SPEAKER_00]: have some standard operating procedures,
some sort of strategy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I want to talk
about before we start wrapping up this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get quite chatty today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this question is, uh, can I keep a fem
seed as a mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quick answer to that is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that on the internet a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are talking about feminized seeds
being inferior to regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about they are prone to
hermaphroditism, that you can't keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: as a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, why couldn't you keep a
feminized seed as a mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows just like a regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that plant not containing,
that seed never hit, that seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: that female plant never got any male
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no male chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that male chromosome,
there's no difference than any other seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my great crosses are made from
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep a mother plant of a fem
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next question is, can you breed
with a feminized mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew, the grateful dog was a
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grateful dog gets pollinated by an
arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that come from that are morning
dew, regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grateful dog plant is kept as a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to keep it perpetually if I want
to cross to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few things that I cross to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do keep a mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a feminized seed and I keep a mother
of it constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one that is always in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been there since the, we're not even
going to say how long that's been around,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 2008-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's been in the garden 2008,
2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's been around for quite a while,
that exact version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can keep a feminized seed as a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is no different than all of your other
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is it was a feminized
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it grows, it is the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was done correctly, it works just
like any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part of that question was,
can I breed to that feminized mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning dew comes from a feminized female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon sunrise comes, lemon Jeffrey is
feminized seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeff is only available in fem seeds
because the goal and goal is only a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no male, so I've got to reverse
it to make the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lemon Jeffrey is only available in fem
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have noticed that I make lemon
sunrise regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the arise to the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a breeding project of a
feminized plant that is pollinated by a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular male and it just makes regular
male female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to wrap that up, you absolutely can
keep a female, a feminized plant as a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother and you can absolutely breed and
outbreed to feminized plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think that was
about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for hanging out
with me.
