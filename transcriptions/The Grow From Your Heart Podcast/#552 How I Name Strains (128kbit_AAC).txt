[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dad's of headbanger live
batter from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of sour diesel IBL and
biker Kush on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as sour and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show that to the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful glob of beautiful bright
yellow, shiny, tasty, delicious batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like some cheesecake or maybe a
big chunk of thick butter there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice four gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably dabbed about a gram and a half
out of that so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the headbanger live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously got me nice and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buzz is perfect for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at green
dot labs for the delicious headbanger live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode, I'm going to
talk a little bit about how I choose
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, let's do some

[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I did include a link in the show
notes to make it nice and easy for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: my working and stone friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I feel like I got through that
part of the show without too many stumbles
[SPEAKER_00]: and too many rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if you're watching the video,
you have noticed I've got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a different setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got different earbuds in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lapel mic or a lav mic if you
will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experimenting with a little bit of a
different setup trying to get this mic
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be a grow intensive
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not going to be a lot of lessons
and details.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was experimenting with new equipment so
that if anything doesn't sound perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not an episode that is super
critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed any real detailed lessons or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is kind of a jump into my brain,
kind of an idea of what I do and why my
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas are the way they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing super critical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, what else are we
going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep you guys updated on what is
happening in my personal gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following the show,
you know that I've been breeding with Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a big fan of Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say I learned a lot of what to
do and what not to do from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me a lot about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me a lot about this business.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was way ahead of me in this game,
so I learned quite a bit from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt it was my responsibility to breed
with his Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a Jack the Ripper male that is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes beautiful flower clusters,
made a little bit of purple laden flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: giant big top coles, nice branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like trash can and puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male Jack the Ripper has been putting
in work in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pollinated several select females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have trickled out a few of the names of
the ladies that have been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just real quickly, I will say that I did
of course pollinate and arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be Jack the Ripper to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's arise to Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always when you're writing down genetics,
always list ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like most things in life,
ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listing genetics, the female
plant, X, the male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be arise cross to Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be golden goat to Jack the
Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a blueberry cookies female in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be blueberry cookies to Jack
the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have also put a golden goat in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I already say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have revealed that on a previous
episode, but there is a golden goat in
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have been very successfully
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That room is loaded up with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to say that the seeds are growing
very quickly underneath the Canon LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy and impressed and excited
with the way the Canons are working for
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are getting big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to harden up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I predict I've got somewhere between 14
and 21 days before these seeds are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can chop them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I let the plants get bone dry,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I take the seeds out, the plants
will be dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hang for 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll buck the buds into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I mush the buds up real small into
dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I run that dust through a seed
sorting machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulls all the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts all the dust in another pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I will test the seeds
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will germinate some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will grow some of them and see if I am
satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I have determined that I am or am not
satisfied with what these seeds do,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I will consider releasing them to
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are already typing me an
email asking how they can be a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the time comes, I'll make it known
and I'll let you know how to be a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the seeds are tested by myself and
tested by my qualified testers,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we will consider if they pass
testing, do they go to the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they be released to the general
public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if they are released,
I will let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hide things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like things to be known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I want them to get out to the
market, get to the people and get sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: When and if they do make it to the market,
I promise you that you will know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what has happened in my growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has pollinated several select females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I did put a Jack the Ripper
female in there so we can make some Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of great shit
coming out of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep the updates coming and I'll
certainly let you know how testing is
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I like recording without that
microphone in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have smacked it three times by now
and I haven't touched it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get used to this as long as this
sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're a couple of minutes into the
show here, you've been listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it still sound good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is very important to me that
you approve of the sound quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fix sound quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The content is going to be similar all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound quality, we can improve or
adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you love it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you hate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com or
send me a tweet on Twitter at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how you feel about this mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a bunch of negative feedback,
I'll learn how to use this mic better or
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll honestly switch back to the old mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to make the show sound good,
doing it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the portion of the show where I'm
going to talk about how I come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow me, you know that I like to
put out strains with very creative,
[SPEAKER_00]: unique and fun names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out some strains that I think,
I hate to say it, I think that names can
[SPEAKER_00]: make or break a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like naming a band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if Metallica and you're going to
have your own opinion of Metallica,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can argue with me or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're one of the best selling fucking
bands on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love them or hate them,
you cannot argue that they have made more
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking money than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metallica, if they would have named
themselves like fucking special blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would have never did what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Metallica, the name stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a good logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the name really helped it sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, naming cannabis strains can
really make or break a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things I've given weird names and
they were killer strains and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes I've made amazing crosses
and they just don't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they don't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me adjust this mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just flipped itself over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the strains just don't sell and
it's probably based on the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you heard that
unprofessionalism in the microphone
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, but we're going to stay on track
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A strain name can make or break a strain
is something that I've learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I still try to stick with shit that I
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names that really ring in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of putting my personality into
my company, my breeding, my work,
[SPEAKER_00]: my project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected those parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them on a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hooked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the name should come from me also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should come from my heart, just like my
grow did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling, trying to build up hype a
little bit here, but let's talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are things that come to my mind and
what are things I think of when I'm making
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a cross of Golden Goat and
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker came from Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage Green Genetics had a theme of using
one word inspirational type words to name
[SPEAKER_00]: their strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to continue that tradition and
honor Gage Green Genetics by giving Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: a one word name that felt uplifting and
positive and a powerful word.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you read the word Arise, I think of
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fucking Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get off my chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get off the couch and I'm
going to rise up and be the best I can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: or there's some sort of uprising or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really felt that it was a powerful word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you consume Arise, some people
really want to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really want to get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I did notice, it makes people who
hurt, it makes your body pains go away and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get up and you feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not come up with the name Arise on
my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to admit that I was asking for
strain names on social media for a totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody said, I like Arise as a
strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that is not the name of this
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name of another one I'm working
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew, I was like, that's Golden Goat
and Daybreaker going to be called Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was put on a list by somebody else
and I matched it up to the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise was called Arise because I liked the
way that one word, one syllable,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that's two, Arise, just a short
word, a few short letters, just real
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful and invoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Arise became Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to kind of keep with the Gage
Green tradition of those types of words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also really liked the,
just the feeling of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that became Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Prana was also a cross of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow and Prana make Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or no, flow and Arise, sorry, make Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking too many thoughts at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow is the female, Arise is the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was Googling words that you would find
in a yoga class or kind of where that came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow, like the flow, the movement of
energy and the upward flow of energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise and the word that came out of all my
Google searching and talking to girls who
[SPEAKER_00]: do yoga.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some research there, some recon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up with the word Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where my brain was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stuck with that one word, short
syllable, powerful feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I obviously like to name stuff after
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a huge Grateful Dead fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a Deadhead since high school,
since probably 14 or 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Grateful Dead, all the stuff
that Dead does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll notice a lot of my strains have
Grateful Dead names or hints or nods to
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dead songs within the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, Dark Hollow is a strain I did
an episode on last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is straight up a Grateful Dead song.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my favorite Grateful Dead
songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fit the strain very well because it
makes big dark leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Hollow, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scarlet Bagonias, that is a Grateful Dead
song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm sure you guys heard that other
band do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead fucking put that one
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Grateful Dead song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta name Scarlet Bagonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scarlet Bagonias, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has Red-Headed Stranger in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red-Headed Stranger, Cross to the Arise,
The Red, Grateful Dead Influence,
[SPEAKER_00]: Scarlet Bagonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really easy that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew is a Grateful Dead song,
Walk Me Out in the Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Grateful Dead lyric that's very
well known amongst Deadheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew is a cross of Grateful Dog and
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog, that is a Grateful Dead side
project that was written by Jerry Garcia
[SPEAKER_00]: and David Grissman's Bluegrass project was
Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog, Cross to the Arise became
Morning Dew, which is another Grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead song.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are seeing my Grateful Dead
influence come out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the Grateful Dead names
that I have used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggae artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Bounty Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Capelton.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else was there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bounty Killer was called Bounty Killer
because it put off Giant Harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bounty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It killed The Bounty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Bounty Killer is a reggae artist,
a Jamaican dance hall reggae artist that
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite aggressive, pretty fucking
awesome, love that vibe, good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where Bounty Killer came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capelton was a Grateful Dog to White Widow
Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capelton is a reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalanji is Kalanji Kush is named after
Sisla Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Tahoe OG to the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the Grateful Dog and pollinated a
few select females and they got named
[SPEAKER_00]: after reggae stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's where I took it even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the Capelton and I pollinated the
Capelton with King Solomon, my Arise male,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I called that Sunshine Girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Capelton sings a song called
Sunshine Girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It couldn't get any better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's my sunshine girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Kalanji Kush crossed to the Arise
became Liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons I chose the
word liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you hear Capelton and Kalanji
just yell the words liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Morgan Heritage, one of my favorite
reggae bands has a song called Liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liberation was on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word came up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also fits with that one word theme thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liberation OG came up right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggae themes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have in the reggae themes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pineapple wine, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pineapple wine is straight up a Morgan
Heritage song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pineapple wine is cactus cooler crossed to
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow it, it has tropical flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a fermented funky sort of a
flavor on the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the wine part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tropical fruit flavor is the
pineapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my, my pineapple wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up the Morgan Heritage song,
think of pineapple wine, smoke some good
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs, some ganja, and you're going to
say, that guy nailed that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where some of those strain names
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise, I told you about Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liberation OG is Kalanji to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was just talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost place on my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got things like blue raspberry
truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I name blue raspberry truffle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds very unique and creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a color.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say colors, colors already start
your brain working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like blue raspberry and truffles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truffles are exotic and different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does all this nonsense in my name
scheme come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's blueberry cookies in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like blueberry cookies,
blueberry muffins, but also raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: because when I was younger, they used to
sell these blue, purple, blue lollipops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd suck on them and your whole fucking
face would turn blue and purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the outside, the inside of your mouth
would turn blue and purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lips and tongue would be completely
purple and blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds taste like these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipops, the blue raspberry lollipops,
but also since there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: ChemDog and Joseph OG in there,
there's an earthy, dirty, chocolatey taste
[SPEAKER_00]: on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels and sounds so good together.
[SPEAKER_00]: BRT, the blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just nice and simple, also kind of
creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a list of my strain names here in
my phone that I'm going to go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: just give you some ideas of how I came up
with some of these names before we move
[SPEAKER_00]: too far into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue raspberry truffle, I already told
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Dew, Scarlett Begonia's and Dark
Hollow, we're all grateful dead names.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cream is cookies and cream number 13
crossed to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cream always rises to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wrong with that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cream always rises to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies and cream to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one pays tribute to the original name
of Dosey Dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Dose is Dosey Dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossed to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: A double dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to a grateful dead show or if
you go to a show and somebody asks if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want some acid, I want a double dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that one came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently told that there's another
strain maker using the word double dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I googled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No beef, no hatred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of us has got to change our name or
something, but double dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom and Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is leading more into my childhood,
more about what I'm into as a youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have said Sonic Boom and Dragon
Punch, but I skipped one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom and Dragon Punch are both
Street Fighter 2 references.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom comes from Guile from Street
Fighter 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold backwards for two seconds,
press forward in any punch button,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Guile will throw Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fun game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pick Guile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll beat anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's play some Street Fighter 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where Sonic Boom came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Guile's fucking special move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragon Punch is Ken and Ryu's special move
from Street Fighter 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: He throws a fucking punch with fire on it,
goes up into the air and yells,
[SPEAKER_00]: Shotayuken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom and Dragon Punch, dude,
paying tribute to my favorite video game
[SPEAKER_00]: as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent so much time, so much time at
Lee's Market in Bellflower, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting schooled on Street Fighter 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the people that taught me
how to rage on that game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I already said it, Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a video game from the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember hanging out at Robbie Wilson's
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: His parents thought we were asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to put fucking towels under the
gap in the door so nobody could see the
[SPEAKER_00]: video game light reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would play Double Dragon until the sun
came up and then I was smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robbie's family was a church family and
they would go to church every Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stay the night on Saturday with
intentions to go to church, but it's weird
[SPEAKER_00]: because every Sunday I didn't feel good
and I had to go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up and had to take a mean shit and
didn't feel good at Robbie's house and had
[SPEAKER_00]: to go home right before church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never went to church with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hung out with them for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always pulled that scam beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody ever caught on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet they knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a dumbass kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Double Dragon, Sonic Boom,
Dragon Punch, paying homage to video games
[SPEAKER_00]: from my youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't I call that Strawberry
Starburst?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you bite into a strawberry
starburst, it tastes like you're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said that backwards, but that's
how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss, obviously, called Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it tastes like a fucking Sunkiss
orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give credit to Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Adam Ill named Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey, bro, I've got a cross called
Stardog to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, bro, it's called Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you smoke that shit,
you get starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just how that shit went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're running out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Storm Shadow, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow was a name of a strain that
I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Storm Shadow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow was a G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow was the silent killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storm Shadow was a ninja from G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe that wore all white.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loved him.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, he got a strain name named
after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really love to name a strain Snake
Eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's cooler than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they already got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to rip off a name on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where Storm Shadow came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is named after a G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to segue into another short
story about how I named some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to wrap up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next series of strains I want to talk
about, I've spoken about this on a podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but it fits beautifully in today's
episode, is my TMNT line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I avoid saying those words altogether,
but I have got some crosses that are
[SPEAKER_00]: called Donatello, Leonardo, Raphael,
Michelangelo, Bebop and Rocksteady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently I did release Shredder along
with that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are almost sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're gone, they will not be made
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about how those crosses got
their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a deep dive into the way that
my brain thinks and works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a room that I was pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to breed with the blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the blueberry cookies plant and I
reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to put that pollen on several
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had made a few selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose another blueberry cookies because
I wanted to make S1s of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my initial goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually asked to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that process, I put a strawberry
fields plant in the room, a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also put a platinum tangy female in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now my brain is thinking in colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain is different than a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see things differently than a lot of
people, which is glorious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the thing that's
developing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is strawberry fields in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is platinum tangy in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is blueberry cookies in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see those plants, when I write the
labels in my brain, I see the plant label
[SPEAKER_00]: in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why isn't that label blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my brain, it's fucking blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oranges, tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oranges in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other plants in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lemon skunk in there that doesn't
fit the theme, but it worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became Donatello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Durbin poison in there that became
Rocksteady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had an Arise in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became Bebop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, I added Golden Goat to the mix,
and that became Shredder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about how the name scheme
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working in a commercial cultivation
facility, and we had gotten a whole new
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery of fresh plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking of names of these strains
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like my meditation to keep myself
entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to call these new crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, we got new plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go and unload these and put these in
the computer system.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm unloading new plants, I came across
Lucinda Williams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm unloading the plants,
I also came across Maria Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just names of strains that
happened to come into my new facility or
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility I was in that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time this happened,
I'm thinking of new cross names for new
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking about cartoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, why don't you name them after
some cool cartoon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over there going spoon, thinking I'm
going to name it after the tick or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all kinds of weird ideas in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw Lucinda Williams, and I saw
Maria Cruz, my brain said, where is April
[SPEAKER_00]: O 'Neill?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it all came to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, oh, shit, April O'Neill,
you've got a red one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a blue one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an orange one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the fucking Ninja Turtles and
the three and the two bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Fields got the red label.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became Raphael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum Tangy with the orange label
became Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry Cookies with the blue label
became Leonardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that there wasn't a purple
plant in there, but Lemon Skunk is close
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be Donatello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Rocksteady was Durban Poison and
Bebop was The Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names happened within, once I saw,
once it clicked, it was done, set in
[SPEAKER_00]: stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came home that evening and I drew the
logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I redesigned the logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became the packaging for those
packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scribbled it on paper, took a picture of
it with my phone, sent that to my artist
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within five hours, we had all of the
designs dialed in, locked in, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were being printed out within that
fucking week and they were packaged up and
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit happened so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how they got their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about cartoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to name the strains after.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw Maria Cruz and Lucinda
Williams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, where's April O'Neill?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I said April O'Neill,
it spiraled into fucking the line that
[SPEAKER_00]: came out and is nearly sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how that line developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the name developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line developed because another friend
wanted the seeds of the blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives in another location.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't get him clones, but we can
definitely get him seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually got a few of all the crosses
just because I'm nice like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I continued with the line and did
what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then later on, I introduced Shredder into
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the Golden Goat in there and it all
worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all worked beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will not be made anymore,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few packs left.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few packs circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the vendors and on the
websites, but I will not make any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been looking for them,
now's your chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them while they're hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also use coupon code GFYH10 at
seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save yourself 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may cover shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying a few packs, that will
add up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the new microphone today,
so I'm not sure how much of that drink you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to hear, but I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrate yourselves, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to take good care of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

strains slash how I'm learning to use my
[SPEAKER_00]: lavalier mic episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I sounded great in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if I didn't sound marvelous,
