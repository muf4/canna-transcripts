[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I catch my breath from spitting out
that intro so loud and fast, would you
[SPEAKER_02]: like to tell everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to find me on social
media, you can follow me on Twitter at
[SPEAKER_00]: NemoPunk15 or you can find me on Facebook
at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: NemoPunk15, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: NemoPunk15 and Pueblo for Sensible
Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, I think I've asked you a long time
ago, and if this isn't appropriate for the
[SPEAKER_02]: show, we can't edit it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did NemoPunk15 come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell does that mean, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 15 is the age when I came up with
the handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was creating my first Hotmail account.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how old that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't necessarily want to say the
number of years that account has been
[SPEAKER_00]: around, but that was my first Hotmail
account way back in the day, and it has
[SPEAKER_00]: just survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first created a Twitter handle,
I did it as a joke so that I could hassle
[SPEAKER_00]: a Huffington Post live personality on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never thought it would go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we are, I don't know,
a decade later.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where NemoPunk15 comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's NemoPunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Nemo is known for Latin, and that
movie wasn't out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a little punk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you still.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a good dude now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an adult now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we would have known each other in
our teens, we would have gotten in a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more trouble than we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without being friends with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we met in our adult lives once we
got that shit out of our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's NemoPunk15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things that stuck
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every now and then I'm like,
I should retire that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's attached to everything at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my email addresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email is iregenetics at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came up with that one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed an email address.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit Hotmail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, and now when I tell
people, they're like, really, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you ever going to upgrade?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a Gmail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's not exactly an AOL address,
but it's close.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do check an AOL address occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my niece has ridiculed me
extensively for having a Hotmail account.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're telling people how old we are,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't want to reveal how many years
ago you made that email account.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're telling people we're handing it
to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, where's Genco's still, you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws is
in another good place to go support Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike posts great stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good friendly cannabis debates,
a lot of good cannabis info.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check him out at Pueblo for Sensible
Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you haven't been on a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people have been asking for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to plug your Patreon page
while I'm thinking about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me at probably a link in the show
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it easy for the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I'm editing and I hear that,
I'll go type that in the notes that I
[SPEAKER_02]: create.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put that in the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to some of my supporters real
quick because you gave me a chance to plug
[SPEAKER_00]: it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree Star Meadow, big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmer Z, always appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locomotive Medical, love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lima Priest, thank you so much for the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate the support,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to pay it forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit rolls downhill, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming on the show,
taking time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike might not be on the show as many
episodes as we would like him,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he does contribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll just message Mike a couple
things like, hey, bro, what's the answer
[SPEAKER_02]: to this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll just trigger my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there you go, Patreon funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some behind the scenes
action, but I've been missing being on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dragging my feet, getting the
new office space set up and getting all
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast equipment reassembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And episode 700 was the motivation I
needed to get her done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was like, 700 is coming up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, we're going to Zoom chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think we're going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the new background.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice and I like the dark setup there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just dark enough to where you're not
a floating head, but you are still
[SPEAKER_02]: mysterious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what's happening three feet
behind you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the kids needed my other light
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am shy one light source right now,
but everything else is up and running and
[SPEAKER_00]: still functional after like so much stuff
has happened since the last time I was on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was major construction in this
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to tear concrete out of the
jackhammer and install pumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say there was a flood,
everybody just goes, oh, like anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that's had a basement flood, they go,
oh, they feel empathetic or sympathetic or
[SPEAKER_02]: they get feelings and they understand
like, yeah, I know what you mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we understand that flood set you
back quite a bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like fighting four inches
of water come pouring out of your concrete
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fun night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said something about equipment and I
do want to reassure the people that this
[SPEAKER_02]: is the, uh, a rare zoom type video for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I do have the multi cam for
camera, a 4k camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were words in there that were meant
to make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multi camera, 4k camera setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really hard to say 4k cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I have that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a rare zoom occasion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using the, the Mac book camera here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty good in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but, uh, the other night, camera two,
I recorded a full show on it and camera
[SPEAKER_02]: two did not record.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm having both of those cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're, they're in timeout right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once they get fixed we'll be able
to do the episodes on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe just maybe there may be time,
uh, funding for an upgrade here because
[SPEAKER_02]: the Patreon folks have been helping us out
so much for so long that it may be time to
[SPEAKER_02]: add another camera, a better camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do assure you, I do promise this zoom
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, uh, one camera thing is not going to
be forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've set expectations and I will
deliver those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, speaking of that, that's a good
way to segue into this, uh, big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the Patreon crew,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the evolution of this podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next note is evolution of the show to
the evolution of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say we, uh, while you were
talking about getting the new cameras,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I was just over in the
new recording space and it is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting here at episode 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come a long way from that old coffee
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when you put your arms down,
you'd almost feel like you got letters
[SPEAKER_02]: imprinted on it because people had written
so many things that had just like
[SPEAKER_02]: hieroglyphics like melted into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of dabs stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of burn marks on that
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that table got a lot of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dabs stuck to the top of that table
were felony weight in some states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could probably scrape up enough,
uh, enough residual concentrates off that
[SPEAKER_02]: table to take a couple of fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The table did go through hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, big shout out to oil slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I was on a live show on an
Instagram live and oil slick came on and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, why don't you have a big
excuse that that's from the dabs before
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, why don't you have a big oil
slick?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, cause you didn't send it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, give me your PO box and check
that shit in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seriously, five days later,
there's a big table sized oil slick pad in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Covered the entire table is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So couldn't get, I just clean it real
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipe it down with a little alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't mess anything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went from a crappy recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used my old, uh, first episode with you
and Kevin is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to it like at least once a
year, just through my night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the show started when people tell
me that they're a new listener and they've
[SPEAKER_02]: gone back and they're like, I've listened
to the whole catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, thank you for the clicks and
thank you for liking the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also do don't don't don't judge me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm so much better at this by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure what we were doing yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know the, what the goal was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to have more of a hangout smoke
party vibe, but also I like teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of narrowed it down to me just
giving you a good lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's more, uh, more what I was
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I started using the old, that
equipment I used came from when I was a
[SPEAKER_02]: drummer on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an independent mixer for the drums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have a big mixing board,
all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had compression because Wade was blowing
out the mic on the old show we were on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had compression, uh, of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, uh, well then, uh, then we
upgraded to the zoom age six, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get four mics on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I remember times we had like nine
people on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were the whole table was full and
then the little side table over there had
[SPEAKER_02]: people at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, now I've got room for four mics on one
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using the dry dab that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the dry dab that day was sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to our buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shampoo sloppy, shampoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called him shampoo, but a shampoo
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, it was sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what were the numbers in his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the numbers sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always has numbers in his name,
but big up to slop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dizzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he took a big fat dry dab in a podcast
might've been episode 200 or 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the brain injury makes things
wonky, but I had a bunch of people over a
[SPEAKER_02]: garden of weed and crew was over spent
Maddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Joe buzzy was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sloppy was here and sloppy sat down and
took a fat dab out of a rig with no water
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a thousand experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email had slow baked all the water out
of the red cold glass rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass was warm enough to slowly bake
water out of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yummy dabs, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went from all that wonky recording
equipment to the zoom H six to now I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: using a zoom pod track four during the
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got inspired to, I don't remember what
number around five 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I started doing videos and I was
using the Mac book and just using the
[SPEAKER_02]: screen on the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was fun, but it didn't seem,
uh, as good as it could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew I could do better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just having this weird frame of
view was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a real camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I set up 4k camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I bought a, I learned how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned how to edit and final cut pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought a camera, which resulted in
buying a new computer because the camera,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I dumped that file into the computer
and the computer went, ah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did go buy a brand new computer that
could handle the editing and processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, if I'm going to
spend the money on that, let's fucking get
[SPEAKER_02]: another camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to cam and now I'm running
two Sony, uh, HD cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this mic going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I upgraded a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the, the giant camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the Joe Rogan mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't forget about the, I just call it
the Joe Rogan mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the sure SM seven B, uh, upgraded to
that multi cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have nearly sound guy at heart
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't shake that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sound guy part of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, that's always going to be in me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a sound guy ear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm not trained in sound guy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just done enough sound guy stuffed
where it's ingrained in me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious after the show, I want to know
what, what, what are you, what makes you
[SPEAKER_02]: think that what you see that or my sound
guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, right now for a hundred dollars,
I couldn't list a piece of equipment you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: named off other than because that bitch
failed on you like a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the old headphone app that I
wanted to throw through the wall several
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I'm trying to remember which
piece of equipment had the lights that
[SPEAKER_00]: would hypnotize me when I got too baked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably with the compressor
lights that would bounce and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: get real hypnotic when the show got
rambly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, yeah, then you would just get more
rambling and it would get more hypnotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, dude, we're close to 10,000 YouTube
subscribers, uh, for a little show that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, 10,000 subscribers, 700 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I thought maybe when we started
like a hundred episodes would be the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we hit a hundred, I was like,
two 50 would be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at two 50, I was like,
yeah, 500 seems like a cool goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at 500, something was like,
yeah, just do it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody knew it was on like
officially.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just going to be a steady every
Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could count on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe you haven't missed a
Monday in 700 episodes, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't missed a Monday on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think I've missed a Monday on
the Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I that's false because there was a
time period where my Instagram account was
[SPEAKER_02]: deactivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes they block me from
going live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sometimes they close my inbox where I
can read the messages, but I can't reply
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they like to toy with us a
little bit, but, uh, yeah, for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part for 700 episodes, like six years ish,
I have not missed a Monday and I do my
[SPEAKER_02]: best to put out a show every Thursday as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this actually comes out on a
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, thanks for noticing that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sometimes it's a struggle and
sometimes people are like, you want to go
[SPEAKER_02]: do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, ah, no, I got to record a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, do that tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's podcast day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole world might erupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your inbox would never recover if you
missed a Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that is the damn truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then the whole flow of everything
would just be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I feel like I'm working my way through
the notes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The evolution of the show has been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the only thing left to do is like
learn how to podcast better and then get
[SPEAKER_02]: more guests on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get, uh, more people on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to be on more shows, uh,
and maybe possibly some camera upgrades,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think everything else, bro,
the evolution is slowly happening pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am excited for the seven 10 show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hyping up the seven 10 and I
said seven 10 show earlier and Mike was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, seven 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not July, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the middle of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right after a big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He like exhaled and started talking about
being hyped for the seven 10 show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, poor guy dabbed himself
six months into the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, uh, number seven 10, not, not the date
of seven, the July show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you got to be prepared, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if I don't start planning ahead,
no, but episode number seven 10 is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I find it, uh, maybe it's odd that I'm
more excited about episode seven 10 than I
[SPEAKER_02]: was number 700 because seven 10 it's like,
uh, that's like the new four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a weed podcast, the proper release,
the proper celebration episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the milestone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have some friends from
discord, send us some great questions and
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a concentrate maker or two in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm going to try to do this type of a
setup with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so there will be another zoom,
uh, podcast coming up for seven 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will be worth it if I get who I'm
really trying to book onto the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash content is so rare and there's still
a lot of just confusion and non-exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to the modern hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the person I hope to have on,
I'm hoping that they can kind of teach us,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, how to take our garden from,
uh, from seed or clone all the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: smokable usable hash without breaking any
laws, without using any, uh, illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: solvents because they've made,
if you're making butane hash at home,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're technically breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's going to teach us, I'm hoping they
can teach us how to wash it, possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: press it, maybe find one person that
washes one person that presses,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the same guy will do both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe two guys that do both and let them
just give us a rundown of what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a bunch of good questions lined
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that discord server, uh,
my friends on discord have a lot of good
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have a good questions coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, patreon guys, if you're watching this
and gals, patreon supporters, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're watching this and you have good
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions for a
concentrate maker, go ahead and send them
[SPEAKER_02]: up on patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do my best to get those on the show
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that should be the gateway to getting
me more people on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hesitant, shy of, uh,
I'm not a good interviewer, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, everything's just hard right
now, travel and getting people around
[SPEAKER_00]: places and the video chats gotten
substantially better than it was four
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, uh, it's not the technology,
honestly, all excuses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, uh, I just, I'm not the best
interviewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could send me questions and I'll
have the list of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't figure out how to fucking
answer them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm better at just having a conversation,
but, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I just need to do that with the
interviewers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'll get good at it, but hopefully
this, uh, seven, 10 interview sparks my
[SPEAKER_02]: inspiration to get some more people on to
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys out there have guests in mind,
uh, or you'd like to be a guest,
[SPEAKER_02]: send me an email or a patreon email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me a request to be on the show or a
guest recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you send me a guest recommendation,
send me two or three questions to go along
[SPEAKER_02]: with that guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have something to ask them something
to get the conversation flowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are trying to be on the show,
tell me what we're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, tell me why you stand out,
why you are, uh, why you're qualified.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds maybe, uh, conceited or
something, but tell me why you're
[SPEAKER_02]: qualified to teach my audience your
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would it put you on the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't just let you come out here in your
underwear and talk about crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to kind of qualify.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't take people live on
Instagram with me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the Instagram live show every
Monday and people are like, can I jump in
[SPEAKER_02]: your live?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, there's no way to preview
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hit live and you're with me and you
could be, you'd be in your underwear or
[SPEAKER_02]: not in your underwear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be wearing less than your
underwear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be naked doing regular insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's perfectly closed insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can hit the X and get rid of you,
but if you're naked, everybody already
[SPEAKER_02]: sent you naked and then it's too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why I don't take people live
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody was wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do need to get you on more Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm talking about guests and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you say, we need to get you on more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear the audio monitor go off behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, are the kids cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone good.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is talking in his sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear what he's saying, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put them on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to edit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to edit this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's wondering where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what just happened is where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got two, uh, 30 in the morning as
early as.
[SPEAKER_02]: Studdly handsome fucking cool little guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are, you're making cool little men,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're going to be cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, like even I noticed that like,
I'm doing a pretty awesome job with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a 16 hour day job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, let's get three hours to
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I just, there's no energy left
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll fire you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you moving for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the boys for letting dad
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also big shout out to the wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if she'll watch this or hear
this, but fist bump to the wife for a
[SPEAKER_02]: watch and also fist bump for the help
you're giving me on that other thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: asked for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get older, breaking away gets easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting there little by little by
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can edit this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm crossing any lines, you just tell
me, but I never know until I ask,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, when, uh, and I know there's not a
number, but when do you think it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be time to, um, explain to them and
talk to them about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sort of already have started in like
the oldest one six and the younger ones
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like right now it's just dad
disappears into the garage like for dad
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the, the older one, like he goes
and takes a lot of time in his room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes and takes personal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've kind of talked to him a little
bit, like very kind of surface level,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, no details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just, I'm out there doing stuff
that like it's for adults, not kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With it right now, like the three year
olds, just like he wants to do everything
[SPEAKER_00]: with me and he doesn't get away from time
to time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're a six year old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you're a six year old dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's he's not sick, but he's fucking 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I talk to him, I'm like,
what, how did, who am I talking to over
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not somebody's little kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is somebody's like uncle or somebody
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination of, um, all of the medical
procedures and stuff that he's had to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through in his, uh, six years and COVID
just being home with me for a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half, but just hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was his, his playmate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was the daycare kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the teacher's aid, like all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that shit had an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the way the world is directly framed
by those two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not hanging out with, um,
cartoon watching booger picking kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's hanging out with dad all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to make this the
fatherhood podcast, but, uh, it was a good
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to ask, like, when do we start
talking about our kids about smoking herb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just cause I like your, uh,
your, your, uh, your model of parenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very much, um, like my wife and I,
we, uh, we sort of helped raise two of our
[SPEAKER_00]: nieces already there in their twenties
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we were not parental, but like
parental adjacent figures for them for
[SPEAKER_00]: their whole lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just went with brutal honesty was
the whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to put it in the context.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's age appropriate, but, um,
just, we don't lie to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, we frame it appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not daddy's outside doing
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dad's taking personal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give dad 15 or 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that aligned right about up with
dinner being ready and just roll right
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the same thing with wine or,
or, or alcoholic beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's adult juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not interested in it or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my daughter is 18 and I know,
Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I know she dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: She dabs with her friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: She dabs at the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't necessarily buy her flowers or
concentrates, but if she needs something,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'll give her a ride to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I won't go in and get it for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't like, I'm not against it or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I really had to, I would,
but there's gotta be some, like when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: her age, dude, we had to go find weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you had to find somebody with weed
and then he had to have money to get weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he had to buy the weed and pick
all the fucking seeds out of it before he
[SPEAKER_02]: could smoke some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't care that she smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chill out, have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not going to make it super easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you got to do some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not going to show up with,
with a bag of weed for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if she spent some of her birthday
money on a bag of weed, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's kind of how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like part of me wishes the current
generation had to go through some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that we did when we were teenagers to
acquire herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of me is really glad they don't
have to cause like, yeah, we got lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: kinda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it only got ugly and scary a couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I wouldn't want my dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want my kids driving three hours
because that's where the weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best price, like the three hour drive
is worth the $75 savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now she goes to the dispensary down
the street and she's 18 and got a weed
[SPEAKER_02]: card.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she can go in there and get,
get plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if there were rocks and stuff in the
pound, what was sprayed on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I always troll her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you've never even picked up a
weed before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've never picked seeds out of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I always want to just like get her
weed and throw a bunch of seeds in it and
[SPEAKER_02]: be like, now dig that shit out of there
before you smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: See that's what it used to be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking with somebody and they would
scissor stuff off a brick into a metal
[SPEAKER_00]: colander and then grind on it with like a
pedestal from a mortar and pestle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'd have the little colander and
you just grind around this lump of
[SPEAKER_00]: compacted earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one day somebody showed up with
real weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what do you, what do you
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is kind of a not compressed
brick weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, let's smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my brain went, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was already slept for seven
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I had to learn where to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to learn how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to learn how to breed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's bad, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody showed up with some really good
weed and it blew my fucking brains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a weird segue from asking when
you're going to talk about cannabis with
[SPEAKER_02]: your kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to smoke a fat one with both
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the time will come a long way,
but like it's, it's an event I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: desperately looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to beat the older one on a foot
race.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thinks he can run faster than me,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That ain't happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I mentioned you or he sees
something with your face on, except I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got, I re-merge all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I still have to race him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He owes me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe the kid a foot race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I can't wait, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's super rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about kids a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what I was rambling
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fell out of my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, parents is an excellent little sort of
little piece of this show that we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it definitely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause it's why you're never here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it correlates very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's an interesting balance that I
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it from older people in my family
that are like, so how are you the pot guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the good dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, it's, it's the,
you just said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the kids, like it's not complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow rooms locked and secured and in
another place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the kids are up there doing their
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like two different, yeah,
two different segments of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to, how to cops be good parents called
a gun cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a gun safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you cut out Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody can hear what you're saying,
but I don't even think you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now in the podcast, it'll just be
me talking over for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now you're totally froze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to keep talking for a
couple of seconds guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Mike is totally frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we'll give him a minute to recover.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about gun cabinet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a good cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a thing online called a gun
cabinet and like, it's like a gun safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's way lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mine came perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little section that for my
little two-foot bong and it's got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves for my weed and my hash and my
gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a nice, easy key system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep everything away from the little ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all you got to do the house is not at
all complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it wasn't, there's,
there's more than one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's, that's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you're thinking about laws is
you got to have a place to go smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an apartment, like,
and that was how I got people to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: legal to smoke on porches down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I just pointed out, like, what about
apartment smokers?
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want parents sitting in stuck
in an apartment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's where it's only legal to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like let the parent go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the parent go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's immediately changed that in the law
before we pass it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, did you hear the grateful dog episode,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I greatly enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been waiting for that episode for
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wanted to get you on it,
but also knew that that episode would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been three times as long if I put you on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just did it by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what, what, uh, what would you have
contributed bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a big smile on your face when I
asked you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just such a fun episode to listen
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause so when he's talking about like,
I got seeds from such and such,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I remember sitting in his,
his basement, um, smoking or bagging up
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and he didn't sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this genetic or that genetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have these five on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like which three should I order?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these ones got seized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to order them again, which one
arrived, what dumb ass merch was sent with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there was a line in the episode
where you talk about, uh, rolling up
[SPEAKER_00]: joints before going to red rocks for Ray
guy on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I distinctly remember sitting at your
kitchen table, grinding herb for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: roll joints with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that you were going to Ray guy on
the rocks and me not at all being
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in Ray guy on the rocks,
but we were hanging out smoking or
[SPEAKER_00]: recording that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sitting there with the grinder for
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you roll up 40 dubs?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, we used to, uh, I remember
you, the easy cloner showing up and you
[SPEAKER_00]: hit that part in that episode too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all those fun little evolutions I was
there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a fun episode to hear.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still my favorite of your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad you said that before I had
to ask you if it was your favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hearing that that's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a grateful dog shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that shirt would be,
but it would be a picture of Jerry Garcia
[SPEAKER_02]: and David Grisman because it's a band
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't really make my own shirt of a
band name.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite shirt or my favorite strain of
shirt I don't want to wear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make it because I probably get
sued by whoever owns the Grateful Dead's
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, Jerry's stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: David Grisman's stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if anybody out there wants to make a
bootleg grateful dog shirt, I wear an
[SPEAKER_02]: extra large and Mike's probably into a 3X
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, give or take.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pandemic's been rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: He quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, he quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll give him that credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right at the start of this fucking
thing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it looks like he just smoked bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: In March.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do is like, it's part of
the routine with the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cook all goddamn time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious, wonderful food that there's a
lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I really want to go off on a Grubhub
rant, but we'll keep the show positive
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a lot more notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have one more good question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I should have thought about my answer
before I asked you this, because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have an answer to this question right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a favorite product of the
year?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're wrapping up this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost Christmas time as we're
recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a good year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a favorite medical or
recreational cannabis product from this
[SPEAKER_02]: year?
[SPEAKER_00]: The rec products I buy the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you just completely cut out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get his attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I'm waving at him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll, I'll just talk till he comes right
back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's leaning toward the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's shaking his head, but you guys right
now, send me a tweet or an email and tell
[SPEAKER_02]: me what your favorite product is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What your favorite product was.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting him back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what your favorite medical or
recreational cannabis product was this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: What got you zuded?
[SPEAKER_02]: What works best medical or recreationally
for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we'll let Mike continue on with his
story of his favorite product of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the stuff I buy the most often is
either taste buds, gummies, a rec part
[SPEAKER_00]: product that is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a green dot black label stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the batters and the cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be my favorite product of the
year as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay cash for these products straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular dispensary gives me a
discount.
[SPEAKER_02]: The deal has nothing to do with green dots
because I was the first customer to shop
[SPEAKER_02]: in this dispensary when they opened for
recreational cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got kind of a VIP hook up there,
but honestly that's full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me the VIP pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get these for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green dot does not pay me promote,
advertise anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick fucking retail and I'm still
shouting them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the funny part is you're like,
well, Ross, to Jeff, you get that fat
[SPEAKER_02]: discount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you go get some for Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I buy my damn limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the limit and Mike knows I'm getting
eight of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go, the limit is so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we can't find the time to get on zoom
for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we could get to the dispensary
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you don't get your limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have you get me some flowers so that I
could try that a flower there that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was like, I'm not going to miss a
grandma concentrates to try those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limits tight now, especially with
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been going through a boatload of
those gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've like, I walk in and like,
give me two of those, two of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: two of those, two of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, please stop saying things
so that I don't have to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they realize when you stopped like,
Oh, this guy knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my buddy, Ricky,
one of the best blood tenders in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't often shout out blood tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out Ricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not just a good blood tender,
but a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, dude, the green dot black
labels, probably my product of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything with the, uh, what did I have
just the other day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just finished at the fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dude, I had a jaw, four gram jar of
fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything with the GMO, the garlic,
the Han Solo burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: The burger, anything in that realm from
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've tried fucking, I'll take it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I love the, I think you had a jar of
the Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had so much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had so much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll buy something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they got the Holy fucking something
else, probably take something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cause I swung so much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just held up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saving and I saved it until
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rewarded myself by finally getting my
podcast stuff set up with a gram or a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: little dab out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, that's what I was coughing on
when you, uh, when you let me into the
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I opened up the zoom meeting,
Mike hits the, uh, the let me into the
[SPEAKER_02]: damn zoom meeting button.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look up to let him in and I click
accept.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all I hear is like, she's taking
a big old fat bonger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his hand like one moment,
sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the little blue rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I don't want to jinx myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: This rig, uh, this rig has been around
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to clean my banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to clean the rig, but this thing,
uh, this little sidecar has been people
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about their favorite Reagan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I like, it's just the right size.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the flared mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have to like put my mouth on a
phallic shaped thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice and short.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the smoke goes down the stem and to my
brain, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at the end of these podcasts,
when I've gone through all of my notes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to give you the Mike's moments.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to be on here very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I need to edit this out,
I can, if I gave you a microphone and some
[SPEAKER_02]: time to yourself and I was like,
Mike, go ahead and ramble about whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to get off your chest today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of shit would you have to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, one of my, my hesitancies,
uh, get my setup going.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the little procrastination tools
I've been thrown around in my head is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I just try not to bring random
politics stuff to the show, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the safe banking act, if you follow
stuff going on in Congress, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give legal cannabis access to
banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some people were all for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even in the community, there's,
there's weird resistance because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's afraid of the corporate
takeover, which will be hastened by full
[SPEAKER_00]: access to banking, but that failed again,
which is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disappointing the community is still so
fragmented that they can kick our issues
[SPEAKER_00]: down the, down the street for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're, if you're of the bank,
being able to be involved is what is
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping your business afloat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your business plan is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to re strategize.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what's worrying you,
that's your argument for not being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: use the banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's, that's a, uh, it's an
insecurity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a weird fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a poorly planned for you can fix
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a major kind of, I don't know,
stumbling block in legal cannabis right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is an access to capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we can't go to the bank and get a
business loan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know somebody with private
capital, or you have to have, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: private investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a brutal system that
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's cut throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why owners are so stereotypically
douchebaggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's that's who's, who's funding it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not somebody trying to pay off a
business loan over 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somebody looking to, to triple their
investment quick and get out of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: hot thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That explains a lot of a thing that I talk
about on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often, um, uh, the commercial industry can
beat the shit out of a grower with passion
[SPEAKER_02]: because I became a lead grower and this
has happened in more than one environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you're in the commercial
industry, you realize it's kind of a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an owner who has finagled some
money out of somebody, some people,
[SPEAKER_02]: a group, a person with money.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gotten an owner has investors,
maybe multiple investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, then the owner has, uh, probably two
investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they've got a lead grower and a grow
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're telling different stories to
everybody because that investor every day
[SPEAKER_02]: wants their money back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growers telling them, I need nine
weeks to get it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're telling the grower that they're
going to just, so it's that pressure from
[SPEAKER_02]: that investor that all of a sudden they're
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden they're asking the grower
if they can shorten the flowering time to
[SPEAKER_00]: six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that's not how fucking
nature works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell the investor, we'll have it done
in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grower says nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell me I got it done in seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it doesn't reach the harvest goals
because we took it down two weeks early
[SPEAKER_02]: because the fucking owner of the place was
getting, uh, ridiculously overzealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't reach the goals or the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the investor gets mad about us not
making the money we should have made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a weird dynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could get those real bank loans,
uh, and have different, everything would
[SPEAKER_02]: be different with a decent fucking APR and
actually just get a loan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know that we got to pay this back over
this time is we have to sell this much
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means our first year we could struggle
by year two and three.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be going by your five.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're banging by 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all paid off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can make that kind of plan,
but when you got crazy investors,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it goes kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you don't get to do all the
things that you were hoping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sometimes they dangle more money over
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, Oh, we'll give you more
money after you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your first harvest and you harvest and
they don't give it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you promise people bonuses and then
there's no bonuses to be given cause you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't get the money anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything's so tight because it's all
private capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's just one of the one
more thing that's it's how many different
[SPEAKER_00]: things we have to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's one in three Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 120 million of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could all just get together for
45 minutes on one Wednesday, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: would be different, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the random stoner thought of the
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's what I gave you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, uh, this Mike's moments,
this open platform, that's what it was for
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the people that don't like
listening to the politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they got to listen to a good 30 minute
show and then they can, uh, not,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, not hear this part if they're not into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have to listen to their
comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good show to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody gets down on politics,
but it's like how everything functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just scanning headlines and I don't
have the time right now that I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to really keep up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every state's path through
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I saw that New York just had a whole
bunch of counties or I think they call
[SPEAKER_00]: them counties in New York, a whole bunch
of geographical squares of space,
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginary borderlines opt out or refuse to
opt in to legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to be like Colorado where
you can buy urban in Manitou, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs, or you can get urban
Pueblo, but not in, um, Walsenburg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can get weed in Walsenburg,
but yeah, 60 some counties in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: where you still can't buy herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to drive to the next county
over in some counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made ridiculously rich because it's a
small county next to a big county and the
[SPEAKER_00]: big counties refuse to opt in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the little counties never seen more
funding like Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, if you're not involved,
especially at the local level,
[SPEAKER_00]: like just weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to miss out on this,
you know, especially if you only go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary a couple of times a year,
you don't want to have to drive three
[SPEAKER_00]: counties over.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pay ridiculous taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, plenty of people drive to another
county just to avoid 30, 32, 35% taxes on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're buying a product that costs
200 bucks, that's 60 bucks in taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't have to pay that,
imagine how much more product you could
[SPEAKER_02]: leave with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, the taxes right now are incredibly
brutal because it's still illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So federal tax rule 280 E applies and you
can't deduct all the normal expenses from
[SPEAKER_00]: your business taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where the industry's health
insurance is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the health insurance money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bonus money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the raises money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go back for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I laugh at people pretending that
they'd go back to illegal herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you were a home grower back then,
like everybody else is way better off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you should have evolved by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be leading a dispensary or at
least being a top notch grower at a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary or a consultant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have evolved and adjusted and
adapted because those times are changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, maybe that's a good heads up to people
who are in markets, which are about to
[SPEAKER_02]: change or have recently changed,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an illegal grower and you're
just doing the black market thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: there will always be a demand and a need
for the free market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of those are going to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may want to re-strategize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may want to come up with something new
because eventually a lot of those gray
[SPEAKER_02]: market, free market opportunities,
those disappear when the legal market
[SPEAKER_02]: comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be ready for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The squeeze comes quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember, and it doesn't seem
like that long ago, but like me and Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: said earlier, we're old now, older now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you used to be able to make a
perfectly respectable living with four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five lights, three or four lights,
even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you, it ran a tight ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have three or four grow lights
in a house and to have a set of regular
[SPEAKER_00]: customers and make a perfectly respectable
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that went away about an hour and a
half after legalization landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you started to see, did you remember
all the people who tried to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in their living room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nailed shelves to the wall and had jars
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, for a minute there, that was
how, you know, we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, I've got another episode planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should give you a heads up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my goal is to have episode 719 about
our city and the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's beautiful.
Episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make it about our area code here is
seven one nine folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do seven one nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be about cannabis in the seven one
nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about how many jobs we've
provided, uh, and how things have gone
[SPEAKER_02]: like that and something I'll let Mike talk
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike, when we get done here,
start writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gave me a bunch of homework.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike, we were talking about some greedy
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in my opinion, it would just be
greedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would be the people that did not
want legalization to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never undo legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: People in jail for cannabis is like
fucking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, that's a word that we're not
supposed to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a word we're not supposed to say
anymore in this time, at the time of the
[SPEAKER_02]: year and this climate and this culture is
how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, people should be able to consume
cannabis and not have fear of getting
[SPEAKER_02]: locked up just for smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant people can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be able to do most of whatever
we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't bug anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd never undo that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something I would change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had changed a lot of my, uh,
a lot of my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me grow, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even mean it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me grow as a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me grow business wise in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me grow commercially, but it made
me grow, uh, as an adult, as a person,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a business person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, what, what are, what are we
going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was I going to do to sell weed
forever, grow weed and sell weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to evolve and move with the times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't just have a, that couldn't be
my hustle forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to learn other things and evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a certain point that would have gotten
really old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was tired when it was ending.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was done with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it, that's why it, yeah, that's why
we evolved it by the time it went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching all the different, different
evolutions has been really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, still wishing more people would get
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, um, if we could just complicate
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is a good time to like,
and subscribe Mike's Mike's high and
[SPEAKER_02]: running out of steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it on his face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but yeah, it's like one in the morning
and seven AM was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pumped some energy back into,
oh, Mike is saying like, and subscribe
[SPEAKER_02]: right now and then have two friends like,
and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also like I gave you, uh, your Mike's
moments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it is getting pretty late here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still do have some editing work to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to put some fanciness at the start
and end of this show, polish up this video
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like the sparkly stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to everybody who,
uh, gives me comments about the musical
[SPEAKER_02]: selections and the cool shit that I've
been trying, uh, to do with the start and
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that you noticed, um,
I gave you your moments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you got any final things to add to
this show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 700, bro, before we start wrapping
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just again, the show's been looking
and sounding great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the investments you're making in the
tech are paying off the hours you spent
[SPEAKER_00]: learning to edit the video or paying off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm digging the music in and out,
but I missed the original, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the mystic roots song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I missed that too, but I'm tired of
getting flagged by YouTube every time I
[SPEAKER_02]: use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know why it's not a thing,
but like every time I go to click on an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, there's a little piece of my
brain that goes, play the song,
[SPEAKER_00]: play the song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's not the song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get excited to hear what's in the
place of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it changes all the time now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to rotate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a few songs that are about 22
seconds, 18 to 22 seconds that fit the
[SPEAKER_02]: intros, try to play those little clips and
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, big shout out to the people that send
me music, make music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I make a lot of those myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to toot any horns,
but, uh, yeah, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't play the mystic root song.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like express written permission
and YouTube does not give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube's like, we don't care that they
give you permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The record label has given me permission
and YouTube doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Hey, look, Coot, they're giving
me a warning for using your music.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing you can do about it
sitting across the room from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't matter.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird music industry stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
