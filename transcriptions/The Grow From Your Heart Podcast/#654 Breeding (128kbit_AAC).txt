[SPEAKER_00]: I'm attempting to record in a multicam
format again Thank you for watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: multicam experiment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning this I did realize that in
the last episode there were a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: hiccups if you will I don't know what
happened dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm new at this We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come along for the ride with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it going I still feel like I put
out a quality episode last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the information really got lost
There was one jump cut where it felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of seconds of the video may have
disappeared I don't know what happened if
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't know I didn't notice it was
fucking perfect, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thank you for coming on this
multicam journey with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning together Somebody told me a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were worried about all of the
Technical additions to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want it to take away from the
podcast I'm not going to let it take away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the main focus of the show,
which is teaching you Sharing my knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: with you on how to grow quality cannabis
how to improve your garden today We're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna focus on breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a great question about breeding a
lot of people ask me about breeding It's
[SPEAKER_00]: time to talk more about it We're gonna do
that in just a moment Obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoned and rambly today, but I won't
let all the new gear distract me from the
[SPEAKER_00]: focus of the show I write the show I do
all the stuff on the computer on the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all that then we play with all the
gear I've just added a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't let it take from the previous
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just added more to it I think it's gonna
go well It's always got to keep evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: getting better or it will get stale got to
keep moving forward You guys can't stay
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were right move forward do what
you can do All right I should move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: and quit talking about the same thing This
episode will come out right after 7 10 7
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 snuck up on me this year There aren't
any major cannabis events going on in my
[SPEAKER_00]: area that I'm aware of No vending
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: No major consumption opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just came out of a really weird time
here in the world So nobody really
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared anything for the 7 10 event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a another non cannabis related
event I will be attending on 7 10 I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the only dab cadet in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else will be there for another
thing But yeah 7 10 snuck up on me when
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear this it will be Post 7 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a wonderful beautiful
7 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you stocked up on concentrates They
will sell out quickly this time of year
[SPEAKER_00]: the places where you go to get your dabs
may not have dabs because 7 10 is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly if you don't know about 7
10, we'll just ramble on to that one for a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment I have done a full podcast episode
one year ago did a full episode about 7 10
[SPEAKER_00]: I bust out a bunch of equipment I should
probably do that again now that I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: two cameras Maybe get another camera and
do that one But 7 10 if you flip the
[SPEAKER_00]: number 7 10 up Upside down it actually
says the word oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 7 10 is a good time to smoke oil We
take dabs now at 7 10 a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke flowers or a joint or a blunt or a
bong rip at 4 20 Now 7 10 is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke some dabs 7 10 is dab culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the new 4 20 So that's what I'm
talking about when I say 7 10 happy 7 10
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I didn't put out a 7 10 episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed that it snuck up on me this year
Like I said lots of stuff going on and no
[SPEAKER_00]: events So we didn't pay attention to 7 10
that light right there is making my eye
[SPEAKER_00]: twitch That was really awkward on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even gonna edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to Shaqari
Richardson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna delve too far into this
topic This is everybody's heard about it
[SPEAKER_00]: Every cannabis consumer has heard about
what happened to the lovely Shaqari
[SPEAKER_00]: Richardson a an Olympic runner has been
basically stopped from running not allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to run in certain events because she
failed a Cannabis drug test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had weed in her system the Place where
she consumed cannabis cannabis was legal
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time where she consumed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was legal there She was in a place
where she could smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also had a family member just pass
away I believe it may have been her mom
[SPEAKER_00]: just passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know god I don't even want to think
about that moment, but I'm gonna smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: some cannabis when my mom passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you but the person was just
doing life and where they were life was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and that was legal and because
they're an Olympic athlete because they
[SPEAKER_00]: did something that was a was legal where
they were now they can't compete in an
[SPEAKER_00]: event and That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of shitty that somebody can't
compete because of cannabis use also I
[SPEAKER_00]: have friends who are athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out with a couple yet I'm not an
athlete myself at all, but I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse group of friends Shout out to my
friend who had a conversation with me
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't want his name set on my show I'm
sure of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy who had a
conversation with me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's competed in major events I think he
may have been in an Olympic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was he's a wrestler.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's a wrestler his brother was a
UFC fighter they said that when you Are in
[SPEAKER_00]: these types of events that it's not just a
paper contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just read paper and you sign
shit and say that's the rules There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting there is a discussion people talk
to you and they put it into your head lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of times There is no cannabis use while
you were under this contract Yeah cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: may be legal in Colorado, Oregon,
California wherever you want to go that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's legal It may be legal there But if
you choose to be an Olympic runner you are
[SPEAKER_00]: forfeiting that this is your new thing
your new contract this rule supersedes all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those rules You can't do it just like
if you want some jobs you have to pass a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug test You can't do certain jobs if you
want to be a cannabis consumer the
[SPEAKER_00]: Olympics are the same way so there is kind
of a Being a person who wants freedom and
[SPEAKER_00]: free cannabis and legalized cannabis and
let's all smoke and have a good time And I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that athletes need cannabis just as
much if not more than anybody they're
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling their bodies hurt They're under
strain mentally and physically all day
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need something to calm down make
themselves feel better I think it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: good when I move heavy stuff after I take
a Dab after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I moved a bunch of heavy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think athletes should be allowed to
consume I think everybody should be
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to consume responsibly,
but she did sign a paper She did shake
[SPEAKER_00]: hands and say I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job depends on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a 50-50 I'm torn between
that how I feel on it was her
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility to not get caught consuming
cannabis is what that was She's gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That was her responsibility,
but where I'm leading to that I do want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give a shout out to one of her sponsors if
you know My personal life if you know me
[SPEAKER_00]: if you pay attention to my social media,
you know, I'm a big old sneaker head
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarantine kovat the lockdown got me
bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't allowed to go anywhere Usually I
go to a comedy show or a concert every
[SPEAKER_00]: single weekend if not two or three of
those a week during kovat I wasn't going
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere We were sitting here zooming and
being on a zoom video was not enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I developed a ridiculous sneaker
addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right I've got we won't go too far
into that because it could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may need an intervention Find me up on
intervention taking away My sneakers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to give a shout out to Nike
because Nike is Chicago Richardson's
[SPEAKER_00]: official sponsor and Nike did not revoke
their sponsorship, which I think is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cool in this day and age I feel like
such an old guy when I say that Your
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsors bail out if you say something
wrong very quickly your sponsors cancel
[SPEAKER_00]: you and forget about you very quickly if
you make the wrong move and for Nike to
[SPEAKER_00]: support Their indoor see I think that's
the appropriate word that just came out
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go With it for Nike to support
this in Dorsey like that and not drop them
[SPEAKER_00]: not fire them Not pull any ads not take
any funding not take any merch deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really cool So shout out to Nike
for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are gonna say you're shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big old corporation They're standing
up for a cannabis consumer, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cool and they've also been putting out
some cannabis friendly Shoes and merch so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's enough What is it pop culture
current news current events?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need enough of that on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need much of that on this show
Let's focus on cannabis A lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to listen to this episode
because this is going to be the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right I've got an email here about
breeding Many people listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not know that I am also the
founder breeder sole proprietor I am the
[SPEAKER_00]: one-man army of I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics premium seeds as a seed
company I slash we make regular and
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds I'm sure most people that
listen to the show know that but I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a few people out there that have
known No idea that I even make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something that may have not
gotten to their radar, but I make seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I read genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fairly well known for my breeding
technique my breeding methods my methods
[SPEAKER_00]: are tried and true I've got a couple of
male plants a few male plants have passed
[SPEAKER_00]: through my stable that have been proven to
be studs I've got a very reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of female plants and my breeding
skills have been proven and I think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with purpose and from a good
place so I feel like I can give you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: little rundown on breeding and a lot of
people have been asking for it is where I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I was headed with that a lot of
people have been asking me for breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: tips and I don't talk about it a lot on
the show honestly because I wanted to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to give all of the basic grow tips
first I mean I need you you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to grow it's not you don't need I
guess you it's better if I shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_00]: need because you can pull off seeds no
matter what if you try it's better if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to grow if you understand the
plant before you start breeding you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't in my opinion to start breeding
right away have a good relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant understand how it grows
understand the fun functions of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: then understand what you're looking for in
breeding build it just have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation so I wanted you to get that
before I started doing too much about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding also my business is breeding
that's part of what that's how I survive
[SPEAKER_00]: so why do I want to teach everybody else
how to breed but at this point I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: insecure with my role in the breeding
community with my role in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community I can teach you how to breed I'm
gonna do my thing forever it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: push me out of a job out of the market or
anything like that so I'm willing to share
[SPEAKER_00]: my knowledge grow from your heart breed
with love let's cut me off this fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: ramble fest and let's actually jump into
this email and we'll set up this part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show it goes just like this it says
Ross to Jeff I'm not sure if I'm submit
[SPEAKER_00]: submitting this in the proper area but I
am a longtime listener and I grow
[SPEAKER_00]: personally for companies and for myself
for over five years there's a lot there in
[SPEAKER_00]: that first sentence you did submit it to
the appropriate channel you sent that to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart at hotmail.com that
got right to me thank you longtime
[SPEAKER_00]: listener thank you I do appreciate that
longtime listener first time emailer it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like thanks for the great message
because this one is a good one got me off
[SPEAKER_00]: on a good ramble says I grow personally
and for companies now that's gonna get my
[SPEAKER_00]: attention because this is a breeding
question before I even get to the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: part let me ramble about this if you work
for a big company that has plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower and you are breeding at home it
is your responsibility as the grower slash
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder slash person with all the plans to
not pollinate that commercial growth you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow at work that's a commercial grow do
not contaminate that grow with pollen they
[SPEAKER_00]: are relying on that crop to pay your bills
your rent comes from that crop the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients the customers the consumers don't
want that crop seeded because you decided
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a new breeder a pollen chucker at
home if you successfully breed some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: without contaminating that crop at work
we'll call you a breeder if you fuck up
[SPEAKER_00]: and pollinate that entire crop at work
you're a shitty pollen chucker and you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do your job right so the first
thing you need to do is make sure in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion the first thing you should do
maybe need to do I try not to use words
[SPEAKER_00]: like should and need but this I feel like
it's appropriate you you need to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you should make sure not to pollinate that
big commercial grow people are relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: that to be seedless top shelf quality bud
don't seed that shit up so now once you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you're not gonna seed up that grow
then we can talk more about breeding there
[SPEAKER_00]: are several ways to make sure you don't
see that grow up change your clothes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: wash your hair wash water deactivates
pollen any time you're around that male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant when he's pollinating just squirt
yourself down with pollen change your
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes have clothes that you go in the
grow room with and your personal grow then
[SPEAKER_00]: grow clothes that you don't wear in the
grow so you come out of the grow you
[SPEAKER_00]: change clothes possibly take a shower
between those clothes if you have time if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's possible come out of the grow change
clothes put on fresh clothes then go to
[SPEAKER_00]: work and put on different clothes at that
grow so you're using different clothes in
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow different clothes at home and
different clothes in your home grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds tedious it sounds ridiculous but
with the experiments you're trying to play
[SPEAKER_00]: with and the money you're putting at risk
at that commercial grow it is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary everything from the hat to the
shoes need to be different don't take
[SPEAKER_00]: those same shoes in your grow that you do
to the commercial grow that should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: rule of thumb anyway you don't want to
move those bugs around and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in the car you're leaving work get
in the car those bugs are riding home with
[SPEAKER_00]: you you're bringing them into the house
you should change clothes take a shower at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point then go into your grow in
different clothes it's really hard to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it all separate but do the best that you
can keep that pollen away from the other
[SPEAKER_00]: grow really don't fuck up that grow so i
want to finish this message but that
[SPEAKER_00]: really stands out when you say i want to
breed at home and i'm working at a company
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's going to set off a lot of
alarms for a lot of people don't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody at the commercial grow that you're
breeding at home because if one seed pops
[SPEAKER_00]: up they're all going to blame you they're
gonna be like it's that pollen chucker
[SPEAKER_00]: that's breeding at home he just seeded
everything it's all gonna be your fault
[SPEAKER_00]: all right there is more of this message it
says now i'm deciding i want to try out
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding at a personal level at home is
there a previous episode number you can
[SPEAKER_00]: point me to for the best breeding guide
i've actually listened to two episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding terms but i'm curious if
you have a more of a guide formatted
[SPEAKER_00]: episode already thanks again for
everything much love uh do they say their
[SPEAKER_00]: name they don't say that they want their
name said so they know who they are they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need their name said on this episode
but they've got a great question let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk a little bit about breeding i do not
have a previous episode where i talk
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically about breeding i do talk
about uh pollination times i've talked a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times about male selection which
i'll touch on here but i don't think i've
[SPEAKER_00]: done the episode that i owe you for good
breeding so i'm going to take a sip of my
[SPEAKER_00]: drink here because i'm sure you could hear
it in my throat after i get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture on the face here we will talk
about breeding hang out here we go let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about breeding cannabis uh the main
thing one of the main things to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about is if you're gonna breed do you want
to pollinate all of the plants or just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of plants because uh pollen is hard
to control if you don't have some
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and a plan there are ways to
control the pollen but if you're new if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have some some strategy in place
you could really mess up like i mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier do not pollinate your work grow do
not pollinate your friends grow do not
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate the grow down the street think
about that sort of stuff be kind to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people around you a lot of people are
growing cannabis now and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are relying on that for medicine a lot of
people are also growing hemp all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place you've got to worry about getting
pollinated as well uh from other sources
[SPEAKER_00]: so i would recommend only breeding indoors
or in a greenhouse of some sort i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really trust outdoor breeding because if
some guy down the street gets a male he
[SPEAKER_00]: may breed with me on accident breed with
my plants on accident sounds better that
[SPEAKER_00]: way okay one of the main things to think
about when breeding is what is your goal
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a goal or are you just pollen
chucking if you're just pollen chucking
[SPEAKER_00]: that is fun too but it's much better much
more fulfilling uh much more rewarding and
[SPEAKER_00]: uh much more successful if you have a goal
how do you even know if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: successful if you didn't have a goal if
you're just putting plant a and plant b in
[SPEAKER_00]: a room together and putting pollen on the
plants and letting it happen and then
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the seeds that's fun but it was
their success in it what was your goal did
[SPEAKER_00]: you have something in mind did you want to
do something are you making seeds for do
[SPEAKER_00]: you intend to eventually be a commercial
seed producer will these seeds be put to
[SPEAKER_00]: market are you going to make seeds to give
to your friends are you going to sell them
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to pass them out at trade
shows are they going to be gifts are they
[SPEAKER_00]: are they something you intend on making to
give to disabled veterans who can't afford
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or um i don't know there's some
random group i was trying to think of some
[SPEAKER_00]: random group with like a bunch of random
names but then it almost got offensive in
[SPEAKER_00]: my head like um just random people from a
random place that do random things that
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy a certain thing all those together
in one group are you specifically finding
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for those people who can't afford
them whatever you're doing with the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: what is your goal or are you just going to
grow them at your house on your own or in
[SPEAKER_00]: your commercial grow on your own what's
your goal for the seeds think about what
[SPEAKER_00]: your goal is it's all about a goal a lot
of things in productivity of any sort it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all about your goal you can't get to the
destination to the end without a good goal
[SPEAKER_00]: from the very beginning so when we're
breeding when we're making seeds let's
[SPEAKER_00]: have a goal one of the first goals to
think of is what am i breeding for who are
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds going to how big is this going
to get so think about that from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning and kind of be prepared for that
from the start then your next goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve upon the cannabis species not just
to make this strain and this strain
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to name it the two
strains together would make a really
[SPEAKER_00]: clever name and you want to make a million
dollars off a cool strain name the cool
[SPEAKER_00]: strain name will get you so far but once
people grow those seeds and realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: they suck because you didn't do any proper
selection then that strain sucks and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a really popular strain name that
is known for putting out shitty plants so
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's not the way to do it have a
goal improve upon the species maybe you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got something that tastes really good but
it lacks potency maybe you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is super potent that
doesn't taste good maybe you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve upon that thing somehow then you
need to find a probably guess you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have a female if you're smoking it then
you need to find a male that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve upon that female when they breed
if you breed them together and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: make something that is worse or not better
than both of the plants you started with
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't really breed successfully in my
opinion unless your goal was to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: one trait if you don't care about the
potency and the way that it grows you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking for straight up that one sour
mango turp and that's all you're breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: for you can do that but I want potency
vigor things that people often forget
[SPEAKER_00]: about is stuff like pest resistance
pathogen resistance cold resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: drought resistance how does it handle
temperature swings diurnal swings humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: swings does it take stress well because I
put a lot of my plants in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and no disrespect to the ladies and
gentlemen at the commercial grow but
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes they're overworked and they're
stressed and they party too hard on the
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend or whatever is going on and the
plants have a little uh they don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: taken care of as much as they could have
maybe Saturday and Sunday the weekend crew
[SPEAKER_00]: might be hung over or whatever and the
plants deal with some stress I need them
[SPEAKER_00]: to survive that stress in the commercial
grow also I sell seeds commercially people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have never grown before are getting
my seeds I want them to have great success
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are going to beat these plants up
so it's all about selection we need plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to survive drought stress
problems being popped and twisted and
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulated a lot of these things are
going to be delivered by the male plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these traits come from the male
side of this equation and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are only breeding for flavor aroma we call
we call it in the industry Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: ability can you post this plant like is it
gonna look good is it gonna sell through
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram but then when you get it in your
garden like I said a minute ago you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it just grows like shit it grows
real skinny and it falls over and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds at the top is beautiful it's
fucking purple it's got red leaves coming
[SPEAKER_00]: off of it Instagram goes ape shit but it
doesn't grow worth the shit and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it the buzz is miserable and there's
no good flavor to it it just looks really
[SPEAKER_00]: good it hit a good lab test because it's
got a lot of trichomes on it but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing good about it other than paper and
Instagram so breed for the right stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: have a goal improve upon the plant and
don't just be pollen chucking and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just a pollen chuck so selection is key I
talked about a lot of the resistance path
[SPEAKER_00]: pest and pathogen we're just gonna call
that pet that's my new word right now pest
[SPEAKER_00]: and pathogen resistance comes from the
male a lot of that comes from the male so
[SPEAKER_00]: a good male is key to a good breeding
project male selection is very important
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done full episodes on male selection
but selecting the male let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing a male it's all about your goal
do you want to make indica or sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant plants do you want to make tall
skinny plants do you want to make short
[SPEAKER_00]: squatty plants do you want to make plants
that flower in 50 days do you want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that flower in 70 days do you want
to make plants that flower in a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and forty two days shout out to my buddy
lemur priest for his hundred and forty day
[SPEAKER_00]: finishers what do you want to make you've
got to choose a male that will contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits to the mix of course he's
only gonna give 50% maybe that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: else we're gonna talk about in a moment
he's only gonna give about 50% of his
[SPEAKER_00]: traits to this cross what is he shaped
like what does he smell like find a male
[SPEAKER_00]: that has traits that you want to work with
this is kind of like cheffing this male is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of your ingredients but we've only got
two ingredients to work with so what does
[SPEAKER_00]: this male bring to the table are we mixing
what are two flavors that are good
[SPEAKER_00]: together chocolate and anything right
chocolate and strawberries would be good
[SPEAKER_00]: together what else is good together I'm
just trying to think of random shit now
[SPEAKER_00]: but like savory stuff together is always
good but then if you go and mix two of the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong things together sometimes it just
doesn't fucking taste good that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is also you got to have the right
two ingredients if you mix the two bad
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients together it's just not gonna
work you can't put ketchup and milk in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same bottle and expect that to be good
sometimes breeding goes that way so find a
[SPEAKER_00]: male with the features that you're looking
for shape structure leaf size leaf shape
[SPEAKER_00]: colors does that male plant put out colors
are you looking for a plant that turns
[SPEAKER_00]: dark colors red colors purple colors look
for a male plant that exhibits those
[SPEAKER_00]: traits in the leaves flowering time we
don't want I personally don't want a male
[SPEAKER_00]: that takes way too long to flower but I
also don't want a male that shows me
[SPEAKER_00]: flower too early something I mentioned
this is a good segue into that if a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant flowers too early in my opinion he
contributes too much of himself to the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding mix my goal in breeding most of
the time is to find a male and a female
[SPEAKER_00]: that when they breed together you can find
a perfect balance of the male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: in the offspring you'll see offspring that
look just like mommy just like daddy and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you'll see some that you'll say man I
see mommy's growth structure in there it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells just like daddy does that
stretching thing that mommy does it does
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf shape of the daddy plant that is
my goal is to find a male that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: overpower the female but still puts enough
of itself into that cross to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: females different and the off to make the
offspring different and something new so I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want a male plant that flowers right
away if I have if I get a 10 pack most
[SPEAKER_00]: people buy a 10 pack of seeds if you got
10 seeds you're most likely going to find
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between four and six males in
there for the sake of my story we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: say you got five male plants the girls are
doing their thing we're gonna talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the boys that first male plant to flower
is way too eager he's like I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower here we go I don't want to breed
with him I think the offspring he makes is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be mostly like him it's gonna be
shaped like him it's gonna have the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: structure the build and it's gonna flower
too quickly if that plant gets root bound
[SPEAKER_00]: if that plant doesn't get enough light
it's got a what's the word propensity Wow
[SPEAKER_00]: big words for me today I'm not even sure
if that's the right fucking word but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going with it it could flower early
because that male plant that I used was an
[SPEAKER_00]: early flowering plant if I've got five I
generally choose the third or fourth male
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into flower and start showing me hey
I'm a strong male flowering plant I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to see big stamens coming off of it I want
to see rapid growth into flower that
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth or fifth one will be the winner
sometimes that's not the third or fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: or probably be the keeper that is not hard
and fast but that is kind of a rule of
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb and I I kind of have an eye when I'm
popping seeds I can see early early on
[SPEAKER_00]: early in veg like when they go from their
small like the cup or their small veg into
[SPEAKER_00]: their large veg pots I have usually
already decided that right there is my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding male these two over here the
keeper females I try not to let my my
[SPEAKER_00]: intuition like that ruin anything I try to
still be open-minded but most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm correct already at that point and by
the time it's dried and cured and smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else already agrees like you
were right bro we saw it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning because they've been around so
much we just train them and I share my
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas but um I kind of got myself lost
there on a ramble but I enjoy that find a
[SPEAKER_00]: good male plant that third or fourth one
is going to be your good male plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: early ones are going to put too much of
themselves into the mix that third or
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth one is going to be a good breeder
it's gonna have it's gonna pass enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: itself onto the female to show you what
it's got to offer and then the female is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to express itself in the
breeding project and like I said a moment
[SPEAKER_00]: ago that's when you get the offspring that
shows phenotypes that look like mommy
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that look like daddy and then
phenotypes that you could see that perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate strawberry mix half of it is
chocolate half of it is strawberry it's
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly beautiful you can see that
happen if your selections are proper if
[SPEAKER_00]: that is your goal also maybe that's not
your goal maybe you want to just recreate
[SPEAKER_00]: this female plant you got to find
something that doesn't adulterate it too
[SPEAKER_00]: much but most of the time the goal is to
make a cross of those two that is
[SPEAKER_00]: improving the species in my opinion you
don't want to just make a photocopy or you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to move backwards unless you've
got a specific goal so good male is key
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a male that displays trichomes if
your male plant is showing trichomes that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a good thing we want plants that make
trichomes if the males and females both
[SPEAKER_00]: make trichomes that should add up to
shebang double trichomes right if you got
[SPEAKER_00]: a Mendel chart and you see trichomes
trichomes that's gonna be fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes with a capital T right there on
your chart baby aromas I like a male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna think I'm crazy I say this a
lot I say this often and I mean it I do a
[SPEAKER_00]: stem rub on the plants early flower I can
already tell about week two week three of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower what these plants are gonna start
smelling like for me I just grabbed the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem and just rub it with my fingers and
smell it and if it smells like vomit and
[SPEAKER_00]: trash can and acrid disgustingness maybe
some funky feet maybe some rotten socks
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a plant that I want to breed with
I don't choose to breed with the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: candy smelling males because I've got
those females I like an acrid funky male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's just gross I also like a
plant with a good structure that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to me it's got to grow with the
good structure it's got to take some abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: I will put just like most people do a
pheno hunt I don't know how long it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: since I've talked about a proper pheno
hunt we'll talk about that that's when you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a number of seeds and you find the
winners out of that pack of seeds you are
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting for the phenotype that you select
I will do a pheno hunt for boy plants I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it's Colorado so I'll grow 12 seeds
at a time and I'll find the females out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there and just toss them immediately and
now I've got six or five male plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with and I'll watch them grow and
I'll find the best boy out of there and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull him aside and then now I've got
one plants and I've got 11 more seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can crack and I'll run 11 and I'll find
another boy in there and compare it to
[SPEAKER_00]: that first one and I've done that a couple
times until I found stellar males so run a
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno hunt until you find the male plant
that you want if you've only got 10 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a male in there that will work for
you if you've got a hundred seeds your
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to find a stellar male are
much better how do you know when you found
[SPEAKER_00]: a good male the only way to audition your
stud plant is to pollinate in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple female plants with that plant you
could pollinate one plant with it and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what it makes maybe you just made one
really awesome cross that's fun if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want to do but if you really want
to tell if that male is a good breeder hit
[SPEAKER_00]: him to several female plants with
different traits all of those plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: to have different different traits I've
got a strawberry starburst that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like strawberry bubblegum or it's a
strawberry fields from Crockett smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like strawberry bubblegum I've got a
platinum tangy from Garden of Whedon it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells straight up like oranges so if I
hit my male plant to the strawberry and my
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant to the tangy I could tell I get
this strawberry and something and oranges
[SPEAKER_00]: and something and I can tell what this
male plant is bringing to the mix I can
[SPEAKER_00]: see that when I cross it to this one and
to this one that all of the offspring got
[SPEAKER_00]: tall and made big purple leaves or I can
see commonalities or outliers through the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding by doing multiple female plants
like if I hit four or five different
[SPEAKER_00]: females I could tell what that male is
going to offer if I just hit one I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know sometimes if the things that come
from that offspring were traits from the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents they could have been so if I
use I'm just going to say plant A and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant B it's going to be easier that way
if I use plant A and plant B and I make
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring and I named that number one and
number one shows me things that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: displayed in plant A and plant B it could
come from the grandparents or the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant A or plant B plant A's parents or
plant B's parents and I wouldn't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: if I don't know that plant's parents so if
I use multiple females I know if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing recessive traits or traits from
grandparents or traits from
[SPEAKER_00]: great-grandparents or if I'm seeing stuff
that is displayed from the male people
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder why seeds are so expensive you guys
to do it properly to do it correctly to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it sustainably to do it to where you're
around for a while it does take some work
[SPEAKER_00]: some research some effort some care some
effort that's a lot of it is effort a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people just think they're gonna put two
plants in a room and let them hump and
[SPEAKER_00]: make some seeds and make some money that
will work a couple of times but then
[SPEAKER_00]: people are gonna buy those seeds and
they're gonna grow them out and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go yeah these are not what I was
hoping for we're gonna go find a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been doing some testing and read
some books and figured it out so um find a
[SPEAKER_00]: good selection pollinate several females
with different traits know your goal when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing this the first time you're
doing it you're kind of looking to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what the male plant does but you've
probably got some plants you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working with for a while find a male plant
that is different than the girls if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a bunch of crazy sativa females maybe
find an indica heavy male or something
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're looking to make even more
sativa heavy females find something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna reach your goal but it's more fun
when the male is different than the female
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can see what the male is doing
to that mix I keep saying stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: but once you get there and you have the
seeds and you start growing and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've created if it all looks the
same you're gonna go my male plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: really dominating the mix here because all
of these crosses all smell like foot and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get any strawberries I don't get any
oranges I don't get any blueberries like I
[SPEAKER_00]: expected from the females I'm just getting
that bar trash can and puke from the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant you know he's too powerful got to
choose a different male for that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: never a bad thing this isn't on the notes
yet but we're gonna go into this part as a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible breeder something you've got
to do is know when you've made some trash
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've just made a bunch of seeds and
you grew out a bunch of them and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: not impressing you they aren't better than
the parent plant that you started with
[SPEAKER_00]: don't sell them don't pass them out don't
try to recoup your losses this was a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project where you learned these
plants don't breed well together you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to get rid of that or just grow it
yourself or maybe f2 it or bc or b exit
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever one you want to use shout out to
my buddy f1p work with it yourself those
[SPEAKER_00]: are yours but maybe if they're not stellar
if they're not impressive don't put them
[SPEAKER_00]: out don't sell them that's when you go
making a bad name for yourself if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be around to be in the industry for a
while do things correctly be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: impress us with your products the internet
is here forever all of the shit you do and
[SPEAKER_00]: say now is recorded documented programmed
written down digitally stored backed up on
[SPEAKER_00]: a hard drive fucking stored in a cloud
ready to be used against you in the court
[SPEAKER_00]: of law the court of the internet facebook
court instagram court whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: court it is time for somebody is ready to
blast your shit so do things correctly if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to stick around in this industry
in this scene right now if you're a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder if you're a creator of some sort
in this industry you are a pioneer you can
[SPEAKER_00]: either be remembered for years to come as
a pioneer in this industry or you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those people that popped up made a
couple of bucks we realized you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to fuck us for a couple of bucks
and now you are gone are you here forever
[SPEAKER_00]: are you part of the industry are you here
for the cash grab now's the time to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision if you're trying to get into the
seed breeding game for the market all
[SPEAKER_00]: right that was my weird rant for this
episode um yeah if you didn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: something good don't share it that is your
responsibility to make that decision so
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate a bunch of females grow that
shit out multiple females are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you what the male does to the mix see
what he does is this male plant adding
[SPEAKER_00]: value is he adding value to the crosses or
is he just making a bunch of reproductions
[SPEAKER_00]: of the females or a bunch of reproductions
of himself or is he making hemp if hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: your goal you're reaching your goal but if
that's not your goal we've got to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out which male plant we can use in the
future to reach your goal crack more seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: find a better male repeat the process this
is why seeds get expensive i have thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: away male plants i've thrown away batches
of seeds uh for every cross i for every 10
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses that i released there are probably
five to ten more that didn't even make it
[SPEAKER_00]: uh it's not that they were terrible but i
only want to put out nines and tens and
[SPEAKER_00]: elevens there's a lot of people out there
that are okay with putting out fours and
[SPEAKER_00]: sixes and that's cool but i that's just
not how i operate i'd rather put out nines
[SPEAKER_00]: and tens and elevens because i've got the
opportunity i know i can do it why waste
[SPEAKER_00]: your time and my time with a six if you're
a six i still love you um where are we in
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast i'm having fun today shout
out to dabs by the way happy seven ten
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody i hope you guys have a had a
wonderful seven ten is that male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: adding value i hear oh it's the phone
giving me interference i hope you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't hear that come through the
microphone something just rattled like
[SPEAKER_00]: chubaca in my headphones i was the phone
doing interference with the gear here
[SPEAKER_00]: enough rambles is that male plant adding
value to your cross is he doing good or is
[SPEAKER_00]: he just making more hemp seed for you more
bird seed don't be afraid to throw away a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project go back
[SPEAKER_00]: start over do it all over again that's how
you learn the most it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a good learning experience it
doesn't really take that much time that
[SPEAKER_00]: long that much space uh this isn't on my
notes but let's ramble a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: think that breeding requires a lot of
space it doesn't it requires very little
[SPEAKER_00]: space you can breed with very small plants
honestly when i'm making a new cross if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something that has never been made
before and i think that plant and that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant right there i should put them on a
date i should put them in a room and i
[SPEAKER_00]: should let them do they thing and then
we'll have some seeds those plants grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: a six inch net pot and they're about eight
inches tall maybe ten inches tall when i
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them i do not top them i grow them
they get eight to ten inches tall they go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower i pollinate them and then we
get about somewhere between 30 and 100
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds depending on the plant some plants
uh take pollen really well and give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of seeds uh some are kind of stingy
but some of them will just throw out seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: either way i
[SPEAKER_00]: have got enough to play with i can grow
just pollinate all 11 of those little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: six inch net pots under one led light real
small plants real small pots grow them up
[SPEAKER_00]: just a couple of weeks flower them out
pollinate them and then i do the 18.6
[SPEAKER_00]: trick once i get them good and pollinated
i put the lights back on 18.6 and i
[SPEAKER_00]: actually move those little tiny plants
back to my veg space they don't even waste
[SPEAKER_00]: any space now there's in the corner of the
veg space they're getting what they need
[SPEAKER_00]: they're on 18.6 they're going to finish
flowering in about six to eight maybe nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks hopefully not that long depending on
the strain i will have somewhere between
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 and a thousand seeds from each plant to
play with uh did i say a thousand 30 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 seeds from each plant to play with and
that's enough for myself and lemur and
[SPEAKER_00]: mobius and rosin man and uh zozo to run
them and see what we've got and then if i
[SPEAKER_00]: find out they're all good or if i find out
they're all terrible we move forward from
[SPEAKER_00]: there if they're good i've still got the
clones of the original plants make a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: more this time we'll run it in a seven
gallon pot grow it up a little bit bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate it make enough seeds to last for
a minute so we could stock up all the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors but you don't need a lot of space
you need the same things that you need for
[SPEAKER_00]: your regular grow you need a dark space
that you can control the dark on i like to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw them into either 11 13 or 12 12 for
a few weeks get them into flower get that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen on there so let's talk about this a
little bit more specific detail get them
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower around day 23 to 32 depending
on the plant is when they want pollen if
[SPEAKER_00]: you pollinate early your seeds will be um
they're more likely to be more uniform and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier if you pollen right pollinate
right in the middle you will get more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and they'll still be healthy they'll
still be uniform if you pollinate too late
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds will start to get uh not as
round you'll get more twins you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: more weirdos if you pollinate too late so
it's all about timing that plant some of
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants want pollen i've talked about
this uh the platinum tangy is ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen at like day 23 of flower she's like
pollinate me i'm ready to go strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: fields i gotta wait till like day 27 or
day 30 to give her pollen if i hit her too
[SPEAKER_00]: early she doesn't make enough seeds if i
hit her too late she doesn't make good
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds so it's all about timing when it
comes to breeding you may need to learn to
[SPEAKER_00]: put uh strawberry starburst or strawberry
fields into the room a week ahead maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks ahead then drag the platinum
tangy in there two weeks later let those
[SPEAKER_00]: flower then drag the male the male should
already be in there so we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: male timing but you want to pollinate the
plants around day 23 to 27 maybe 32
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the plant you want those
pistols to be big and bushy and strong
[SPEAKER_00]: looking now let's talk about timing the
male plant your male plant's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start dropping pollen around day
14 really get going around 17 really
[SPEAKER_00]: dumping by 23 kicking it out by day 26
your plants are ready for pollen by now
[SPEAKER_00]: but uh you may want to get the females a
little bit ahead you may want to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: male a little bit ahead it depends on your
strategy what you want to do i've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate place for my male so i can get
him ahead and he's really dumping pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: so he's probably a week ahead of the other
so he's putting out good pollen some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that later pollen is better in my opinion
the early pollen is good the later pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be more productive not super late
but like four or five week six pollen is
[SPEAKER_00]: really good put that on the week three
week four females and it really goes
[SPEAKER_00]: shebang so get your boy get him
pollinating if you've got one space put
[SPEAKER_00]: them all in there at the same time and do
what you've got to do i understand how it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes it will work a lot of the things i
talk about are specifics that we will dial
[SPEAKER_00]: things in and give you the best results
this is growing cannabis on a homegrown
[SPEAKER_00]: level i understand sometimes you just got
to throw some plants in a room and do what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do so if that's what you've got to
do do that so you've got your females in
[SPEAKER_00]: there they're going to want pollen around
day 23 27 30 32 at the latest uh your
[SPEAKER_00]: boy's going to start dropping pollen
around day 12 14 17 he'll start dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: it like 25 by day 30 you can't fucking
walk around him because when you touch the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor you could see pollen fall off of him
that's the point where i would drag him
[SPEAKER_00]: over to the females put him right in the
middle of the females and just shake him
[SPEAKER_00]: just grab him right by the base and give
him a good shake just like if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to whip somebody with him just whip all
those female plants with them the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to go flying it's going to go
everywhere at this point you're achieving
[SPEAKER_00]: full pollination those plants are getting
it you're going to taste pollen you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have pollen in your teeth in your
nose you're going to breathe pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to sneeze it's going to suck
you're going to have bright yellow boogers
[SPEAKER_00]: for a whole day you can't get rid of it no
matter what you do your eyes are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel red and itchy i think that part of my
redness and weirdness from my eyes today
[SPEAKER_00]: is from pollen big shout out to my king
solomon for making my eyes itchy it's
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it uh it could be that light could
be solly uh but pollinate go in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: just spread that pollen i put the plant
right in front of a fan sometimes just let
[SPEAKER_00]: the fan fucking blow the pollen everywhere
then i wait a few days maybe one maybe two
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three days then i will pollinate
again now that male plant in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: has done his job he's done i will cut him
down and smack him against something
[SPEAKER_00]: either the fan or the lights just getting
all that pollen out into that room just go
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkle them all over the female plants
make them actually make contact i'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to make maximum pollination where every
pistol has been pollinated i want maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds because you guys buy every seed that
i make and i cannot keep up with you thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you i love you for that but i need to make
as many seeds as i can so you drag them in
[SPEAKER_00]: there uh pollinate pollination should
happen females are ready i keep saying it
[SPEAKER_00]: around day 23 about day 27 30 32 ish your
boy's dropping around 17 a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: later is the best pollen day 25 is really
killer pollen uh get them in there juice
[SPEAKER_00]: up those girls let the pollination set
pollinate one more time cut down the boy
[SPEAKER_00]: clean up the pollen get that boy out of
there now you're just dealing with seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: females at this point that's when i put
the lights back on 18.6 i've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: this a lot there are full episodes about
this in my opinion this works really well
[SPEAKER_00]: to speed up the finishing process to make
the seeds finish faster they finish harder
[SPEAKER_00]: uh they're fatter they're stronger excuse
me for that they're fatter they're
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger some of the best seeds i have
ever made have been finished under the
[SPEAKER_00]: 18.6 finishing cycle the best seeds i have
ever made were finished under an 18.6
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle and they were grown under
canon leds i'm going to take a quick drink
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll continue the rant about breeding
all right so we've achieved pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: we've put our lights back on 18.6 now
we're going to feed the plants the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion don't need the bloom
boosters like we normally feed them
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're not going for flower when
you put your plants on 18.6 let me tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you that this is going to happen they're
going to look like shit we've got to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them several weeks for these seeds to
finish up the plants are going to revege
[SPEAKER_00]: don't worry don't stress on that we're not
growing buds your intention is not to make
[SPEAKER_00]: big pretty flowers at this point at this
point we are fully focusing on seeds we
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing a seeded crop you are now
growing seeds before we were focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes and bag appeal flowers now it is
just healthy fat seeds the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go back into a vegetative state
because we've got them on an 18.6 lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle in about 14 17 21 days you're gonna
see little new shoots coming out of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants do not freak out do not panic don't
cut them off don't do any weird shit let
[SPEAKER_00]: them keep growing your plants are gonna
look weird and crazy don't worry you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing four seeds take a lot of pictures
post it to social media see what people
[SPEAKER_00]: think they're gonna freak out they're
gonna tell you cut it down it's a mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not gonna know what the fuck is
going on just sit back and laugh like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mad scientist because it's really fun to
see people freak out on a seeded crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: is fully reveging if you need clones in a
few weeks before you harvest you will have
[SPEAKER_00]: clones they'll be popping out right out of
the tops of these seeded plants you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have brand new clones cut those off use
them just like normal clones that is a new
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant don't flower that one out let
that one grow out until the leaves get
[SPEAKER_00]: normal again then take clones off of that
you can flower those those are your new
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you can get seeds and clones off of
the same plant that is a crazy trick that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a couple of times so you've
got your plants they're on 18-6 they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna continue to flower they don't need
the bloom boosters like they normally do
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're not growing buds they do in
my opinion need enjoy and appreciate a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of amino acids amino acids are
great building blocks to life if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a product with amino some sort of
liquid amino in there add that to it also
[SPEAKER_00]: they do like a little extra cal mag
they're also going to appreciate a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of nitrogen if you're a bottle grower
I just basically don't switch the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle to the bloom bottle when my feed
schedule says put in the excuse me let me
[SPEAKER_00]: fix my brain when the feed schedule says
put in the bloom bottle I just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: switch from veg to bloom I continue that
veg bottle all the way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle I don't do a flush phase
like you normally do that's because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna smoke and I want to feed my
seeds so yeah the main nutrient difference
[SPEAKER_00]: is they want a little bit more cal mag
they want some amino acids and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: switch to the flower nutrients I just use
that veg bottle most other things are
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the same I don't defoliate as
heavily honestly they don't grow as bushy
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're spending most of their
energy on making those seeds so then you
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta let them finish that's where I'm
headed we're feeding them they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: grow they're just gonna keep on growing
try to don't get it too humid don't spray
[SPEAKER_00]: try not to spray because you've got seeds
in there if you get them too wet too humid
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds will germinate inside of your
buds I've seen it before I've seen little
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouts growing out of live plants it's
really beautiful but you just ruined your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and your seeds and you kind of
fucked up everything unless you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to make some living soil there's nothing
to be used there so let them grow let them
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to grow don't let it get too
humid you want it the same conditions as
[SPEAKER_00]: you do a normal grow environment so you're
already doing that feed them water them
[SPEAKER_00]: then you will notice that the seeds are
starting to get hard a lot of people say
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I know when the seeds are ready
hopefully these plants are really seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: up all you have to do is find a branch
that you're okay with just kind of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mangling a little bit grab a bud and just
pinch it and pull out a seed and then roll
[SPEAKER_00]: it between your fingers the bud will fall
off the casing will come off all the calyx
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that part will fall onto the floor
and you'll just have a seed in your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: pop it right into your hand and check it
out is it white is it pale is it gray is
[SPEAKER_00]: it getting tiger striped is it dark is it
black then is it hard give it a squeeze if
[SPEAKER_00]: it crushes that's when you can tell a lot
when it crushes does it just go squish if
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing comes out you're nowhere near
ready if a little white gooey thing comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out you're getting close if it's hard and
kind of goes crunch and white gooey shit
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out you're getting really close if
it's hard and when you pinch it it makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little indention in your finger then
you're probably ready but go a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer it's gonna take six to eight maybe
nine weeks for these seeds to harden up
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly from the time you pollinate until
the time you cut them down is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: six to eight maybe nine weeks it is going
to be very plant specific it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very environmental specific there are a
lot of things that will come into play to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide how long these seeds need to go
before you harvest them I want to read my
[SPEAKER_00]: notes and make sure I didn't miss anything
because I got stoned and I went kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fast and I did lose track of where I was
at one point I want to make sure I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: miss anything for you select plants select
a female select a male get them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right point in flowering put them in the
room let them do their magic on each other
[SPEAKER_00]: then switch the light cycle to 18 six feed
them properly basically give them veg
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients all the way through give them
aminos give them Cal Mag give them
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen that should keep them happy don't
let them get root bound don't get them too
[SPEAKER_00]: humid they're on 18 six let them go long
enough then I think we can talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting let's harvest one of the best
parts about growing for seed is you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really have to trim it's all just gonna
none of it's gonna get smoked well unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna try I don't do that I don't
feel it's useful I feel like it's a waste
[SPEAKER_00]: of time so before harvest while the plants
are still alive still growing still well
[SPEAKER_00]: still turgid is the word I'm looking for I
will pull off as many leaves as I can get
[SPEAKER_00]: just defoliate with my hands maybe
scissors but put on a pair of gloves and
[SPEAKER_00]: just go pull off all of the leaves because
when I cut the plants down I don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: that much leaf on there so I go in I cut
off all of the leaves or pull off all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves as many as I can get then the
next day I cut the plants down and I hang
[SPEAKER_00]: them upside down and put a label on them
that way I know that this plant is for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure this plant it was the female this I
already know what it was pollinated by
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was my breeding project then I
just simply let it dry I don't even put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in a dry and cure room I just hang
them in a basement where the air is and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just dry in that natural environment
I'm not curing them I'm not drying them
[SPEAKER_00]: specially we're not gonna smoke them this
is all seeded product a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: think that it's insane or there's a
problem with just seeding this up and not
[SPEAKER_00]: even attempting to save the material by
the time I'm done sorting it and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds out of it it is so beat up that
it is not worth it any edibles that you
[SPEAKER_00]: make tastes like crap it tastes like
chlorophyll any concentrates you make come
[SPEAKER_00]: out green and terrible because it's so
beat up it is not worth the time energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and effort the material goes into the
compost bin or the Bokashi bucket is
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly what happens to that material so
we cut down the plants they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliated heavily we cut them down they
hang upside down or you can lay them on
[SPEAKER_00]: racks if you want but the seeds may start
falling out as it dries up as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: got something to catch the seeds and keep
them separated keep them separated so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get any cross-contamination or
cross labeling of seeds chop the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: down hang them up let them get this is how
I do it I let them get crispity crispity
[SPEAKER_00]: crunchity dry they're super butterfinger
dry then I will get a container I wish I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have brought one to the table it is
a stir light container I believe is the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand stir light makes them rubbermaid
makes them there's a bunch of generic
[SPEAKER_00]: brands that make them at the big box
stores where they sell you all the plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: shit you can get these containers it's
probably 18 inches 16 inches tall deep you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to call it it's about three
feet wide and it's about a foot and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: thick it's like a big box basically is all
a big plastic box I will grab a pair of
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves and I will put my plant in that box
and I basically grab the plant by the base
[SPEAKER_00]: of the stock and I put my hand around all
the buds and run my hand right up the main
[SPEAKER_00]: stem and just shuck all the buds right off
the stem it is so dry that as I run my
[SPEAKER_00]: hand up the stem and push all these buds
off they just fall right off the stick
[SPEAKER_00]: into the container so now all the buds are
off the sticks they're all into this
[SPEAKER_00]: container I've got a couple of methods for
removing the seeds at this point but some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the easiest ways are just put on gloves
and just grind it all up with your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: don't smash too hard you'll know when
you're going hard enough to destroy seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you've got all the plant matter in
that container and you just start grinding
[SPEAKER_00]: it up with your hands you will hear those
seeds hitting that bin just if you did it
[SPEAKER_00]: right it sounds like it is raining seeds
into that container it is a very when you
[SPEAKER_00]: grew seeds on purpose and you hear that it
is a very satisfying feeling another
[SPEAKER_00]: really effective way of getting these
seeds out of these buds is to remove all
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds from the sticks you got to get
most of the sticks out because we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put all these buds into a one gallon
ziplock bag as many as you can get it into
[SPEAKER_00]: that one gallon ziplock bag and then I
just kind of roll my hands around that bag
[SPEAKER_00]: and squeeze it and crumble it these buds
are dusty bone dry so as I'm doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making dust out of all of that
bud then I personally use a seed sorter
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a machine that I pour the seeds
and all the the other material is called
[SPEAKER_00]: chaff so I pour the chaff and the seed
mixture into this one part and seeds come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of one end and the chaff comes out of
the other I've got to run it through a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times to make sure I don't miss
any seeds but once I get the rhythm of the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine I can pull out a lot of seeds
quite quickly if you don't have a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: sorter there are a lot of ways to figure
out how to get the seeds remember that the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds roll and the chaff is fluffy and
stays at the top you could do it just like
[SPEAKER_00]: we used to back in the day get an album
run the seed run the material up the album
[SPEAKER_00]: and the seeds fall down the material stays
at the top there are a lot of ways to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it this is a seed breeders version of
trimming you guys out there trimming you
[SPEAKER_00]: always talk about how you want to put the
scissors in your eye and that you hate
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming pulling the seeds out is that's
the headache for a breeder if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the machine if you've got the
machines they will do you very well there
[SPEAKER_00]: is the easy grow seed sorter is what I
think it's called the easy seed seed
[SPEAKER_00]: sorter that is a great machine my buddy
Cascadian Grown is putting out the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: models if you need something to do a few
more seeds Cascadian Grown is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: more affordable so find him on social
media shout out to Cascadian Grown there
[SPEAKER_00]: you go brother free plug just because I
want to support the community also there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another guy I saw damn I really wish I
remember who saw the who made the plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: 3d printed version it was smaller but
still all three great products no bias no
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah just three products you could use the
are all three seed sorters another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen done I think I learned this from
mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: soul I like to share resources so you
don't think I'm a wizard I do learn shit
[SPEAKER_00]: from a lot of other people mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: soul puts his buds he takes the sticks out
he's got just buds in a five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: and he taught us to get a drill and then
at the hardware store they sell a paddle
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a drill bit so it hooks into your
drill just like a normal drill bit but it
[SPEAKER_00]: is to stir paint is what I believe it was
originally made for and you put your drill
[SPEAKER_00]: on like a low setting so you don't destroy
the seeds and just go into the five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket and just give it a few zip zip zip
you don't want to go in there and murder
[SPEAKER_00]: it but give it a few zaps and if the
material is dry enough just give it a zip
[SPEAKER_00]: zip zip it'll just shatter that material
and rupture the material and the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: just go fly into the edge of the bucket it
will not break the seeds if you put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: a low setting and you do it gently and pay
attention if you go in there and start
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking mashing them on the bottom and
making mashed potatoes out of it you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the seeds but if you're smooth
about it you pay attention watch what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing you will not destroy the
seeds it is a quick way to get them out
[SPEAKER_00]: then all of the chaff is at the top all
the seeds are at the bottom pull out a few
[SPEAKER_00]: handfuls of the chaff that'll help you out
so start sorting those seeds much more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly seriously pulling the seeds out is
the really the challenging part unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making packages I package seeds by
hand every seed that you buy was packaged
[SPEAKER_00]: by me I touched that seed I rolled it on
the table made it was hard made sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: was hard that was weird touch that seed
made sure it was hard all right rolled it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the table made sure it was hard I put
all those seeds into the packaging myself
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to touch them but counting to ten
and counting to twelve and counting to six
[SPEAKER_00]: does get quite tedious I make sure to put
extra seeds in there for you but that is
[SPEAKER_00]: my version of trimming that's what I'm
just like all right my eyes are crossed I
[SPEAKER_00]: need a break so we've gotten all the way
to selecting plants we've gotten all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up to harvesting we've gotten to
pulling the seeds out now you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: count them it's always good to count your
seeds I know that sounds tedious and
[SPEAKER_00]: monotonous I've got a machine that does
that I simply drop my seeds in a machine
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hit go and it vibrates and it counts
the seeds for me beautiful beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: machine hopefully you've got a friend
maybe a lovely girlfriend or somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: will sit around and count seeds with you I
just count them out sometimes you could do
[SPEAKER_00]: it by weight you'll get close enough if
you just want a good idea sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: could tell that this many in a baggie is
about a thousand seeds you'll get good at
[SPEAKER_00]: it eventually count them because you want
to know how many seeds you made because
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to know how many you make next
time so that you can make if you make five
[SPEAKER_00]: more next time that's improvement but you
want to just document stuff I like to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of notes I like to make excessive
notes that way I know where progress is I
[SPEAKER_00]: know where I'm slacking I know where I'm
improving all right now let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the most rewarding part of this entire
project now it is time to grow the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: we have produced did we make trash did we
make the next gems did we make the newest
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog did we make the new gorilla glue
did we make the new popular shit that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have everybody lined up at the
dispensary or did we just make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex mutant plants and nobody wants to
grow the only way to find that out is to
[SPEAKER_00]: sprout them and grow them the first thing
you want to document is germination rate
[SPEAKER_00]: however many seeds you grow write it down
how many germinated write that down that
[SPEAKER_00]: is your germination rate if you popped 10
seeds and only seven of them sprouted
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a 70% germination rate not
really acceptable for commercial seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: those are good for you you need at least
80% germination to put them out to market
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% is better if they don't have 90%
germination rate at least put 13 seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: that package when you sell them do
something like that to help the people out
[SPEAKER_00]: but you need a good germination rate so
test these seeds germ them out then see
[SPEAKER_00]: how they grow veg them take notes as they
veg if you've got 10 of them you should
[SPEAKER_00]: label them however you want you can name
them you can number them you can letter
[SPEAKER_00]: them but just make notes write that plant
number one grows like shit plant number
[SPEAKER_00]: two grows amazing plant number three it's
kind of weird plant number four is the one
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep already make notes because
you're not gonna remember this is gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: a long process and you're so excited all
your mental notes are gonna get foggy so
[SPEAKER_00]: make a lot of notes grow these out you can
grow them as big as you want you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them as small as you want but flower them
out do your testing process however you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to test them do you want to grow them
big and top them and spread them out see
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do I like to run kind of a
scientific test I run them once again in a
[SPEAKER_00]: six inch net pot untopped veg them for
about two or three weeks get them big
[SPEAKER_00]: enough just to see the shape of the plant
then put it into flower then I'll find out
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly if those plants show intersex
traits if they're mutants if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: weirdos I can find what they smell taste
look like I can find production very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly I can achieve production very
quickly and find winners and losers very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly in less than a hundred days if I
do it by just flowering them out really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly then you could dry them cure them
smoke them with the crew take a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and see what you've got it's
about a hundred day process maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and twenty if you veg them for too
long so grow them out see what you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to go bigger you can I like a
small test grow it just makes more sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to me why grow big-ass plants I don't even
take a clone a lot of times on my test
[SPEAKER_00]: grows I've got a thousand seeds grown out
ten of them if I find something cool in
[SPEAKER_00]: there I'll grow more seeds of that but
just grow them out find what we've got why
[SPEAKER_00]: do I want to spend a bunch of time growing
something that could be trash it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing but it also could be trash and if
I waste soil time electricity nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: water real estate in the grow on plants
that were shit then that's frustrating so
[SPEAKER_00]: veg them flower them out see what we've
got smoke them yourself smoke them with
[SPEAKER_00]: your friends smoke them with if you're a
medical grower smoke them with whoever is
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming them medically if you are a
profit grower smoke them with your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite customers give them to them as a
sample be like here's numbers one two and
[SPEAKER_00]: three let me know what you liked better
and they're gonna love you for that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: but you let me get you let me pick which
one you're gonna grow and they'll think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's custom for them and shit so select
the best ones the best one I don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: the word ones select it's one plural it's
weird select the best one or the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that work the best for you then continue
to grow those those all right my face is
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing out so at this point you've grown
out a bunch of the plants you found males
[SPEAKER_00]: females you know how many males and
females come out of a pack you know your
[SPEAKER_00]: germination rate you know what kind of
turps you're getting from each cross you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see now what that male did to each
cross did it over dominate everything did
[SPEAKER_00]: it add a nice something to everything did
it work the way that you expected it we
[SPEAKER_00]: said start this with a goal did you meet a
goal did you exceed your goal did you
[SPEAKER_00]: forget about the goal did you do something
totally different that wasn't your goal
[SPEAKER_00]: but still amazing just document that and
then when you do it again you got some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of document some sort of record so
are the seeds you made better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents did you improve upon cannabis did
you improve upon the species if you paid
[SPEAKER_00]: money for these seeds would you be happy
with that is there a reason to grow these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds again was this just something you
would have done one time or do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep growing these because you probably
have a lot of them are you letting
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and your ego get in the way of
quality control did you fall in love with
[SPEAKER_00]: this breeding project you know how your
friend your friend the SoundCloud rapper
[SPEAKER_00]: thinks that every beat he makes is the
best beat ever but it's the same beat he's
[SPEAKER_00]: been making since eighth grade are you
doing that with your breeding are you
[SPEAKER_00]: saying this is the best shit ever bro but
it's really just the same beat you made in
[SPEAKER_00]: eighth grade just trying to relive it
because your ego is in the way and you
[SPEAKER_00]: really should just fucking delete that and
move on and try something new don't let
[SPEAKER_00]: your ego get in the way of your breeding
I've done it I've been super proud of shit
[SPEAKER_00]: and then been like but but but and then if
I catch myself saying but but then I
[SPEAKER_00]: already know that I just need to but but
just move on that shit ain't worth but but
[SPEAKER_00]: but move on there are so many plants to
work with so many male plants so many
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants you can make feminized
plants which will be a whole other podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: we do not have time for that rabbit hole
there's so many plants to play with why
[SPEAKER_00]: would you want to waste time with
something that isn't moving the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: species the plant the industry the
community forward why do you want to stall
[SPEAKER_00]: it out and stand still so if you're
breeding isn't perfect isn't amazing just
[SPEAKER_00]: abandon the project let's start over let's
do something different unless you find a
[SPEAKER_00]: trait in there that you really want to
isolate work with breed again you'll know
[SPEAKER_00]: it if you see it you'll know what I'm
talking about all right we got all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through this I think yeah I think so there
will be a couple of quick edits but I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we did a good breeding podcast this
should spark a lot of questions I really
