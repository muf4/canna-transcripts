that number Let's stay focused at this
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode 860 of the grow from
your heart podcast Once again in this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode, we're going to give away free

somebody recently asked Me a question on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said are those free seeds really
free?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three ways to win free seeds on
this podcast or three ways to acquire free
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds The first way to acquire free seeds
is to send me a grow question on the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: help tab on my website I have a website
that website is I read genetics comm at
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tab It says grow help or grow
questions click on that tab Send me a
[SPEAKER_01]: question if it's a good question and I
read it here on the show I will send you a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds at I
read direct comm That is one way to win a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of seeds Another way to get a
free pack of seeds is every time you buy
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds at I read direct comm If you spend
more than $30 you get a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spend $100 you get another free
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds do stack those bonuses happen
at thirty one hundred two hundred and
[SPEAKER_01]: three hundred dollars So the more you buy
the more freebies you do get there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: page at I redirected that shows you all of
the freebies For your purchases those have
[SPEAKER_01]: recently been updated by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check it out So those are two ways
to get freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third way to get free seeds is to join
the patreon server That's right If you
[SPEAKER_01]: join the patreon server at the right level
every month You will receive a coupon code
[SPEAKER_01]: for free seeds if you join at the right
coupon code level You will get a coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: code for two packs of free seeds You'll
get two individual coupon codes each one
[SPEAKER_01]: available for one pack of seeds just to be
clear It is two packs for the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: subscription.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is three ways to win free seeds
Now the question was do I have to pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, yes, I do make you pay for
free Pay for shipping full disclosure
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have to pay the ten dollar
shipping fee, but for free seeds You've
[SPEAKER_01]: already got free seeds ten bucks in
shipping shouldn't kill you I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do you a favor you do me a favor you cover
the shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should both be happy that way So there
are three ways to get those free seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that I talk about the first way Send me a
good grow question if I read it free seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: the second one make a purchase at I
redirect if it's over $30 free seeds the
[SPEAKER_01]: third way join the patreon server at the
right tier and guess what free seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we've covered the free seeds
portion of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about the discounted pricing
and inventory at I redirect Let's keep
[SPEAKER_01]: this show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to get choked up right at the
start of the show I'm not even gonna edit
[SPEAKER_01]: that out We're gonna keep going while we
are flowing If you watched the last
[SPEAKER_01]: episode that I put out that episode was
about upgrading your grow room Somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: sent me a wonderful question about using
items that were not grow room Specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: designed and using them in our grow
environments to improve our grow to better
[SPEAKER_01]: our grow I read a lot of good ideas on the
podcast and then I asked you guys for
[SPEAKER_01]: updates in the comment section You guys
did not let me down the audience sent me a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of great updates in the YouTube
comments So I don't want to waste a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: time These items I'm about to talk about
are things that we should use or could
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly or are recommended to use in our
grow spaces That are not specifically grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a long list and I want to make a
short podcast So let me keep this rambly
[SPEAKER_01]: energy going and we're gonna jump right
into it before I go Please do click like
[SPEAKER_01]: and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make that part short the first thing
that we should have in our grow I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know why I didn't think about this because
I walk past mine every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trip over the little hose I stumble over
it all the time It's always in the
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking way because you always need it
and then it needs to be somewhere else
[SPEAKER_01]: real soon It never has a real home But
what I'm talking about is the shop vac
[SPEAKER_01]: dude to have a shop vac for the grow a wet
dry vac a shop vac That will help you a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot Also, if you spill a lot of water and
you don't have that water sensor I talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about get yourself a good squeegee learn
how to squeegee Water into the little
[SPEAKER_01]: trash can that you can flip over and then
pick it up You know what I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: because it may come right next to the
squeegee learn that technique So a shop
[SPEAKER_01]: vac and a squeegee in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things I definitely recommend
Also a little small dirt devil or a dust
[SPEAKER_01]: buster those little plug-in a little tiny
handheld vacuums You could charge it with
[SPEAKER_01]: the USB comes unplugged go clean the
corners of the grow space with that
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever sent me that idea very good
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that one a lot also when shipping
It builds up in the corners and you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: shop vac it out air duster that bad bitch
Blow some air into there move it out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the corner then shop vac it or sweep it if
you can But sometimes I get it there's
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the way So that little air
duster that will help you out got a hair
[SPEAKER_01]: right here my face tickling me Let's keep
on moving air duster is a good idea get
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff out of the corner Also,
you can air dust off a lot of your fans
[SPEAKER_01]: and blowers that shit does need to be
cleaned So the air duster works great for
[SPEAKER_01]: that then shop vac that bitch off after
you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um a really simple idea that often Gets
overlooked is using a pot as a riser if
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants are a little too short Or if
one plant is shorter than the rest you can
[SPEAKER_01]: flip another pot upside down You've
probably already got an extra nursery pot
[SPEAKER_01]: use that as a riser for the plants that
are too short also another great
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation that came from the YouTube
comments is a big our feed trough as a
[SPEAKER_01]: Reservoir if you've got a big batch of
plants that you want a lot of water for
[SPEAKER_01]: you Don't want to spend a lot of money
some of those big our feed troughs will
[SPEAKER_01]: qualify As a reservoir you do have to keep
them clean if you're growing on a budget
[SPEAKER_01]: anything will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great idea and There's probably
a big R near you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most places have a big R or some sort of
farm tractor supply sort of thing That's
[SPEAKER_01]: where you go get those sort of troughs
those the smaller the area the more likely
[SPEAKER_01]: to have one of those to be honest with you
So if you don't have a grow store around
[SPEAKER_01]: you that may be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a journal I don't care if it's a
paper journal a digital journal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I recommend a way to keep Notes,
I'm apologizing once again for the throat
[SPEAKER_01]: clearing I did of course take some dabs
before the podcast here But a journal also
[SPEAKER_01]: a thing on a pen to go with the journal
another thing I recommend is a dry erase
[SPEAKER_01]: board I've got a dry erase board by my
nutrients and I write down what I fed last
[SPEAKER_01]: time I write down what I sprayed last time
I write down my ideas if I think oh I
[SPEAKER_01]: should feed it this and that plant in the
back There's got a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should spray for that I write all that
down just to have some sort of thought
[SPEAKER_01]: process because I'm gonna leave the grow
and I'm gonna go smoke I'm gonna go do my
[SPEAKER_01]: normal day I'm gonna come back in 12 hours
and go when the fuck was going on in here
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a little map a little note on a dry
erase board that definitely helps You can
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a decently priced decently sized dry
erase board at a lot of places in town
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe at that big the same big R.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe at Costco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you got a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite spot If you got to go
to Walmart, there's one there,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, but a dry erase board It's a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also some sharpies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want to label some shit You
don't want the label coming off of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sharpie is always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, something That I like are my name is
stickers Like if you're going to a meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: you buy those little tags that says hi My
name is and everyone just went slim shady
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're my age You just said slim shady
when I said that but the stickers they say
[SPEAKER_01]: hi My name is then you can put the name of
your plant on there and slap that on your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant pot Now, you know which plant you've
got growing right there Those little tags
[SPEAKER_01]: are affordable very easy to find a lot of
other people will use white duct tape for
[SPEAKER_01]: that You could write the plant label on
white duct tape slap it on then somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: else recommended using painters tape So
you could just peel that tape right off
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're done reuse that pot not have
any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are quality ideas Another
thing I'm going to recommend is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: us right now It's winter time here in
Colorado when I fill my buckets with water
[SPEAKER_01]: in some areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too cold I need to put a I put an
aquarium heater in that five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: to heat up the water to get it to
temperature so if your water is too cold
[SPEAKER_01]: an aquarium heater may work if You're by
one of those big R's by one of those big
[SPEAKER_01]: like outdoor stores the farm store a Horse
trough feed heater is basically the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and it will do the same idea for you
It'll keep that water from freezing from
[SPEAKER_01]: being so cold That way the horsies can
drink also makes it warm enough for your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to be watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people recommending
Homemade clone machines like an easy
[SPEAKER_01]: cloner a turbo cloner There are many ways
to make those you can make it out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler out of a tote out of a bucket Lots
of recommendations on how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you can find a lot of ideas
online, but you can save a lot of money By
[SPEAKER_01]: making your own easy cloner and they're
awesome You still got to buy the clone
[SPEAKER_01]: collars if you have an alternative to the
collars send me your recommendation I have
[SPEAKER_01]: a long list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to go faster you guys multiple
people recommended knee pads So knee pads
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're down on your knees a lot in the
grow knee pads may be the thing for you I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get on my knees a lot because it's
hard for me to get back up But knee pads
[SPEAKER_01]: are not for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about velcro cord organizers if you
buy stuff from AC infinity A lot of times
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes with a little bundle of cord
organizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are awesome if you can get
those also, if you don't want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me, once again, if you don't want
to use the Velcro version they sell little
[SPEAKER_01]: they're actually paper clips is what they
are But not the folded bent kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind you squeeze them and it's like a
they're for putting legal documents
[SPEAKER_01]: together It's more fancy than a paper clip
like a high grade paper clip You squeeze
[SPEAKER_01]: it it folds open you stick your cords in
there Let it go and it will secure all of
[SPEAKER_01]: your cords.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is another wonderful idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also Somebody recommended condiment
bottles like little ketchup mustard
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles the little squeezy kind for
watering your small Seedlings that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: brilliant idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great one Somebody also
recommended using a dryer sheet to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: your scissors I haven't tried that but I
see visually and understand how that will
[SPEAKER_01]: work You got that coarse texture with the
dryer sheet stuff in there when you start
[SPEAKER_01]: rubbing scissors It'll definitely help
remove the sticky the goo the resin the
[SPEAKER_01]: junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great freaking idea also if you
Put those in your ducts and your vents in
[SPEAKER_01]: your house It'll make it smell fresh and
the neighbors won't smell the ganja as
[SPEAKER_01]: much if it's me, they're gonna smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of other great stuff to cover
here several people recommended using Pool
[SPEAKER_01]: pH testing strips instead of just a pH
meter an expensive meter They recommend a
[SPEAKER_01]: pool testing strip for a backup that way
we could double check the accuracy of our
[SPEAKER_01]: pH pin Occasionally calibrate that bad
dog, but then also once in a while pull
[SPEAKER_01]: out the Pool strips and see if they match
up because those things will always be
[SPEAKER_01]: correct The battery can't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't go out of gauge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't go out of what's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Calibration it will always be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So use those little drops to second guess
or to second check double check yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna clear my throat real hard not
gonna edit this episode gonna move away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the mic Excuse me, then we'll keep
going All right Thank you for that moment
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple people recommended Home Depot
racks or cheap shelving for clone storage
[SPEAKER_01]: and spaces I really like that That's kind
of what I do if you've got a lot of clones
[SPEAKER_01]: in a commercial facility You can line them
up on those racks put a light up there put
[SPEAKER_01]: more up there hang a light from the top
Lots of availability for space with those
[SPEAKER_01]: small racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to keep track of where I am on
these notes here We are plant ties and
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe cleaners a lot of people were anti
zip tie When I said to you zip ties people
[SPEAKER_01]: like and zip ties are bad because you got
to cut them off When I put them there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them there semi-permanently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not worried about cutting them off,
but you're correct They do have to be cut
[SPEAKER_01]: off later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people Said to use like plant ties
little bread ties twisty ties and I
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend a long time ago I was buying
those little pipe cleaners and using those
[SPEAKER_01]: to tie down plants to just a fasten shit
together They work for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anywhere you use a zip tie,
you could use a plant fastener or a Pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea Then one big
recommendation that I can't believe I
[SPEAKER_01]: skipped over was a paint sprayer That's
how I apply pesticides in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought a gray coast paint sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 400 bucks and I can spray a
hundred by hundred foot Grow space in no
[SPEAKER_01]: time get in there and douse every single
plant individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a paint sprayer is a good idea This is
a grow room related device, but I recently
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased the small pump sprayer It's not
I thought it was a pump sprayer from AC
[SPEAKER_01]: infinity turns out it's electric Boogie
oogie oogie, but I just push a little
[SPEAKER_01]: button and my fucking sprayer sprays my
plants for me I've got to carry it around
[SPEAKER_01]: but how bougie how fancy I did not realize
it was electric Until I got to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I got this new sprayer from AC
infinity also Probably by the next
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have an announcement for you with
AC infinity I don't want to make any
[SPEAKER_01]: promises because I don't know how long it
will take for them to activate my coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: code But I'm sure you see where this is
going by the next episode or try it now
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see go to AC infinity and use coupon
code.
[SPEAKER_01]: I re and you'll get 10% off your order by
using coupon code I re with our friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: AC infinity That's the official
announcement right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk more about it when I'm Certain
that the code works if it doesn't work be
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you it's a holiday weekend I
don't know if they have activated the code
[SPEAKER_01]: yet, but it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned Big shout out to my friends
at AC infinity for linking up with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, where were we the little sprayer?
[SPEAKER_01]: The little sprayer was great the next
recommendation I can't believe I glazed
[SPEAKER_01]: over this in my last episode little turkey
pans you guys can buy turkey pans Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably sold the fuck out next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turkey pans will be restocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go get turkey pans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't good For trim bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't good for sorting seeds and
they work really good also for underneath
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot if you overwater You need a saucer
want some more for the water to go set
[SPEAKER_01]: that bad bitch right in a turkey pan So
you can it's got multiple uses once you
[SPEAKER_01]: use it for the drainage Don't trim weed
into it again, but you could trim over it
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get seeds out of it very useful
device that cheap turkey pan I talked a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute ago about the paint sprayer How
about a cheap deck sprayer or just a pump
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayer for your pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get those on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it all year Your hardware
shops they are affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the kind with a pressure release
valve Once you pump it up to get it real
[SPEAKER_01]: nice and tight to spray Now you've sprayed
what you need to you need to take off that
[SPEAKER_01]: top and refill it or dump it out If you
don't have a pressure release when you
[SPEAKER_01]: twist that shit off all the pressure comes
out of that one spot into your eye
[SPEAKER_01]: Inevitably, so find the kind with the
pressure release.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I highly recommend I'm doing a
lot of things very highly today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we got turkey pans on the list twice I
must have really meant that um this one
[SPEAKER_01]: Will sound weird at the beginning,
but hear me out, bro I recommend some
[SPEAKER_01]: pantyhose or nylon stockings over the end
of ducting That will help you keep out
[SPEAKER_01]: small bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help you keep out debris leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever I've got a duct that runs to the
outside over that is a piece of pantyhose
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually about six inches up so that
it doesn't get destroyed right away But if
[SPEAKER_01]: anything was to go up or in through that
duct, hopefully that pantyhose is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a barrier It doesn't stop the
airflow, but it will stop a spider
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully Maybe maybe it'll deter a mouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but it's a good idea put a
little pantyhose on there It'll help you
[SPEAKER_01]: get some dust not in the grow space little
prevention will be good for you They do
[SPEAKER_01]: sell expensive versions of that there are
actually carbon filters that can go on the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of your ducting Those are great as
well But I'm trying to tell you non grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room related things and that is a very
grow room related device In the last
[SPEAKER_01]: episode I did mention that I like to use a
fire alarm a fire device a smoke detector
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the word I'm fucking stumbling over I
like to have one of those to let me know
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's a fire But then I said it
doesn't hook up to my phone But then a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people several people your freaking
tech geniuses reminded me that my wise
[SPEAKER_01]: cameras do have a fire alarm Detector that
will then notify me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll say hey, this thing's been fucking
beeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something is beeping It doesn't know
exactly but it will know you can set that
[SPEAKER_01]: in your settings So go tinker with your
settings your wise cameras will let you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Let me read the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said Ross to Jeff you mentioned phone
notifications for smoke detectors just to
[SPEAKER_01]: let you know the wise camera has a setting
under sound Detection to notify you of
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke detector noises and it works pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you I'm glad you mentioned that I'm
gonna go tinker with that and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that works for me The next thing I'm gonna
write down or that I did write down is a
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanic crawler for moving around heavy
things It could be I get the the big five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon bottle of Ruby from new millennium
and that bad bitch is heavy bro moving
[SPEAKER_01]: From one spot to the other with the shitty
handle on there I put that on the mechanic
[SPEAKER_01]: crawler cart set it on there Push that bad
bitch right to where it needs to be and
[SPEAKER_01]: then also you could put a big plant on
there if you need to move it It's useful
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it the skateboard around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the skateboard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the stick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the mechanic crawler the little
four-way roller thing We move a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit with that something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a staple gun, bro I use a staple
gun for so many things if the white panda
[SPEAKER_01]: film comes down tech tech tech just put
that bad bitch back up I've made rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: with a staple gun and panda film.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like my bedroom is real fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all built with panda film So yeah,
it's really not that snazzy panda film and
[SPEAKER_01]: a staple gun will get you a long way and a
grow environment What do I mean by panda
[SPEAKER_01]: film that white poly film?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's black on one side white on the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they call it panda It's panda
black and white and it's you can get in
[SPEAKER_01]: different thicknesses Like six mil is
probably the most common maybe three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it as flooring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could build walls with it It's really
easy to wipe down that white color is
[SPEAKER_01]: great for A grow panda film, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got a fucking free ad from me
use that shit in your grows It's way
[SPEAKER_01]: better than mylar mylar sucks in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about that in the future
Did I mention aquarium pumps for mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: teas and for stirring your hydroponic
tank?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a hydro tank with nutrients in
there You don't want them sitting still go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the aquarium store get a fish tank pump
put that shit in there or point it
[SPEAKER_01]: sideways It'll stir your fucking hydro
tank all day long for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go big fucking tips right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed I lost my Spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh did I mention a heat and a VPD gun?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use a heat gun to point at my
leaves and see what the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is Not to be a shill but our
friends at AC infinity sell a leaf surface
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and VPD gun That is a great
Christmas gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go grab one of those for yourself or
your grower loved one Somebody else said a
[SPEAKER_01]: generator is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking expensive But yes,
if you can afford a generator,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you live in a low populated
area to be honest with you I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle with The word rural but if you
live in a rural area, you may want a
[SPEAKER_01]: generator if you live somewhere that runs
out of power frequently if the power goes
[SPEAKER_01]: out if you got bad connections if the snow
comes and it's gonna be buck cheeks cold a
[SPEAKER_01]: Generator will help out the whole house
and help save the grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get a generator somebody else
recommended also a tape measure Why didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of that bro a real tape measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're measuring a lot of shit and the girl
how much panda film do I need to cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: How far apart of the lights how far from
the canopy to the lights are?
[SPEAKER_01]: As much space is in there lots of shit
very useful with a tape measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandpa said major So a tape measure
but get a tape measure a good one you
[SPEAKER_01]: construction guys out there argue in the
comments What the good brand is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a construction dude, but I know
we're not supposed to buy Milwaukee So
[SPEAKER_01]: link us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm another very important thing to think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is very important I can't believe
I didn't mention this a first aid kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want shit to go wrong in your grow
I really don't but have a First-aid kit,
[SPEAKER_01]: what if you cut yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I don't I'm not even gonna make
you know What could go wrong a lot of shit
[SPEAKER_01]: could go terrible have a first-aid kit
burns scrapes cuts bruises ouchies be
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared for all of it another thing you
may want is an eye wash station just a
[SPEAKER_01]: squeezy eye wash thing to get fluid into
your eyes and get fucking Whatever your
[SPEAKER_01]: sprain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what fucking I was gonna
say a bloom booster But I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: go with a specific product But get the the
bloom boosters when you're mixing and you
[SPEAKER_01]: splashed it get that shit out of your eye
with a little eye Rinse station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another thing that is just a random
og piece of advice I have a friend who
[SPEAKER_01]: lived in a non-legal state and allegedly
he was cultivating cannabis One day he
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped something and it splashed you into
into his eyeballs He was unable to call
[SPEAKER_01]: 911 for help because he was growing weed
and in a legal environment He basically
[SPEAKER_01]: had to call emergency services to his
house to come help him.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he did was he used Siri I don't want
to say what he did because I've got Siri
[SPEAKER_01]: on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told Siri To call his wife and Siri
called his wife and he just yelled into
[SPEAKER_01]: the phone babe come home Help me and
finally she caught on because she couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: hear him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phone was over there He had to yell
until she fucking caught on she came home
[SPEAKER_01]: and helped him out But have a plan like
that put somebody's name in your phone
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can call and trust and have a
plan with them Say hey, bro I got you in
[SPEAKER_01]: my phone as like fucking emergency number
two so that if something goes wrong I can
[SPEAKER_01]: call you and you can come to my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe leave a key somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give the homie a key Maybe I have a backup
key so they don't have to kick in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking door Have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want anything to go wrong But
strategy is thinking about it planning for
[SPEAKER_01]: it now is way better than going I got pH
down in my eye What do I do looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: your phone being fucking blind stumbling
over?
[SPEAKER_01]: just tell Siri to call your friend that
you need to help you and Siri will do that
[SPEAKER_01]: for you and it could save you a whole lot
of Headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a piece of og advice My phone
really keeps trying to do all the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was telling Siri to do I had to
turn it off a couple times Sorry for the
[SPEAKER_01]: quick glitchy edit there All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've covered all of the super
important things on the updated list of
[SPEAKER_01]: really Good ideas of things to have in
your grow space and things that can make
[SPEAKER_01]: growing better and easier I've got one
more thing that I found very entertaining
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you will laugh at this a lot of
you think that it's really funny a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: you Especially if you've ever worked in a
commercial cultivation facility will know
[SPEAKER_01]: how freaking serious this one is.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a coffee maker, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't drink coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a coffee guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me a spaz I've already got this
energy after 22 dabs you don't want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: me drink coffee, but I worked with a bunch
of dudes and The night before we would
[SPEAKER_01]: leave They would brew a pot of coffee and
let that shit sit overnight and then use
[SPEAKER_01]: that as the water for the next pot of
coffee Because they could not get enough
[SPEAKER_01]: caffeine and enough coffee coffee coffee
But they kicked ass all day a work for it
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of you folks out there may need
that coffee maker Whatever kind of coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: maker it is do your thing pimp and get
that shit right outside the grow get it
[SPEAKER_01]: set up so that you could have the energy
