[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 92 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, The Comey Rocks to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everyone's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everyone's having a good Monday or
whatever day it is when you're listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking on some dabs of some amnesia
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are smoking something delicious
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have had a great couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read a few news articles here
today, but first, I want to ramble about a
[SPEAKER_00]: few things that I have gotten to do this
past couple of weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to come out way
after this, but the movie Straight Outta
[SPEAKER_00]: Compton recently came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you guys don't know that I
actually grew up in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up at the intersection of Belfour
Boulevard and Compton Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blocks away from the actual city of
Compton.
[SPEAKER_00]: NWA used to come do record signings and
appearances at a record store about a
[SPEAKER_00]: block away from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was 10 years old, I actually met
Eazy-E and the whole NWA crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Ice Cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Snoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met MC Rand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Dr. Dre.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another guy with them called
himself DJ Speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yella was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a few more guys there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little kid, but I do remember that
their album was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already had the Straight Outta
Compton CD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was singing Fuck the Police all day
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like 10 years old walking around my
neighborhood singing Fuck the Police and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dope Man, but when they showed up to the
record store, I remember the management of
[SPEAKER_00]: the record store looking pissed off
because they were stupid high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in NWA showed up for that record
signing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smelling like they just smoked a blunt in
Eazy-E's van.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing the movie Straight Outta Compton
was very reminiscent for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me back to my old neighborhood in
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me back to those times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brought me back to a lot of memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movie was freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give that five golden pot leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend the movie Straight Outta
Compton to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that played the manager,
Paul Giamani, I think his name is,
[SPEAKER_00]: he did a hell of a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the actors did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually used Ice Cube's son to play
Cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell of a good movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you guys go see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably already seen it by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't, go see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one really comedic line in the
movie that made me laugh my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my best parts,
my favorite parts of the movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole scene was actually one of my
favorite parts of the movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the beginning of that scene until the
joke that ends the scene, that was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I did notice, I don't remember
which character it was, but the manager
[SPEAKER_00]: character, Paul Giamani's character,
the manager, he plays a guy named Jerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the rappers were having a private
conversation over a meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They completely repeated a section of
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed weird to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like a bad editing job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being somebody that edits podcasts and
shit, I felt that the repetition of that
[SPEAKER_00]: dialogue was a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like this to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do what I felt like I saw on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manager said, so we can't continue
like this because we're going to go broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other guy replied, well, yeah,
but this is how we fucking live because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gangsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the manager said, but we can't
continue to live like this because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other guy said, yeah, but that's how
we live because we're fucking gangsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the movie kept going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at my date and I was like,
did they just repeat some shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't feel right in the movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, that was the only flaw I
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Straight Outta Compton movie gets five
golden pot leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to my next little chicken
scratch on this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, this Saturday or last Saturday
it would be, I was invited to the High
[SPEAKER_00]: Plains Comedy Fest in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The High Plains Comedy Fest is a comedy
festival, of course, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the shows throughout different
clubs in the Denver, Colorado area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the performances were at the High
Dive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the performances were at Mutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the performances were at Three
Kings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then later on at night, performers were
headlining at places like the Paramount
[SPEAKER_00]: Theater and ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was invited by my friend Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Baker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast,
but if you do, big shout out, much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baker is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is linked up with the comedy world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Baker's fault that I have gotten to
smoke weed and hash with some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm not going to name drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke hash and weed with a lot of
my favorite comedians, people that you
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to, people that have podcasts,
that we listen to their podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was standing on Broadway in Denver,
just smoking joints and bowls with
[SPEAKER_00]: world-class comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all treating me like I was one
of them, and it's mostly Baker's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also because I had the good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the High Plains Comedy
Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a wonderful freaking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout out to our friends at
Grassroots California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the Grassroots store had to
close their doors, but they had an awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to go in there and grab several
Grassroots hats for the price of two,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I am styled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that's enough catching
up and humble bragging about what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten to do for the past couple of
weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Fish is coming up here on the
next weekend, so you guys will get to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and get into some of the
news articles that I have pulled up for
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been following the show,
you will remember that recently there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a raid in California of a dispensary,
and when the police raided this
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, first of all, they treated all
of the people inside of the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: like complete shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were completely disrespectful to a
woman in a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they cleared out the dispensary and
proceeded to destroy this dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they did not realize that they were on
a hidden camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they destroyed the dispensary,
they destroyed displays, they destroyed
[SPEAKER_00]: the security systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just tore this place apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they were doing this, they were caught
on camera eating edibles from the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawyer for the dispensary found the
tape, edited the tape, and it was put up
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all over the internet, but also
they were trying to file a case against
[SPEAKER_00]: the law enforcement officials that were
responsible for this raid and for the
[SPEAKER_00]: eating of the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the video was introduced and a court
case was presented, the Santa Ana police
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to stop this footage from being used
in a raid because they were under the
[SPEAKER_00]: presumption of
[SPEAKER_00]: being used as evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The subheadline is, and I think that this
is great news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and read the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from Los Angeles, and it says,
An Orange County Superior Court judge
[SPEAKER_00]: ruled Wednesday that a controversial
surveillance video allegedly showing three
[SPEAKER_00]: police officers eating marijuana-infused
candy and mocking a disabled woman during
[SPEAKER_00]: a May dispensary raid can be used in an
internal investigation by the Santa Ana
[SPEAKER_00]: Police Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unidentified officers and their union,
the Santa Ana Police Officers Association,
[SPEAKER_00]: filed a temporary restraining order
earlier this month to block the video from
[SPEAKER_00]: being used in an ongoing internal
investigation for the officer's conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: during the raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police argued their privacy was
violated when surveillance cameras
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded them from inside Sky High
Holistic Medical Marijuana Dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: after they thought they had disabled all
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Superior Court Judge Ronald Bauer rejected
that notion on Wednesday, the Orange
[SPEAKER_00]: County Register first reported,
saying that the officers had no
[SPEAKER_00]: objectively reasonable expectation that
their actions and words during the raid
[SPEAKER_00]: would not be observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The officers should not expect privacy on
their on-duty performance of an official
[SPEAKER_00]: function at a marijuana dispensary,
Bauer ruled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have made no claim that their work
required secrecy or that it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: impeded by public view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matthew Pappas, the dispensary's attorney,
said the ruling is a critical victory for
[SPEAKER_00]: holding police and public officials
accountable for their actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ruling shows that the court had the
courage to say no to a very powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: police officer reunion and stand up for
the rights of people who had bad things
[SPEAKER_00]: like this happen, Pappas told the
Huffington Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pappas released edited footage of the May
27th raid in June that was published by
[SPEAKER_00]: various local news outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edited video, which can be seen on
YouTube, it's also here in this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to see it, go to the
huffingtonpost.com, type in, let's see,
[SPEAKER_00]: where will you find it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just type in marijuana raid, and I'm sure
you will find this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to find where I was now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edited video, which can be seen,
shows officers busting down the door and
[SPEAKER_00]: ordering everyone on the ground at
gunpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which that's where the whole comedy
starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're battering, using a battering ram
to pound in this door, and the funny part
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the business was open.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they had to do was turn the handle and
pull, and they could have gotten in very
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead they used a battering ram and
pushed really hard instead of just gently
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says the footage, according to
Pappas, shows police unsuccessfully
[SPEAKER_00]: disabling the shop surveillance cameras,
which go on to record the officers playing
[SPEAKER_00]: darts, eating something which he argues is
marijuana infused food, and making a joke
[SPEAKER_00]: about an amputee who uses a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you punch that one-legged old Bonita,
one officer asks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to kick her in her fucking
nub, a female officer replies to laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corey Glaive, the attorney representing
the officers and their union, argued that
[SPEAKER_00]: the video was edited to distort the
officer's behavior during the raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He previously told the Huff Post that at
least one officer voluntarily took and
[SPEAKER_00]: passed a drug test, the results of which
were provided to the SAPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pappas denied the video was doctored.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full video is more than 12 hours long,
he said, so he released edited versions
[SPEAKER_00]: with subtitles to show what officers were
allegedly saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire video has been made available
to the police department, and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have seen the full unaltered version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and that they have seen the full
unaltered version, Pappas said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky High Holistic has filed a
multi-million dollar lawsuit against the
[SPEAKER_00]: police department, alleging that the
officers used excessive force during the
[SPEAKER_00]: raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary is also seeking the return
of its property seized during the raid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes marijuana, cannabis infused
edibles, and thousands of dollars in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hearing regarding the return of the
seized property is scheduled for Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glaive and the SAPD did not immediately
respond to requests for comment following
[SPEAKER_00]: the judge's ruling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like the ruling has been made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, the ruling has been made that the
video will be usable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will research the hearing regarding the
return of the seized property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna make a note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it takes me a minute to write
legibly, but I'd rather take a break and
[SPEAKER_00]: write it so that I remember to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so they will be able to use
this video in court, which is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: thing because if you or I were arrested
and there was a video of whatever we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, that video would be used against us
in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we say and or do will be used
against us in a court of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if we think that we have some
sort of assumption of privacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to give us any privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Brother is watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on camera somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just glad that they're gonna use
this video because I think it's fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: that these cops can act like they're
trying to do something just and useful for
[SPEAKER_00]: us and then just go in and be thugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were gangsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went in there and fucking stole and
destroyed shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were vandals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be held accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do some research on what
happened to the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they get their cannabis back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they get their money back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they get their edibles back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they make that cop pay for the
edible that he bought and ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I hope they also sue the fuck out
of them for all the wages they've lost and
[SPEAKER_00]: the mental anguish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this comes back to bite this police
force in their asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from the beautiful city of
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Facebook has been bustling about
the city of Pueblo, Colorado and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a fact today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can't say that it's a fact,
but I've seen this in more than one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen and read that Pueblo,
Colorado now produces the most legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis of anywhere on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce more legal cannabis than
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now the new golden triangle here in
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our rules are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are affordable here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate is perfect for growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody is moving here to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is coming to Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from what I've seen on Facebook and on
the internet here, Pueblo, Colorado has
[SPEAKER_00]: become the new emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce more cannabis than anywhere
else in the world, or at least the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this news article,
let me try that again, because I stumbled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This news article comes from High Country
News.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the headline is the Silicon Valley of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local officials want Pueblo County,
Colorado to be the best place to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not everyone is high on the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is written by a guy named
Joel Warner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will read it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this is great because it starts
off with a picture of the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lady says, Tammy White,
age 52, shows her son and his friend the
[SPEAKER_00]: product she bought at the spot 420 in
Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drove from Florida for the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tammy, who has chronic back pain from
bone spurs, could buy and smoke pot
[SPEAKER_00]: legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great pictures in this
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna scroll through the pictures
right quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are any more from Pueblo,
I will share them with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A Pueblo resident who moved from Maryland
to work in the industry smokes pot while
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooking the marijuana plants he grows
in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was hired at a greenhouse five days
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a picture of some guy's
mediocre pot grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy's growing some mediocre pot
in his backyard, and his backyard's a
[SPEAKER_00]: mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we'll keep looking through
these pictures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this guy's in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, to put his full name,
Bill Rader, age 60, carries his favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana plant outside to soak up the sun
in Pueblo West campground, where he has
[SPEAKER_00]: been living for two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rader, a veteran from Missouri who smokes
because he can't take pain pills,
[SPEAKER_00]: is one among many people who have moved to
Pueblo from out of state to take advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude's living in a mobile home,
and he just has pot plants sitting right
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the mobile home here, and he lives
in a RV park.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's the Openn vape rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that guy from the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Ortiz waters plants at Los Suyenos,
an outdoor marijuana farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a dude just watering a bunch of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some great pictures in this
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you guys reading this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great shop of mine, or a great
photo of my shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Verna, age 25, the grower at the
spot, 420, turns the lights on in a newly
[SPEAKER_00]: constructed grow showroom where marijuana
will be cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visitors will be able to tour the
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you go to highcountrynews.com
and you look at the article, the Silicon
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley of Marijuana, there is an actual
photograph of the shop where I work,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow room in which I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in this article, so I encourage you
to go take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Morley looks out over 30 acres he
owns east of Pueblo, Colorado and imagines
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this blustery May afternoon,
there's little more than mud and puddles
[SPEAKER_00]: here, bordered by highway and railroad
tracks and flanked by farm buildings and
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the end of September, if all goes
well, he'll be looking at a pungent green
[SPEAKER_00]: thicket as 14,400 marijuana plants reach
their full eight-foot height.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of several major outdoor grows
launching this summer in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, Morley plans to expand into
another 15,000 acres investing in center
[SPEAKER_00]: pivot irrigation, greenhouses and
processing facilities able to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: 40,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morley, age 55 and dressed in jeans,
flannel shirt and a tiger's baseball cap,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a major Colorado Springs real estate
developer.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a marijuana dispensary opened in one
of his buildings, he realized how
[SPEAKER_00]: lucrative the business could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, he wondered, am I not doing this
myself?
[SPEAKER_00]: If he planted corn on his land,
each acre would require approximately 2.2
[SPEAKER_00]: acres of water per year and produce $768
in annual sales, according to Rachel
[SPEAKER_00]: Zancanella, a Pueblo-based Colorado
Division of Water Resources engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same acre planted with marijuana
would require roughly 2.65 feet of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.65 acre feet of water, excuse me,
and gross, Morley, $6 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the big business of rural weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rural weed, I'm sorry, that's hard to
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since the local steel industry
collapsed in the 1980s, Pueblo County has
[SPEAKER_00]: been seeking an economic savior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly a third of its population is on
public assistance, and in 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: the metropolitan area around its eponymous
city had the highest unemployment rate in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Colorado voters passed Amendment 64
in 2012, paving the way for legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, the county commissioner saw a
chance for revival.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hired Brian Vicente, the Denver
lawyer who helped write the ballot
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative to craft rules for growing and
selling pot outside city limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, about 50 entities,
including Morley, are now licensed or
[SPEAKER_00]: conditionally approved to do so in the
county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, the biggest opponent of
marijuana reform has been the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: Vicente says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the tables have turned.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one else in history has taken as
comprehensive look at establishing
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana business laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo County's economy, he adds,
has gone through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, this is my town.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lived here since I was approximately
15 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've left a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been here for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen this town go from just a small
Poe town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little Poe Dunk Hick town when I
moved here, and then it turned into a city
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it got going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had some things happening and
people were buying houses and moving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at one point, everything stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like everything fell apart and
everybody went poor here, myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked shit jobs to get myself through,
you know, and then I grew weed on the side
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was the only way that I can
make ends meet was to grow some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've got this legal cannabis
industry, obviously I am doing great for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a legal job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to work and pay taxes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps our whole economy because
the people that were, I'm going to say 22
[SPEAKER_00]: to about 35 around here, there wasn't a
lot for us to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could either work at gas stations or we
could work at a telemarketing place or we
[SPEAKER_00]: could work crap jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with all of the cannabis industry that
has boomed up, myself and all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends are living very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us trim weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine out of 10 of my friends are involved
in the cannabis industry in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and none of us are hungry for anything
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got everything we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us have to be criminals anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to do anything shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to watch our backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to look over our shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to work nine to five or whatever we
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work eight hour, 10 hour days and you
come home from work and you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about hustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about being a drug
dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about the stupid
shit that comes along with an illegal pot
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great way to revive an
economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get benefits and health insurance and
pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't do that when you're
growing weed in the basement and selling
[SPEAKER_00]: it illegally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not part of the cogs of the
community that make a society work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eye of that society.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a black market drug dealer,
even though you spend all your money at
[SPEAKER_00]: all the restaurants and all the stores in
town, people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they don't freak out when I walk into
Applebee's and buy dinner for me and all
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends or wherever we go, go to Qdoba
and buy the whole crew dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look at you like dirty drug
dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at you like, oh, that man has a
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue on with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but the area's relationship with
pot means remains ambivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is after all a place where irate
voters recalled their state senator over
[SPEAKER_00]: new gun restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some worry that the county's latest growth
industry is bringing social problems along
[SPEAKER_00]: with money, and others doubt whether the
bold experiment will reap the promised
[SPEAKER_00]: rewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to the 1970s, Pueblo was known as P.U.
[SPEAKER_00]: Town because of the steel mill,
says Paula McPheeters, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo for Positive Impact, which opposes
the county's pot friendly laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting known for that again
because of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That group shows up at all this,
let's see, Pueblo for Positive Impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up at all of the city council
meetings and they try to fight down
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and the cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, guys, they don't do any
research and they don't know what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a few members that do support
cannabis would show up, we could shut
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys up every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, Mike is the only one that goes to
the meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to ask you guys to come to
city council meetings when they happen on
[SPEAKER_00]: Mondays and help us speak positively about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a hypocrite because I can't make it to
every meeting, but I do go and I do try to
[SPEAKER_00]: voice my opinion when I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the city of Pueblo is sometimes
called the Pittsburgh of the West.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like its steel town sister city back
east, its glory years lie in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call Center is one of the few active
industries dot its downtown area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo County Director of Economic
Development, Chris Markison, says that one
[SPEAKER_00]: of his predecessors used to drive
potential business owners down the east
[SPEAKER_00]: side's crumbling streets and past crack
houses and say enthusiastically,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll work for anything, hoping that the
promise of a cheap labor force would prove
[SPEAKER_00]: irresistible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amendment 64 gave local governments the
power to decide whether and how to permit
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational pot within their communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pueblo City Council, for example,
banned recreational pot shops and grows
[SPEAKER_00]: within city limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reacted similarly when medical
marijuana was legalized in 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: placing a moratorium on dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
Division's 2014 annual report says that
[SPEAKER_00]: 228 local jurisdictions have voted to
prohibit medical and retail marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo County, however, rolled out the
welcome mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana stores don't require a lot of
space, but indoor grow operations can,
[SPEAKER_00]: says Pueblo County Commissioner Terry
Hart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pueblo County got hit pretty hard on
the recession, so we had a lot of empty
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial buildings throughout the county
that realtors were trying desperately to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some other pot friendly communities,
the county made marijuana businesses a use
[SPEAKER_00]: by right in industrial and business
districts, meaning they weren't subject to
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes time consuming and arduous
special reviews or approvals by local
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Pueblo County offered something beyond
cheap real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike Denver, it had an abundance of
available agricultural land, so local
[SPEAKER_00]: officials made marijuana cultivation a use
by right here, right there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely the first Colorado County to do so,
according to Vicente and Joan Armstrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo County's planning director.
[SPEAKER_00]: The county had also issued pioneering
rules that prohibit hemp grows with male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from being located within five
miles of existing marijuana grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This prevents cross-pollination that could
lower the marijuana plant's THC content
[SPEAKER_00]: while increasing THC and hemp,
which can exceed 0.3% under state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does make sense, although they
kind of worded this weirdly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell they don't know what
they're talking about, but the city also
[SPEAKER_00]: issued rules saying that you cannot grow
hemp within five miles of a cannabis grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a great thing because like they
say here, it prevents cross-pollination,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're not too worried about getting
the cannabis into the hemp because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not growing male plants outside all of our
hemp growers are pro-growers and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten rid of the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only males you would find would be on
the hemp farms, and we don't need the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: farms fucking up the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says even the Pueblo Board of Water
Works, the local utility that leases water
[SPEAKER_00]: for businesses and agricultural use,
is trying to accommodate the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year when the Bureau of Reclamation
explicitly prohibited the use of federal
[SPEAKER_00]: water for pot cultivation, water board
employees calculated that they could lease
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 800 acre feet of raw water to
marijuana cultivators without running
[SPEAKER_00]: afoul of the feds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was completely new territory for us,
says resources manager Alan Ward,
[SPEAKER_00]: who notes 92 acre feet of the so-called
marijuana water was already under contract
[SPEAKER_00]: as of this May.
[SPEAKER_00]: When amendment 64 was first passed,
I didn't put much thought into how it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to affect my job, but for a few
months, it seemed like it was nearly all I
[SPEAKER_00]: was focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new rules are more than paying for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, the county netted $1.8 million
from licensing fees for pot establishments
[SPEAKER_00]: and marijuana sales taxes, covering the
cost of its virtual marijuana department
[SPEAKER_00]: and boosting its general fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since marijuana remains illegal at the
federal level, most banks are still cagey
[SPEAKER_00]: about allowing pot businesses as
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means county staff have gotten used
to pot owners plopping tens of thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars in cash on their desks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcuson says charter buses filled with
Wall Street investors have been touring
[SPEAKER_00]: local farmland, and there's talk of
branching Pueblo Grown Pot along the lines
[SPEAKER_00]: of Pueblo Green Chili, another celebrated
local crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real estate prices are rising too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial properties have nearly doubled
in price to $50 per square foot just since
[SPEAKER_00]: June of 2014, says local realtor Kendall
Curtis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that the first outdoor grows and
greenhouses are materializing,
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural land prices have doubled up
to $10,000 an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: All in all, the Southern Colorado Growers
Association, the local marijuana trade
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, claims the industry has
provided 1,300 new jobs and contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: more than $120 million to the local
economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I can list 25 people I know that
have jobs because of this boom in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and they all work at the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I can list 25 people that are
employed because of this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, and that is one shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are 14 or 16 shops just
in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of people that are
employed because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The county is also hoping to attract
marijuana testing labs and processing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo could be the Silicon Valley of
marijuana, says Marcuson, the county's
[SPEAKER_00]: economic development director.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd prefer that to becoming Napa Valley
to a, let me try that line again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd prefer that to becoming a Napa Valley
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The county wants to export its products,
not host busloads of marijuana tourists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Former Growers Association president Tommy
Jidone is a Pueblo native, restaurateur,
[SPEAKER_00]: and rodeo organizer who hosts an annual
country music festival east of the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: He opened a dispensary nearby,
but he doesn't smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 49 years old, he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they legalize it, I wasn't going to
be like, woohoo, I'm going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be a pothead just to
consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that Pueblo County wants to keep
a fairly low profile hasn't appeased the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry's critics though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana hearings are heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: County commissioners have received
threatening phone calls and growers
[SPEAKER_00]: worries that some zealot with a crop
duster could devastate the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our commissioners rushed headlong into
this without consulting the county
[SPEAKER_00]: residents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complaints Pueblo for positive impact
McFeeters, I guess that's the head of that
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allowed a glut of marijuana stores
and indoor grows to spring up in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: West, the unincorporated suburb where she
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I said, they're like 14 shops
out there and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have armed security guards.
[SPEAKER_00]: People pull into our parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk into our store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a purchase just like they would
at any other store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sandwich shop right down the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a saw and tool shop right down
the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: The San Isabel electric is right across
the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: People pull up in their car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk in and they do business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk back out to their car and they
drive away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing bad happens at our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to do something stupid at our
dispensary or security guard will walk
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and tell you to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see you smoking on the premises of
our dispensary, I will tell you to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rude about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't smoke here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you people just drive away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got somebody smoking in the back
while I was headed for my lunch break.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just drove away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't tolerate that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see why people are so wrapped up
and not having a dispensary around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth has come at a steep social
cost, McFeeters and other critics say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana related crimes, including the
2014 armed robbery of a marijuana shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: have increased, according to Under Sheriff
J.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, local affordable housing
organizations and shelters have been
[SPEAKER_00]: flooded with families who traveled here
hoping to find jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first four months of 2015 alone,
306 households relocated to Pueblo because
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana, says Ann Steadleman,
who directs a nonprofit housing assistance
[SPEAKER_00]: organization called Posada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not easy to get a good paying job in
the pot industry, Steadleman says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people can't pass the background
checks and other checks needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these people are saying that cannabis
is causing problems because there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: break in an armed robbery of a marijuana
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shit happens at gas stations and
liquor stores once a week around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody says shit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened to one dispensary and it's
fucking headline news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dismiss your one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many days in a year and so
many dispensaries that this one is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just shit that you expect in
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they say these 306 households
that relocated to Pueblo because of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, we didn't send you an
invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't ask them to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't bring them here without a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cannabis's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to move here without getting a
job first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to move here without getting
the proper paperwork to work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They moved here without knowing how to
trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not our fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cannabis's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's poor planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and the problems could have
repercussions far beyond Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: In February, a local couple filed a
lawsuit in U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: District Court claiming that the pot girl
next door devalued their property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of two lawsuits aimed at striking
down Colorado's system on the grounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: it conflicts with federal drug laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if the state laws stand, Pat Oglesby,
a tax attorney who studies marijuana at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Center for New Revenue in North
Carolina, isn't sure how much Pueblo's
[SPEAKER_00]: head start in the reefer race will
ultimately pay off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 2015 report he co-authored concluded
that roughly 20,000 acres of pot would
[SPEAKER_00]: supply the entire U.S.
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like they have a plan to really
have a huge amount of supply, while other
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions aren't licensing any
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see the county gaining a
short-term advantage and having a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: market share, says Oglesby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that is an advantage that can be
kept over time, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's saying, let's see, where did he
say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 20,000 acres of pot would supply the
entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how accurate that is,
you guys, because right now, there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: pot on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: The street has ran out of weed because
people don't want to go to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now in my area, there is usually
weed abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is usually some dank-ass herb on the
streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to sack a weed, it's not a
problem to get an ounce for somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 150 to 200 bucks for some fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, an ounce of weed is always 200
bucks if you can find a good ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking up all the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that 20,000 acres would
supply the entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: market because there are medical patients
that smoke a half ounce a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn it into concentrates or edibles,
and they'll consume a half ounce a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy may be underestimating this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going by just numbers that have been
gathered by polls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going by numbers that have been
gathered by social scientists or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those numbers are probably not
accurate because people aren't honest when
[SPEAKER_00]: people do polls and surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep reading you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, in the meantime, the tiny town of
Boone, population 339 in Eastern Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: County, seems grateful for the boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entrepreneurs Mark Morley and Jeff Ayode,
a food plant developer originally from the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast, stopped in Boone one afternoon
for lunch after comparing notes on their
[SPEAKER_00]: developing grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ayode bought a nearby 500 acre ranch where
he spent $6.6 million installing the first
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 cutting edge large scale greenhouses
that will require 150 employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He already has several boonies,
as he calls them, on his crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's paying some of them to fix up the
town's century old Veterans of Foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: Wars building where Morley and Ayode dine
on frozen pizzas and Dos Equis beers at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is still a sign on the VFW's
wall declaring a zero tolerance policy for
[SPEAKER_00]: drug use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bartender Edna Rivera doesn't flinch
as the two pot barons brainstorm about
[SPEAKER_00]: recruiting Israeli cannabis researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As she rightly observes between serving up
rounds of beers, if it makes money,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, this article is about my
hometown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me kind of proud to see that we
are the Silicon Valley of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of proud to have been in this
since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the manager and lead budtender at
the very first and only dispensary to ever
[SPEAKER_00]: exist in the city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, there are no dispensaries in
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the only shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were shut down by the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes me proud to see that we have
bloomed to become the Silicon Valley of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this article, there are three pictures
that came from my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of our building with our
Bob Marley on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of our badass,
one of our grow rooms with my buddy John
[SPEAKER_00]: Verna in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, John?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm looking at a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a map inside of the dispensary
and it's a map that all of the visitors
[SPEAKER_00]: can put a pin in the state where they are
from or the city where they're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put a little picture of our map
in there and it's getting filled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, somebody from every state has
been to our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like what's this up here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not up in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's somebody from Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody from Maine has been to our shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm getting rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's enough podcast for this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
