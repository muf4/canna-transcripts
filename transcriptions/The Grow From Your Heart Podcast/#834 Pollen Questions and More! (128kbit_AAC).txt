[SPEAKER_01]: Show up to the dude grows growers cup and
say hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get on social media later
and hear people talk about I saw you with
[SPEAKER_01]: the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you were busy bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was busy but I'm never too busy to make
new friends at the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stop by the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also you may be asking how can I get those
t-shirts so that I can get that free gift
[SPEAKER_01]: at the dude grows cup at the iry genetics
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those t-shirts they are very easy to
acquire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to my website irygenetics.com iry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Jamaican word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means to feel super blessed powerful
and positive feeling iry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a tab on that website that says
merch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that merch guess what
you'll find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Merch brah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be rolling trays if there's
still any left.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good merch there at the
iry genetics merch tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out the merch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear it to the dude grows growers cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Free seats bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've covered most of the
business now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have one brand new important
announcement to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are approaching the month of April.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode will come out just before the
start of April.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that it is time for the April
sale on irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a link to iry direct on
irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll both get you to the seeds if
you're looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just click around poke around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But irydirect.com is the website for the
beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to start that 420 sale on April
1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you hit irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go see the new sale pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to add a few new things as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a few new five packs on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things will only be available in five
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that some of the five packs are
more desirable for some of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some things will be available in five
packs and there will be brand new items.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will there be Ross to Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something called April O'Neill.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is April O'Neill?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Indiana bubblegum to blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what is the other brand new one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the Baxter Stockman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baxter Stockman is the grape candy to the
blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two amazing new strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a continuation of a series that
I did a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the collectors will be after those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a limited number of those
available on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will reserve a few packs, a very limited
number of packs for the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these will drop April 1st on the
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon members will get a newsletter
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks on the newsletter will get
another newsletter about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will advertise on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds will go quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention for April O'Neill and
Baxter Stockman to drop April 1st on
[SPEAKER_01]: irydirect.com as part of the 420 sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been rambling for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we've covered a lot of
business here at the top of today's
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to skip the pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I want to make sure to cover a few
grow questions in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier, I mentioned my website,
irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top of that website, there is a tab
that says Grow Help.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that Grow Help tab,
that gives you the opportunity to tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: a few things about your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ask questions like, what strain are you
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing indoors or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using HPS or metal halide light?
[SPEAKER_01]: We ask a few basic questions to give me an
idea of how to answer the question that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at the bottom, we give you plenty of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give you plenty of opportunity to type
in great detail about the issue that is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send a question to that Grow Help
tab and I do read your question here on
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast, I will send you a coupon code
for a free pack of seeds off of irydirect
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's first question came from a person
who wants to be called Doradguy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how you say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to call you D for now so
I don't have to keep saying your name
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my new friend D.
[SPEAKER_01]: D's question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, I love your
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a great way to start off an
email, my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I am living here in prohibition
land and I have to grow covertly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you be very careful out there in
prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person that wrote this is a
hypothetical character does not really
[SPEAKER_01]: exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is not Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all fictional.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, maybe possibly hypothetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently am growing in a small portion
of a closet, so I have used one and two
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the small space so you'd run
smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good logical decision there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here is where we come to a great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, by limiting the size of the
plant, am I also limiting the potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: I must say that the flower I've gotten so
far has been pretty good, but not great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have to let her grow to her full
potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're running in a small space,
you've got small pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to grow smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those plants going to reach their full
potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you limiting yourself on potency
was the main part of the question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that as long as you let that plant
finish its full flowering cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: those hormones and that trichome
development is what you are going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really don't think you are limiting
yourself by running small plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first question, though, is are you
running from seed or are you going from
[SPEAKER_01]: clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: That may make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those clones are technically the age of
whichever plant they were cut from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that that blows some people's
minds when I say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's think about that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a mother plant that is,
we'll say, three months old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three months old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some bush to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut clones from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those clones are the age of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're three months old when you cut
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in three months, that clone is
technically a six month old plant in all
[SPEAKER_01]: technicality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps those smaller plants,
even if the hormones and everything wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: developed properly in your smaller plants,
if you're running from a clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: it technically already is all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the age of that original plant like
I've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're running clones, it definitely
shouldn't be an issue at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds, as long as you veg them up for a
couple of weeks, two or three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then flip, it sounds like you've got
plenty of time to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be fully developed and give
you a great outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you let them flower long
enough, that may be something that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like you're also kind of,
if you're running in a small, tight space
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, you might be a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't expect that first crop to be amazing
and impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one you learned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out what you don't like about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out how to improve on that and then
work from there and make it better next
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the VPD?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the circulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the light quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: The light quality is going to have a lot
to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't put a really powerful light in
that small space, but put as much light as
[SPEAKER_01]: you possibly can in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most efficient the proper spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a good light in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the air?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the VPD basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's your feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: How often did you feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was the pH and the EC of each feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you make every feeding and every
watering to that plant count?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it all strategic or was it just done
kind of willy-nilly?
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll make a difference in your next
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you take a lot of notes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what you did last time so that
you can look back and say, this seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: have worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: This right here was an experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have thrown me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe take notes on future grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next notes to myself are I run small
plants a lot when I'm doing new projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say I just bred a bunch of new
seeds and I want to see what those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: have created.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll run a bunch of tiny plants just so I
could see what they look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of growing them big and tall and
wasting time, I'll run them real small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come out with really satisfactory
results from just little tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may have only been just a couple of
blunts or a few fat joints or something to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for the throat clearing,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep my train of thought here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may have been little plants that
gave me just a few bong rips or a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of fat joints to smoke, but we definitely
enjoyed every rip and every puff of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it did come to its full
potential, even though it was a little
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those smaller plants, the advantage of
those smaller plants, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to do small plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in a small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But smaller plants is less time for
potential problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing anything for less time,
you've got less potential for things to go
[SPEAKER_01]: long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're just running vegging for
three weeks, a little tiny plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: while I'm over here vegging for eight
weeks, I got five more weeks for spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites to sneak in, for powdery mildew to
pop up, something like that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're harvested five weeks ahead of me
before I've even thought of harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm still vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you're going to get more crops
per year with that short veg time with
[SPEAKER_01]: small plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may run into smaller problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing it sounds like you need to
work on is diagnose the problems which are
[SPEAKER_01]: making your cannabis not meet your
expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then improve from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Dee, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your email because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds on iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this next question that popped
up is a breeding question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from somebody that we are
going to call NBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who you are, NBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your email because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message goes, Hey Rasta Jeff,
I love your podcast, specifically the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that feature breeding information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here you go because you've got a
good breeding question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love your support as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have a question about breeding
specifically, since I know that you do
[SPEAKER_01]: this for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure you would be the best person to
ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, I do do it for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, I do it for sanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it out of passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it because I am strongly compelled to
do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you stopped buying the seeds,
if nobody followed me on social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: if the world went blackout and everybody
disappeared and all I had was a grow light
[SPEAKER_01]: and some seeds, I would still grow and
breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would all still happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do do it for a living, but I also do
it just out of necessity or I might blow
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I didn't breed and smoke a bunch of
good ganja and produce and create good
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, I have something I might just
spontaneously combust anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says,
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand this very strongly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect timing equals more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the better you can time it,
the more seeds you will produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would recommend just getting the
pollen straight from the plant onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: females because gathering it, storing it,
that reduces viability maybe by a small
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can just get it straight from the
plant onto the other plants without
[SPEAKER_01]: storing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is possible, that's what I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is all about the timing as the main
ingredient here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get more in detail about the
timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put the boy and the girl in the
room at the same time, just a male plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and a female plant and don't do anything,
they will make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the timing of nature, the timing of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One may be a longer flower plant,
one may be shorter, but it will work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be viable pistols when pollen
is available that will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes if you put certain plants in
ahead of time, then put the male in or put
[SPEAKER_01]: the male in and put the females in at
certain times, then you will achieve much
[SPEAKER_01]: higher seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the examples that I always use in this
situation, two plants that I breed with
[SPEAKER_01]: quite often are the platinum tangy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The platinum tangy plant is the mom to the
sun kiss, the mom to the orange gazum,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mom to the tangy ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the other side, we've got the
strawberry fields plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the mom to strawberry starburst,
the red pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else have we done with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of stuff that came from
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sun kiss plant prefers to receive
pollen between days 21 and 26 ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm saying ish, I've done it indoors,
outdoors, there's a window there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's about a week, that 21 to 26 day
window there is when that orange gazum or
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun kiss plant, the platinum tangy,
wants that pollen the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I said a bunch of different
strains, and my brain skips when we think
[SPEAKER_01]: about strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Platinum tangy is the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that platinum tangy wants the pollen
around day 21 to 26, but the strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: fields plant, that one wants its pollen
around day 28 to day 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I put the male in the room and let
everybody go at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get a minimal amount of seeds from
both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if I put that strawberry fields
plant in the room a week ahead,
[SPEAKER_01]: get it pollinating, put that platinum
tangy plant in the room a week later,
[SPEAKER_01]: or not pollinating, get it growing,
get it flowering, get a bunch of pistols
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if I bring in that male when he's
already got a bunch of pollen on him and
[SPEAKER_01]: shake him, that's when I'm going to get
the maximum amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other option, of course, is to collect
that pollen, bring it and then shake that
[SPEAKER_01]: bag of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said a moment ago, I do,
I have, I will store pollen, but I get
[SPEAKER_01]: better results from not storing it because
coming straight from the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't lose anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no static electricity doesn't kill
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cold, the change, the environment
stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing kills any of that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still 100% viable as it comes off of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the way I would recommend doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I'm going to touch on,
I don't know if this is even, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote this on my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought of this while I was
rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've noticed, and this may just
be, I've noticed this, I've seen this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be bro science because I don't
have a lab coat, but I've seen this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I've got a male plant and a female
plant in the same area, maybe not even in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same room, but a room apart from each
other, I feel like the girl plants get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit stickier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a little bit more pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that male plant is putting
off some sort of pheromone or if he's
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, hey ladies, I'm over here and I'm
going to get in that room in just a few
[SPEAKER_01]: days and I'm going to let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like all the ladies in the
room, they're getting hornier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're expressing that they want
pollination more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get more pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pistols just get more robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it a little bit more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem like they want that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may sound crazy to some people,
but if I've got a male plant on this side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the door and a female plant on this
side of the door, those girls get more
[SPEAKER_01]: pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they're just smelling each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if the male makes more
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good, I just thought of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, does the opposite
happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never paid attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to do that experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I want feedback in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to YouTube would be your best bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me some comments right down below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if you agree or disagree that
having plants of the opposite sex in
[SPEAKER_01]: separate rooms but not able to contact
each other, does that make them hornier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the females get stickier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the guys get more pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they build bigger loads?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Argue right down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite comment will win a prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should help out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main question is, is it better to
store the pollen and then pollinate them
[SPEAKER_01]: later or to have the male just dust them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to do the male just dusting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's if you want the whole freaking
room pollinated also, because that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pollen will fly everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be a dusty mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every pistol in the room, every bract
in the room will be seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful if that's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to just dust a few branches,
dust an area, then of course get that bag
[SPEAKER_01]: of pollen, get that vial, get out your
q-tip, your paintbrush, however you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then paint up a few branches that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that I do it, I put that dude
in another room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get him flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I flower out the girls at their specific
times in their room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I drag the boy into the room,
give him a good shake at the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here's a free tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for clearing the throat so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to edit this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live to drive is what we're calling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after I do that pollination,
I wait five, seven, maybe ten more days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep an eye on that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll see that there's more
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's building up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to fall again.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, give him a good shake or
cut the top off even and go smack the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and let that pollen rain down onto
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even take tops that have male flowers
on it with pollen and just rub them all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the girl plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maximum pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've answered this question
and then some.
[SPEAKER_01]: NBC, I've got your email address right
here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please make sure you check your email
address.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this episode comes out,
you will have a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I'm talking about those coupon codes
for those free seeds, let me throw out a
[SPEAKER_01]: little reminder, a little update,
something that I was thinking about here
[SPEAKER_01]: that probably should have gone at the
start of the show, but I didn't write it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These coupon codes, they do come with
expiration dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked if they have to use that
coupon code by that expiration date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I can't make those coupon
codes last forever because they're in my
[SPEAKER_01]: computer system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's technical issues technically and
budgeting and finances and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I cannot extend or change the
expiration dates of those coupon codes
[SPEAKER_01]: once they are issued.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, please do use those quickly before
they do expire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you missed it, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the last disclaimer for that,
the last chance for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is an expiration date and that
is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't change that, can't fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't have free seeds floating
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to do accountability,
accounting-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got to have an expiration date.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one more great question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one also came from the Grow Help tab
at iredigenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our new friend,
Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you, Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom is quick and to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, when picking a breeding project,
should you top your male plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an early shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just pollinating her sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an F.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by doing this, would it become an F3?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple things here to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should you top your male plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't top my males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like him just to make that big,
giant, donkey dick pollen sack up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just all that pollen on that one giant
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't top the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an early shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're pollinating its sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying, by saying sister,
did that come from the same batch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pollinated a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That girl made seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grew those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would equal brother and sister to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said those are F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: By doing this, does it become an F3?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been following along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, my friend, you win a free pack of
seeds off of iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short part of the question is,
do I top the male plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I do not top male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pollinating sisters to make F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a quick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom, thank you for the great question,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives us time to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: To one more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from somebody that wants to
be called Razi J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Razi, make sure you check that email for
your free seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like Razi is also an Aussie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hey, Jeff, J here from Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love the podcast and have listened for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, I hope you are well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to all of our Australian
listeners and viewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just happened to be wearing a Natalie
Rice shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natalie happens to also be from Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Miss Rise, Rise Nation in
full effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But big shout out to the whole Australian
nation, all the cannabis farmers and
[SPEAKER_01]: growers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you got to get that stuff
legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some medical or recreational cannabis
going for the Australian people out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a white mic in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is I'm the ganja
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the spokesperson that comes and talks
about growing and smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll smoke on camera and I'll do this
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: White mic is my partner in crime,
the other side of this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where he's the guy that will help with
city council and help write the rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: address the politicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he will go speak in front of those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk to the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll speak to Babylon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need somebody in Australia that wants
to stand up and do the white mic position.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love and respect all you growers out
there that want to be the grower guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody has got to stand up and be
possibly the martyr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's what you're going to make
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somebody's got to stand up and say,
hey, Australia or wherever, something
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller and then work bigger, but say,
hey, we need marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need medical cannabis here on our
nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would help out a lot and speak up for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them how and why and show them what
it would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach them that it's not a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach them that we're not criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach them that we smoke and we're
peaceful and it actually helps a lot of us
[SPEAKER_01]: in a medical way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach them the business aspect of how
cannabis can be beneficial to the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: nation, to the entire island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I wish people in Australia could
have some legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a person out there that's
listening that just needed that little
[SPEAKER_01]: kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you were the person that could
spark legal cannabis in the whole nation
[SPEAKER_01]: of Australia and get everybody smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that be awesome?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough of a pep talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says story leading to a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives me some clarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I had four plants in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those intersects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know what you're going to say
and produced a small amount of flowers on
[SPEAKER_01]: the lowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I noticed I pulled it out of the
tent, but the others got pollinated and
[SPEAKER_01]: they are seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here comes the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, will the seeds from the
other plants have intersex issue or will
[SPEAKER_01]: there be some feminized or regular seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good common question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also one of my pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's touch on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend is growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those plants went intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that you used the word intersex
on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the correct word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the word hermy is a pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herm is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermy bothers me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know why, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So intersex was absolutely the correct
word here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant through male and female parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those male parts have now pollinated other
females in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, what about these
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they regular?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they feminized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they more herms?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is they are not feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not how femme seeds are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not be femmes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that 50% of that breeding project
has intersex traits in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now bred it to another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that at least 50% of the
breeding has got intersex potential in
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant, in that line of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could be intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be good seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could grow some amazing magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, they could be straight up
intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they could be weird mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are not feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be completely clear, they are not
considered feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was done to make them feminized,
to ensure that they are female?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we call a feminized seed,
is a seed that has been produced in a
[SPEAKER_01]: proper way that we know and can guarantee
that it's female.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's work to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are intersex bag seed that could
be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend you grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find the next hot fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have the next chem dog,
the next Girl Scout cookies in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could have a bunch of intersex
trash in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't share them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just grow them yourself in your space and
see what you've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's the short answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is also the long answer.
