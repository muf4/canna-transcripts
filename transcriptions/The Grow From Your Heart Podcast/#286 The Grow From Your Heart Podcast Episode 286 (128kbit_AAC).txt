[SPEAKER_05]: Hey everyone, this is Daven Branny,
and you're listening to the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this baby hits 88 miles per hour,
you're gonna see some serious shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, what you gonna do now?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we gonna do right here is go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far you going back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's we go with a little something like
this?
Hit it!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Thursday, and that means it's time
for another Throwback Thursday episode of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the old episodes,
let me make a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I mention any advertising, any
giveaways, any promotions or any contests,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that stuff has expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no advertisements, promotions,
giveaways or contests that are valid in
[SPEAKER_00]: these old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening,
and with no further ado, here's a block of
[SPEAKER_00]: old episodes of the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 179 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_00]: even someone who is just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: For letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Koosh and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hope you guys are joining me on a
smoke session right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got done smoking some huge dads of
Cascade Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cascade was grown by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extraction was done by our friend,
the Barefoot Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm smoking through my Hitman
Hammerhead rig with a brand new quartz
[SPEAKER_00]: banger from our friends at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped by Elevate today, had to replace
a few names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nails and carb caps and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in there thinking I was going to
buy two things and I walked out there with
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bag of goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice work, you guys took all my money
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Elevate
Glass at 517 South Day Home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go visit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a new rig, if you need a carb
cap, if you need a nail, if you need an
[SPEAKER_00]: e-nail, they had all kinds of great new
shit in there today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an e-nail that you can operate
with your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the lighting scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a light of every color on top of it
and you could open up this app on your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone and you can make that thing look
like a damn light show at a fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to our friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check them out, 517 South Day Home in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since we're doing shout outs,
huge shout out to my friends at Handmade
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm wearing this Grow From Your
Heart podcast hoodie and I am nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super cold here in Colorado,
but I am not shivering at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hoodies look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some artwork done,
if you need shirts, if you need hoodies,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you need stickers, if you need hat
pins, I highly recommend my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, HandmadeApparel.biz for all
your custom printing needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you listen to the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take very good care of you
getting all of your printing work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since we're doing shout outs,
holy crap, you guys, I've been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about Patreon for the past few weeks on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Patreon account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain Patreon really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a website where people can go
and they can sign up to financially
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sign up, you put in your credit card
info and once a month, it will pay me the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that you have decided to give me or
donate to me or contribute to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday I got an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has decided that every month they
are going to contribute $10 to the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person is throwing down $10 every
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want your name said on
the show, so I'm not going to call you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like your name said on the show,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will certainly say it for you because I
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to everybody that has
thrown down a Patreon contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roll through on the first of the
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them around the third into my PayPal
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm not trying to get rich off
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said many times, I'm using the
Patreon contributions to cover the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: my website and it will also replace some
recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My SD card from my Zoom H6 took a shit,
so I will use the funds to replace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do more podcasts on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy these little microphone covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to rub it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little foam microphone cover here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy a lot of those because I try to give
a fresh foamy cover when the guests come
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have a fresh foam cover on there
because people cough into it and people
[SPEAKER_00]: rub the faces on it on accident because
they forget the mic's there and they bump
[SPEAKER_00]: into it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend the money on these little foam
covers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I'm going to need a new
MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel this one's starting to slow down
and glitch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that funding will go,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge thank you to those people that
contributed to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that just threw down $10 per
month, that is super amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more information on Patreon,
go to patreon.com slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you want is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's get down to the
... Music won't turn down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mixer's down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get down to business, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about proper
mixing and watering techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was asking me questions about
mixing their nutrients and mixing their
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and then I got a tweet about mixing
nutrients and mixing water, and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be a great episode to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a friend starting a brand new
hydro setup, and he needed some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I was going to talk about it,
I figured let's put a microphone in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's podcast is going to be about
properly mixing your nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're going to talk a little bit
about properly watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, before I get too far
into this, I want to say that this advice
[SPEAKER_00]: should work for small gardens,
large gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should work for soilless and soil
gardens, and this also should work for
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there will be some adjusting to
be done for different applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most of this will apply to most
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a TLO or a no-till or a
living soil, this probably won't work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you no-till and TLO guys, we'll get
frosty organics back, we'll get barefoot
[SPEAKER_00]: back, and we'll do another show about that
organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, we're going to talk about
mixing with bottles and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first point will be clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good water is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse osmosis water, RO water is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that not everybody can get an
RO machine and install it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom or in their kitchen for their
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't do RO water, tap water is
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap water, I would
recommend that you go to either the pet
[SPEAKER_00]: store like the fish tank store or either
the hydroponic store and get yourself an
[SPEAKER_00]: aquarium air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, is a pump that sits
outside of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might electrocute yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pump that goes outside of the
water and it's got a line that runs to an
[SPEAKER_00]: air stone and you'll need to buy some
clear line, some flex hose or some clear
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have the right size line sitting
right next to the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll need air stones to put in
the bottom of your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll fill up your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the aquarium air pump next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea to have the aquarium air
pump higher than your water because if the
[SPEAKER_00]: power does go out, you don't want water
siphoning down the line and coming out at
[SPEAKER_00]: the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has happened before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep the pump higher than the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it on the ground because it can
work as a siphon if the power goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your filled container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your aquarium air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your plastic line going to some
air stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those air stones go in the bottom of that
container that's filled with water and you
[SPEAKER_00]: plug it in and it simply bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn it up all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might get kind of loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just be like, just turn it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bubble and it'll bubble,
bubble, bubble that chlorine out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully within 24 to 48 hours,
you'll get rid of most of that chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some things that can only be
taken out by reverse osmosis, but
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, if you are running a home grow
and your grow is not water, large enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to where you've got extra money to invest
in an RO machine, you're probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be okay using tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's not that major of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is if you're
using tap water, you can use less CalMag
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you're using reverse osmosis
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tap water already has plenty of
calcium in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can reduce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using RO, you need to use the
recommended amount or pretty close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the major difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be okay if you can't use
reverse osmosis water is what I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the temperature of
your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that when you're
mixing your nutrients, you have your water
[SPEAKER_00]: between 65 and 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's best for your pH and for your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going hydro, I can say that if
you go anywhere above 70, you do kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage algae growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going hydro, try to keep your
water around 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going soil, soil is mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 to 75 works.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 is about ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 is a little low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never go lower than 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you water your plants with water that's
cooler than 65, they will start to make
[SPEAKER_00]: this claw-like shape in the leaves and
they will stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like sticking your feet or your
hands in cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't do that to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water is coming out of your spigot
or your spout, wherever your water is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from, if the source is too warm or
too cold, for example, right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado, it has been ridiculously
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 17 degrees the other day when I
went to work at seven in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filled the containers with water from
the RO machine and that water was 62
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no chance I was going to feed
that water to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use bucket heaters to heat the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too cold, you can use chillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not looking to invest money in
items to keep your water at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, you can use the lights in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are filling your reservoir and
putting your bubblers in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can move that to the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may deal with a little bit more
humidity, but the grow lights in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room will get your water to the correct
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a little while, but that will
get it to the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may also have the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a hydro grow and you've
got the hydro reservoir in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps you're running a flood and drain
table and the reservoir is underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the room is heating up the water too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you're going to need a
chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually realized that I said something
wrong a couple of minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your water is too cold, you need a
bucket heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your water is too warm,
that's when you need a chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized as I was saying it that I said
that backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've covered the basics of getting
your water to the appropriate temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to talk about measuring and
mixing your nutrients into your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you need for this is a
clean and accurate measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have some measuring cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the shot glass and the beer glass
looking style cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really easy to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall with them is they are glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're clumsy like me, it may be better
for you to get the plastic style.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get something with milliliters,
with tablespoons and teaspoons,
[SPEAKER_00]: with ounces, because each brand of
nutrients is going to ask for different
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like brands that go by milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Milliliters per gallon is my favorite,
but each brand does their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll need a measuring cup or a
measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using dry nutrients like veg
bloom, you may need a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you have a pH meter,
a PPM meter, and possibly an EC meter and
[SPEAKER_00]: a thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can highly recommend the Blue Lab combo
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all of the above on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the PPM, the EC, the pH,
and a thermometer all in one unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I can recommend if you,
with any pH meter, keep the probe wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal it up somehow with some pH seven
solution in there and keep that probe wet
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you can, because that will keep
it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say about pH probes, if it dries,
it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that fucker wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also calibrate your equipment
frequently, at least once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with it a lot,
do it once a week, but at least once a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the big grow, if I'm working in a big
grow, you guys, you know, I bounce around
[SPEAKER_00]: from large grow to large grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's up to me when I'm using those pH
meters about once every two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch myself just go into some solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dump the pH solution into a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that's four and then one
that's probably seven or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just check them and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't come out perfectly
accurate, take a minute and fix the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe five, maybe 10 minutes at the
absolute most.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's frustrating, you give me a hard
time, it'll get quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just adjust the calibration on your pH
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I went off on a rant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need a bucket or a
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a clearly marked measurement area,
either like a reservoir from the hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: shop that is already a predetermined
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what I like to use is the, I think
they're 32 and 55 gallon Rubbermaid trash
[SPEAKER_00]: cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy the trash can at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also get the little wheels that go
underneath it so that you can roll that
[SPEAKER_00]: sucker around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will get a five gallon bucket or
one of those five gallon, like the Deep
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock water bottles or whatever,
brand water bottle, the five gallon kind
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go buy one of those and I will use it
to measure out five gallons and I'll mark
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the inside and the outside of my
trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll measure to 10 gallons and
mark it on the inside and outside of my
[SPEAKER_00]: trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll do 15 and I'll do it in
increments of five all the way up to 25 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 or 50 or however big my container is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I can see five, 10,
15, or however many gallons I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a clean marked container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you could put water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need to be movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to get it from your water to
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how you're going to carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you guys are probably just going
to be mixing in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Lowe's bucket, the Home Depot
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to buy one of those fancy
reservoirs from the grow store,
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be my guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great in pictures and it's
already marked for the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind as soon as you pull up
to the house and carry that thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, everybody knows you grow weed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a chosen reservoir,
a chosen container.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is that you
need to clean this occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would clean it probably every use if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a big trash can, I understand
that's kind of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a place to rinse it out
and hose it out, try to get to it as
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some biofilm buildup on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will start to mess with your EC,
your PPM and your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only takes a few extra minutes to just
clean stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a trash can, you could probably
sneak it out to the backyard and hose it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People won't wonder too much what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that reservoir from the
hydro store, everyone's like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's cleaning his weed reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you might want to think
about what you're going to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hosing out a five gallon bucket is really
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that in the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that in the shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think about cleaning your
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that frequently, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to clean the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next step is to fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either using your RO water or your
tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it up to if you need 15 gallons,
if you need 20 gallons, fill it to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you need it to that gallon amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a five gallon bucket,
fill it up to the five gallon point.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a five gallon bucket, there will be
some extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not fill it all the way to the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably like an inch or two of
extra space in there, maybe three inches
[SPEAKER_00]: of extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fill it all the way to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making a reservoir, try to have
a little extra room in your reservoir as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about why here in just
a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you fill up your container and you
check the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would do is check the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the temperature is too high or too low,
we're going to use the proper tool,
[SPEAKER_00]: either the bucket heater or maybe an
aquarium heater or a chiller, or we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use the heat from the grow room,
or we're going to use whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you got to do it, get that water
to the appropriate temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap water, you may have
wanted to fill this up 24 to 48 hours in
[SPEAKER_00]: advance so that you could start bubbling
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also get your temperature
correction device in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, so that when it comes time
to mix the nutrients, you're already at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running a commercial grow
before you leave tonight, fill up your
[SPEAKER_00]: containers with water, put your chillers
or your bucket heaters in there and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them run for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set them on a timer, maybe to click on
three hours before you come in in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit might start getting right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be correct by the time you get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think ahead, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking ahead and growing is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your container, get the
temperature of that water correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to mix up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's when you need that clean mixing
container, that clean measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're mixing, be accurate,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bottle says, okay, this is a side
rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bottle says 50 mL per gallon,
you can probably get away with 25 to 30 mL
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever you decide to mix,
be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wrote down that your mix is 30 mL,
put 30 mL in that bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do 29, don't do 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be as accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be as accurate as you can and your plants
will love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to take better notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to correct things in the
future if you see problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're mixing your nutrients,
be as accurate as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, never mix your bottled nutrients
together without mixing them into a large
[SPEAKER_00]: container of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nutrients are in separate bottles
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just because they want to sell
you two bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are elements in each bottle that if
they were sold together would bind and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would deactivate basically the ingredients
that are in each bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you pour bottle A into this much
water, it dilutes it strong enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: where when you pour bottle B into that
much water, it will not create a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: bond and it will not disrupt your
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never mix your nutrients together
without plenty of water in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into actually doing the
mix, the actual mix of the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: making the soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I should talk about is wear
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some nitrile gloves, some rubber
gloves, some hand protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things you're going to be
touching, pH down is bad for your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: My skin reacts funky to CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: From some brands of CalMag, my skin will
get splotchy if I touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the things that we play with in
the grow are not really good for our skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend that when you walk into the
grow, you're just wearing rubber gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black nitrile is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fit the best shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make my hands smell super
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you're mixing nutrients,
you guys wear eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might feel nerdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in there to be stylish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some sort of protective eyewear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's those goggles, the science lab
goggles, that's probably what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend because I have heard a story of
a friend who actually listens to this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was mixing nutrients in his private
grow and he splatched maybe one drop of pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down in his eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to pull his phone out of his pocket
and he had to use Siri to call 911 for
[SPEAKER_00]: himself because he could not see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went into full panic mode because it
hurt so bad and he had to call the police
[SPEAKER_00]: and the paramedics to come to his grow to
rescue him because he got products in his
[SPEAKER_00]: eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys wear eye protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get one set of eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to fuck them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful in the grow, please,
with your eyes, with your fingers,
[SPEAKER_00]: with your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about grow room safety
in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put on some nitrile gloves,
put on some eye protection, and then grab
[SPEAKER_00]: your clean and trusty measuring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about actually
mixing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I asked our Facebook friends and my
Instagram friends for guidance on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nine out of 10 people said,
mix your potassium silicates first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using some sort of potassium
silicate product, if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare, it's just called potassium
silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using Osa 90, is it Osa 90 or
28?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever Osa product you're using,
if you're using Osa for potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicates, everybody says to put that in
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium silicates first, stir that
for a few minutes, get it emulsified.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it fully emulsified into your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see it in there, you need to
stir longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the potassium silicates,
everybody recommends that you add Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add in the recommended or appropriate
amount of Cal Mag, stir again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, if you're using
Micro, that's when you would add in your
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using Micro, you might want
to read about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your nutrient line has something
else that is covering the Micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check and see what you're missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, everybody would recommend that
you use your base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a brand that only has one
bottle of base nutrients, add in your base
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients at the appropriate amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using something like Advanced
Nutrients that has an A and a B,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would definitely do A first,
give it a little stir, then put in B and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a little stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is all about chemical bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing things in this order so that
things do not bond in specific ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mix in your potassium silicate,
your Cal Mag, your Micro, your base,
[SPEAKER_00]: your A and B if you have a two-part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when you would add in any
other additives that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're adding a bloom booster,
if you're adding any sweeteners or bud
[SPEAKER_00]: hardeners, those would all get mixed in
last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something that somebody recommended to
me, and I checked on this and it made
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, stir counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is all about bonding of
certain molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds crazy, you guys,
but do research on that if you'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stirring your solution counterclockwise
will have a difference in bonding of
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules in your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested, read about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got all of our products stirred
into our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all been stirred counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all at the appropriate temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hanging out for a couple of seconds,
getting all mixed in together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to check the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we want to check the PPMs?
[SPEAKER_00]: The particles per million tells us how
much stuff is in our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you feed your plants too much
stuff, they're going to choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that there's not
too much stuff in there, not too many
[SPEAKER_00]: particles, not too many nutrients,
not too many elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many PPMs do we want to get our
water to?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of depends on what phase of
growth or bloom you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seedlings and small plants don't need a
lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need a lot of PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to start off at a lower PPM for my
smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere around 600 to 900 PPMs for the
small stuff, like the small veg plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: cups and small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get bigger, I do increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week four, I'm usually up to about 1500
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In veg, I don't really go too hard with
the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them base nutrients, potassium
silicates, Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give them some stuff to keep them
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And root-wise, but they really don't get a
whole lot of nutrients in the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want them to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to get stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we start flowering, that's when I
kind of start boosting it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week one of flowering, I'll probably start
off right about maybe a thousand or 1300
[SPEAKER_00]: PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will increase until I hit,
honestly, I'll get close to 1900 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I would not recommend if
you're using bottled nutrients and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not a very experienced grower,
you probably shouldn't get over 1700 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 1800 particles per million in your
solution or you'll start burning your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you know what you're doing
and you can mix and match nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're not giving it too much of one
thing, but you're supplementing what's
[SPEAKER_00]: missing by adding more PPMs, then you may
be able to get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be very careful because once you've
burnt the plants, you can't take that
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give more, but you can't take
anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, most of the feed charts that
come with bottled nutrients these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them are pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow that feed chart,
maybe reduce it, maybe use about 75% of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the bottle says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the companies will make a feed
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it online, follow that,
and it won't get you over 1700 or 1800
[SPEAKER_00]: PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see what that chart does and
adjust from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go a little harder,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you realize you need to go a little
lighter, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that you could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your solution mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're checking your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like it's right where you want
it, now you need to adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like the PPMs are too high,
if you feel like it's too hot for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you can simply add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got everything mixed up and the
PPMs are hitting more than you want for
[SPEAKER_00]: that week and you feel like it's too hot
for the plants, add a little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using RO water, put RO water in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap water, add more tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your PPM meter and put it in your
solution that's mixed up and then get your
[SPEAKER_00]: regular water and just slowly add it and
watch the numbers on your PPM meter go
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you've get it to the
acceptable appropriate number,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can stop and that's when it's
time to adjust your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing you do is adjust your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need your pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put it in the water,
give it a little stir around, give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple seconds to adjust and see where you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's up too high, you need to put some
pH down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're too low, you need to put some pH
up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good area for your plants, for most
plants to be, is 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH your solution to 6.2 and you should be
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: My smaller plants, they go a little lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My larger plants may get a little higher,
but 6.2 is a good general range of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a whole episode about the importance
of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded that episode on August 10th of
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually episode number 88 and it is
called The Importance of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check that out,
it is still in the feed on iTunes and
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher and it's on the website
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a hundred episodes available
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to go back in history,
check those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's episode number 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called The Importance of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, so we've got our
reservoir filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our nutrients mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our PPMs adjusted to the
appropriate PPMs to where it won't be too
[SPEAKER_00]: strong of a solution for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our pH adjusted to approximately
6.2 or whatever you're finding appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: for your garden at this stage of its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about actually physically
feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running an auto hydro system or
a soil or soilless or cocoa system that's
[SPEAKER_00]: on a drip system, make sure that the
plants get, that the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the soil gets fully saturated when
you water those plants with your
[SPEAKER_00]: automation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to figure out how long it comes
on and how frequently that watering system
[SPEAKER_00]: comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to do an entire episode about
building a watering system and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be probably two or three
episodes from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may put that one out as a Thursday bonus
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running an automated system,
mainly focus on getting everything
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated, let it dry kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then saturate it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to run the timer and see how
long it takes to saturate the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have to pay attention to
how long it takes them to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have to make that timer
run again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's duration and interval is what
you're going to have to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes a day to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much how you're going to
have to set up any drip system with any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of hydro or cocoa or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that if you're using cubes
or whatever you're using, make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they get fully saturated and that they've
got the appropriate dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just repeat that cycle over and
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants get larger and further into
the flower phase, you may have to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: either the duration of watering or the
less interval between waterings is
[SPEAKER_00]: something you'll have to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see that happening as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk more about that in
that auto watering episode that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about watering your soil or
cocoa or soilless mix plants that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're watering with a pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're going to the reservoir and
just getting a pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal grow, I use a Kool-Aid
pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a one gallon plastic pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use two of them so that I could scoop
water with both hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are in seven gallon pots,
so they're not too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can reach them just by doing a short
bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk down the middle of the row and
water two plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scoop water out of the rez, turn a
little bit, water two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the Kool-Aid pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the commercial grow, I use a water
wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a pump in a trash can, which is the
reservoir that the trash can's on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a pump there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a pump that plugs into the wall
that runs to a hose, which runs to a water
[SPEAKER_00]: wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water wand, I basically squeeze a
trigger and the water comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got about a two foot attachment
extension on it so that I can get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are at the end of the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like the water wand for the
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I either use the pitcher or a water
wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to do it is find the
water wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tend to make a little bit of a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the pitcher, you can kind of put the
water where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the pitcher is more timely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm efficient because I can grab water and
pour it, grab water and pour it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no time for it to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just pours out of the pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the water wand, with the five gallon
pot at the commercial grow, I count to 70
[SPEAKER_00]: as I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I count one, two, three, four,
five, and it takes me to 70 to water a
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon pot appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably 50 seconds of me counting
to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how fast I just probably over count
time, but that's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd prefer the pitcher method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any way you do it, soak the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're watering the plants,
make sure you fully saturate that root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that soil needs to get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see some runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want at least a little bit of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got catch trays underneath your
plants, if they're in the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to see runoff from every single
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to know that every inch of soil
inside that pot got saturated with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and water so that when those
roots, when it does start to dry out and
[SPEAKER_00]: those roots go growing in there,
they find those nutrients in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, hey, there's some more
stuff for me to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really good to saturate the whole
thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you saturate your entire root
ball, get a little bit of runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then let them start to dry out over
the next few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't water until they get kind of
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pick them up and see how light
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they start getting light,
that's when they need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start learning the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to watch for when the leaves
start to droop just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, if you're doing it right,
your leaves are facing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit, they're praying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a good job, the leaves are
horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start getting thirsty,
they'll start to curl down and hang and
[SPEAKER_00]: droop just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see that droop is when
those plants want water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the most ideal time to water those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can figure out that timing from
when you water them to when that droop
[SPEAKER_00]: barely starts and water them right then,
every time your plants will be as happy as
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to find that timing, that sweet
spot of right before they droop and when
[SPEAKER_00]: they get super light and then water them
right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will get easier the more you grow,
the less these things will seem like a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll walk in the grove and you'll be
able to see, oh, I can tell by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the soil that that plant needs
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soak the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it some time to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then re-soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then watch the leaves for indicators of
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaves start doing funny shit,
that tells you that there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your leaves are going to tell you if the
plants were over watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are over watered,
they're going to start making a claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's over watered or too cold,
it will look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will still be horizontal and
they won't droop, but they will claw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start to look like just hold your
hand out straight and then make a claw
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're a monster, that claw shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your leaves will start doing
if they are over watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are under watered, they'll just
start drooping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just go limp and start hanging
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get severely under watered,
the tops of your plants will just start
[SPEAKER_00]: drooping over and they'll look dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be scared as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants do get to that sort of a
dryness, I recommend that you don't water
[SPEAKER_00]: them with full strength nutrients right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water them with light nutrients
just to get them alive and back to life
[SPEAKER_00]: and woken up and then feed them with
nutrients later on because the way I see
[SPEAKER_00]: it is I don't want to get woken up to a
big gigantic meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to eat spaghetti and
meatballs and garlic bread first thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have maybe some oatmeal and
some OJ to get myself started,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel plants are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're that droopy, you just want to
hydrate them and get them moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to clog them up with more
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you guys want to wake up and
eat a steak right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how I'm going to roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underwater, we talked about that burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants start looking like they're
getting crispy or if they're getting funky
[SPEAKER_00]: on the edges or if they have rust-looking
spots on them, you may be giving them too
[SPEAKER_00]: much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the edges of your leaves are starting
to get crispy and over sharp, you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: using too much CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to reduce your nutrients,
you can do that, but that burn is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on the new growth and make
sure that you're not burning the new
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay if leaves get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to go ahead and remove a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut it right off or pull it off with
your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably more leaves coming to
back that one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I've noticed is when you take
off leaves, the plants will just replace
[SPEAKER_00]: it if it needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the leaves are going to tell you if
you have any sort of deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaves start getting pale yellow,
if the plants are going slow and not
[SPEAKER_00]: growing fast enough, you probably are
missing some nutrients and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably increase your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that could be a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a lot of problems if you're
showing deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often pH issues disguise themselves
as deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about that in episode 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a lot of attention to the leaves,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paying attention to the leaves will really
help, but also keep notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep notes of what you mixed into
the solution and what you fed,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to write down what you mixed,
try to write down the pH and try to write
[SPEAKER_00]: down the PPMs of every feeding,
write down the date and time and also take
[SPEAKER_00]: notes of anything you saw in the grow room
that day so that you can look back and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a chart and some history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, oh, look, on this day,
my pH was a little high and now this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is acting funky and now I know that I need
to make the pH lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I've learned that OG cush
plants, the cushier the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more calmagic it wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stuff like golden goat is always
macro deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just stuff like that that you
learn and you can really boost up the
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients with golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just stuff you learn from growing
specific plants over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from each watering, learn from your
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that will be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely a huge part of what
makes me a better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have covered the basics and
maybe a little bit of more than the basics
[SPEAKER_00]: of mixing your nutrients and properly
watering your plants to properly saturate
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and give them some time to dry
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I posted to Facebook that I was
seeking help and guidance for this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wanted to make sure that I
didn't miss anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I posted to Instagram, I got a couple
of replies that I felt I wanted to share
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one comes from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question that I posted to Instagram
basically said, hey, I'm writing a podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have any guidance?
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks at Dragonfly Earth Medicine
said, more importantly, what bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you read ingredients and make
sure it is healthy for mind, body,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also remember there are only six
companies that sell synthetics and all
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer companies are from those six
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also say that brewing is
only expanding your microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're brewing synthetics,
you're wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is counterintuitive to brew synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like treating your body herbally and
doing a round of antibiotics at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the important part here was that we
need to pay a little bit of attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: where our products are coming from and
what we are putting into the products that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are calling medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention, make sure that what
you're using is healthy for your mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: body, and your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got another message on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, if you add a form of high
quality fulvic acid to your guy's water
[SPEAKER_00]: before anything else, it helps buffer pH
of your solution and provide a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: form of chelation without adding any NPEK
or PPMs to your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in any type of setup,
super cost efficient, and it helps your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to naturally and easily uptake the
nutrients and minerals you give them,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the hard ones such as iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy recommends that we add a form
of high quality fulvic acid and he
[SPEAKER_00]: recommends Full Power or Shilajit as the
brand to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says to add that before adding
anything else and it will help buffer your
[SPEAKER_00]: pH and it will help your plants uptake
your nutrients better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's the part that really got my
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said also we should completely move
away from harmful and non-regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: farming practices such as synthetic
fertilizer programs that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable and do more harm than good to
our garden's planet and it's limited to
[SPEAKER_00]: natural life sustaining resources of life
such as water, land, and clean air.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say there's nothing wrong
with using bottled nutrients or other
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of farming, but we must still be
aware of the effects we have on our planet
[SPEAKER_00]: and fellow man through our action or worse
yet inaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I figured I'd touch on that last
part, my shameless alternative techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from a guy who calls himself LOS
gardens on Instagram, LOS underscore
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate it because we all need
to be reminded occasionally to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to where our products are coming
from and what we're putting into ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the insight and I appreciate
the help and advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I understand that not everybody
is able to grow organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody lives in a farm area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that a lot of us live in
cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us have our neighbors right next
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost reach out one of my windows
and touch my neighbor's house is how close
[SPEAKER_00]: we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely understand that we don't all
have space to do organic farming
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that we can all conceal the
odors and the extra ingredients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: extra steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not judging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to use bottled nutrients,
let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use bottled nutrients myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just think a little bit while we're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not try to support companies that
don't support us and companies that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: support the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to choose where your money goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choose wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody who commented
and replied on my Facebook and Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: posts that helped me put this episode
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank everybody that
listened to the bonus episode that I put
[SPEAKER_00]: out Thursday You guys, if you did not
listen to the episode that I put out
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday about seasonal affective
disorder, you may want to go give that a
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, especially if you live in one of
the colder winter climates where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing our asses off for the past few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a good episode for you to listen
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have found two solutions for the
folks that have been asking for old
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a short-term solution and a
long-term solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going to tell you what I'm going
to do because they are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they are out, I will tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will be able to give it a listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate how interested
everybody is in hearing the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really lit a fire under my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get those episodes out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 22 are ready.

[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff sent you, let them know you're
listening to the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, last week, I did an episode
about mixing your nutrients and properly
[SPEAKER_00]: watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may have overlooked a couple of
things that I want to throw into this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit that I am not a very experienced
hydro grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not done a lot of hydroponic
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing hydro, if you are
mixing up a reservoir and you are putting
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in there and you start running
that for a few days, some of the water may
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to top that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and check to make sure the
water has not gone too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're in there checking,
check the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH may need to be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a daily basis, go in there and check
your hydro tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using deep water culture,
if you're using an ebb and flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're using a drain table,
however you're doing it, make sure there's
[SPEAKER_00]: enough water in your reservoir and make
sure that the pH hasn't changed too
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it has, fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may need to add a little water to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add the water, make sure your
PPMs are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your PPMs go too low, you may need to
add a little bit of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful when you do this because in
hydro, it is easy to burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I overlooked that you may
need to add water and that when you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, adjust your pH and also check your
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I need to mention about
hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good idea to remix your nutrients
approximately every seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drain that water out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put fresh water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using reverse osmosis water,
if you're using tap water, whatever kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of water you're using, clean it out,
refill it, redo your nutrient program,
[SPEAKER_00]: reset the PPMs, reset the pH and get
everything started for a fresh week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a really good idea
because your plants want a different diet
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately every seven to 10 days
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through different phases of growth,
they're going to require different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't feed your plants the exact same
stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way through veg and you definitely
don't feed them the same thing all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good idea to change the mix
every seven to 10 days anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time you're in there doing
anything with the water, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: check the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for missing that in the
last episode, but here it is for you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm helping you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I don't know if I mentioned this,
but I was mixing up nutrients for my own
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do use bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually trying to lower the pH of a
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pH was a little bit too high and
instead of using pH down or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use liquid karma from Botanic Air and it
worked very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dropped my pH right to where I needed
it and I didn't have to use a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that is actually a useful
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to lower the pH and add
something useful to my mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is shake the shit out of your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that bottle and just shake it
vigorously for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to stir it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get everything that's settled
on the bottom mixed back into the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get all the stuff stirred up
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to end up with the last bit
of that bottle having all the potency in
[SPEAKER_00]: it and then you end up burning your
nutrients or your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shake the shit out of your bottles
before you use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I feel like it's a good idea that
once you've mixed up nutrients for your
[SPEAKER_00]: potted plants, it is a good idea to use
that mix within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good idea to let that stuff sit
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to argue me and say,
but what about hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're mixing that up and running it for
seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is running.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moving constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got oxygen added to it and it's not
sitting still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix up a big tank of water and just
let it sit there with nutrients in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those products are sold in different
bottles because they're supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: kept separate until you're using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't mix this stuff up too far in
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to use it within 24 hours and I think
it will be more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to brew the synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard that from our friends at
Dragonfly Earth Medicine in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just mix it up right before you're
going to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't use it within 24 to 36 hours,
you'll start seeing it get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it starts kind of changing colors,
kind of starting to stink real bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: just dump it out, make a fresh mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got myself caught up on the
stuff I missed last week and I got through
[SPEAKER_00]: a six minute intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a gigantic dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, we're going to talk
about identifying, preventing and
[SPEAKER_00]: correcting common issues in your ganja
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am back and I am well
medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a couple of fat dabs of
Cascade Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cascade is Lemon Skunk, cross to
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our friend, the Barefoot Grower
did the extraction for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hash always makes me go completely
stupid for a couple of seconds when I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the insects are getting bad here
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are so many commercial
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are gardens everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people here in Colorado grow
cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is legal to grow cannabis in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that everybody should exercise
that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are growing cannabis at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people work in a commercial
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those people are taking bugs from
their home grow to the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then their employees and coworkers are
picking up those bugs on their clothes and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking them to their personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their friends are coming to their
house and sitting next to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spider mites are climbing across
the couch onto your buddy's t-shirt
[SPEAKER_00]: because he smells like weed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your buddy's going home and going
in his garden and putting the spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: in his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bugs are just being moved around
like STDs here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody works in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bugs have no problem getting passed
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means everybody here that is paying
attention needs to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be very diligent about their
pest management programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to prevent getting pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've got pests, it is a huge
pain in the ass getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people shut down entire gardens
because they cannot get rid of spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just takes one or two mites to
start the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can get ugly really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a commercial grow in
Pueblo that gave up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get rid of our mite issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut down all of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They close their facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility is now for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever buys that place is going to have
to go in there and clean the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it before they're able to grow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's work our way into talking about
identifying, preventing, and correcting
[SPEAKER_00]: some common issues with our ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I've got a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you treat your garden is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use harsh chemicals and
harmful pesticides in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is your decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go a more organic route,
that is your decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just please take some time to read about
what you are applying to your crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: read what it can do to people that consume
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you are applying pesticides
outside, please be much more aware of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please try to use organic ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that you are affecting my
environment also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're affecting my child's environment,
your child's environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spraying everybody's environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, those are your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows what you're doing to the
overall environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insects that travel from your property
to mine don't know any barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know any boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever you're doing over there is
going to have some sort of an effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on over here, no matter how
far apart we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please kind of be aware of what you're
putting on your garden, what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying, what you're applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you are releasing beneficial
insects, please think about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: read about it, kind of be aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I want you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing before I get into talking
about these insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started this podcast because there was
another podcast that every time somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: asked a question, the host of the podcast
would pitch products.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would read an email and talk about an
issue in somebody's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would talk about a very
specific product that would cure your
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would tell you where to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would give you a coupon code to get a
deal on that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt very dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not feel like the host of that show
was trying to improve my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like he was trying to make money
by doing a deal with a pesticide company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mention products, but I am not paid
by any of those companies to sell any
[SPEAKER_00]: products to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are products that I know will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are products that I use and have used
and have experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only reason I'm mentioning them
is because they work for me and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: they will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to sell you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not paid by any pesticide,
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not paid by any grow company at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think that a better plan
instead of buying a product and just
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying a product would be to find the
cause of your problem, correct that cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: then eradicate the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know that it will never come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you simply say, I've got spider mites
and you walk in and you spray a product
[SPEAKER_00]: and you kill all the spider mites,
good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dead temporarily, but they're
still coming in from somewhere and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get the same damn problem all
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk more about how to
prevent and correct issues instead of what
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy to solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, let's talk a little
bit about spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites are probably the most common
problem and pest in most ganja grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in most commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's a toss up between powdery
mildew and spider mites in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grower either has had or will get
spider mites at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you're going to have to
deal with as a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are over 1000 different species of
spider mites, but when you get mites on
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis, you are probably going to
get the two spotted mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the most common mite for your
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may run into a mite known as the
russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mite is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is way harder to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way harder to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you don't run into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you just get the two spotted
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about the two
spotted spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with talking about how to
identify a mite problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites give us plenty of warnings
and indications that they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to identify once they start
showing you they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll notice the tops of your
leaves look like they have been stippled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like somebody has just been
poking it with a needle and changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a spider mite on the bottom of
that leaf, sticking his little fangs in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, sucking the juice out of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will get stippling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like you've been poking at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just got little marks on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first indicator of a spider
mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second sign may be webbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the top of your buds start getting
little webs on there, they start to build
[SPEAKER_00]: like a teepee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like a little cone around
the top of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that on there, you have got
a serious spider mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge indicator that they are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're loving life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting everything they need and
you're going to have to fight to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to tell that you've got spider
mites is you may see spider mites on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the underside of your leaf is where
spider mites will live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be crawling around right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also where they lay their eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mites and the eggs may be visible if
they're there enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to get a magnifier if you
don't have a lot of them, a 60 to 100X
[SPEAKER_00]: magnifier, and just put that on the bottom
side of your leaf and watch for something
[SPEAKER_00]: to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see them climbing around,
just little round things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like little monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those eggs I was talking about,
spider mites are crazy fast breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they have babies, something fucked up
about spider mites, they have a three to
[SPEAKER_00]: one ratio of females to males.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means when four spider mites are
born, three of them are girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means they're going to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: When spider mites reproduce, they lay up
to 200 eggs at a time and they can repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: that cycle as often as every eight days if
they have the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow room is the perfect condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in there disrupting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got beautiful humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the perfect environment for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do is prevent spider mites
from getting into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see spider mites, we need to know
how to eradicate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's first talk about preventing spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building a well-sealed grow room is a
great way to keep spider mites out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Hello's or Home Depot and get some
of that expanding foam insulation and
[SPEAKER_00]: spray that in every crack in your wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, nothing can climb through those
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites are tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come through every crack,
every nook, every cranny, and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put up some pan to film, use a bunch of
tape, seal off that grow room so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have way less entrance routes for spider
mites to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come in from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also going to come in on your
clothes or they're going to come in on an
[SPEAKER_00]: infested plant or through your ventilation
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to do is anytime you get a
new clone from anybody, if it comes from a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend, if it comes from a dispensary,
if it comes from some dude on Craigslist,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you take that plant, before you
put it in your garden, make sure it is
[SPEAKER_00]: treated properly for bugs and mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to trust your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think you can trust the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you can trust that guy off of
Craigslist, but you have no idea what they
[SPEAKER_00]: might not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have spider mites, they could
have aphids, they could have thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could have fungus gnats, they could
have powdery mildew, and they don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know it and they just passed it on to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gave them money for a clone and
you actually just paid for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a free collection of spider mites
with your new clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you get a new clone, take it to
wherever you're taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow facility, your home,
your trap house, your whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: take it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it in with the rest of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it to a quarantined area and spray
the shit out of it with some products so
[SPEAKER_00]: that way you can make sure there are no
mites on it before you put it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrethrum is a great product for spider
mites, although some spider mites will
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a resistance and an immunity to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should work for most of your mite
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evergreen Pyrethrum is the brand I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can use a product called Smite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smite is a natural product made of mostly
plant oils and it is actually allowed and
[SPEAKER_00]: approved by the MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of the products I just listed are
allowed and approved in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they have been deemed safe by the
Colorado Department of Agriculture for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants that will be consumed by
humans as a medical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these two products are deemed safe by
the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I would not use them if they
were not deemed safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would remove them from my personal grows
and they would have to be removed from any
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow I am a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Evergreen Pyrethrum and Smite for
plants that are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you are an Azomax user,
Azomax is a perfect thing for plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you treat the clones that
are coming in with some sort of miticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever level of toxicity you want to use
is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go gentle, I'd recommend
the Smite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use something a little
stronger, maybe Azomax.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go real strong and get
crazy with it and make sure nothing ever
[SPEAKER_00]: lives in your garden, go ahead and hit it
with Floramite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't endorse Floramite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a potent product and
it's actually banned by the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot use Floramite in a commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you have to consider that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it online if you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever products you choose to use,
please go to that product's website and
[SPEAKER_00]: read the proper application technique and
methods for that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think, what, I just mix it up with
water, put it in a sprayer and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it on the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some other steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floramite needs to be pH adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floramite needs to be added to water at a
very specific temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of extra ingredients
for Azomax that you've probably never read
[SPEAKER_00]: and aren't even aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you wear the appropriate
clothing and protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal protective equipment is very
important when you're applying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are applying something that is very
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are moving it from the bottle where
it's concentrated and diluting it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that concentrated point, it is very
dangerous and it is very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear something to protect your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nerdy looking science lab goggles,
get a pair of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, protect your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go somewhere and get some of those black
nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect your skin and hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're spraying, wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear a respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always wear long pants and shoes when
you're applying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to eradicate pests, not yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's enough about treating
clones that are coming in to not bring
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites on your new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't drag spider mites around from
your friend's garden to your garden or
[SPEAKER_00]: from the commercial grow where you work to
your personal garden or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change clothes when traveling from one
garden to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to change your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to change your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to dedicate specific shoes to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got grow shoes and normal shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wear the same shoes in the garden
that I wear at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wear those shoes out and about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be as careful as I can because
I'm in different gardens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we should talk about is some
sort of a filtration on your ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got fresh air coming into the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need filtration on there, especially
if the air is coming from outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're bringing in air from outside,
it definitely needs to be filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring in, maybe one of
your neighbors has a male plant outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring in pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring in insects and you
don't want to bring in mold and mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else you could possibly bring in
from outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't invite problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're bringing air in from outdoors,
run it through a HIPAA filter first or get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself one of those shroom cloud
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes on the ducting and it makes
sure that nothing can pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a HIPAA filter and everything
gets caught as it comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're bringing air from one room
to another, just put those little... You
[SPEAKER_00]: can buy sheets of HIPAA filters at the
hardware store and you can cut them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: size that you need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a strip of duct tape around the edges
to where you make a little frame and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just duct tape that shit or staple gun
that shit right around all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting, any in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just duct both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a piece on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to slow down the air too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will stop bugs from moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to stop spider mites from moving
from room to room and we have to control
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put some HIPAA filters and some shroom
cloud covers over all of your intakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: outtakes and all of your holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing you can do to try to
prevent getting spider mites in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room is if you've got pets, if you've got
a dog, if you've got a cat, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend keeping that pet away from the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to have their dog in
the grow with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your dog's probably got bugs on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring him in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't wash your dog every time you
come in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been out rolling in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been out playing in the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where he's been?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking dog's out running around in
the yard, chewing shit up, shitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, getting spider mites on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let him in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about spider mite
identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about preventation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said preventation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit it because that
was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it like I meant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about preventation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my new word, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody put that on Wikipedia and in a
dictionary for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preventation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write down preventation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to look because I was like,
if I wrote down preventation, that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about identification and
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about eradication to
eradicate spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to go about getting
rid of your spider mite problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on what stage of growth
your plants are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the veg stage, it's going to
be a simple solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in flower, it's going to take
a little bit of consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need to decide if you want to go
organically, if you want to use beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, or if you want to use harsh
chemicals so that you can be sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is gone in one application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I recommend mostly organic
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you get later into flower,
I would recommend the beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: and predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about things you can apply to
your crop in veg to get rid of spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites if you do see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you can do that works
immediately, you can pull off a leaf that
[SPEAKER_00]: is infested with mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just grab the entire leaf,
yank it right off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not even part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in a trash bag, seal that trash
bag up, remove that from the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just taken care of those mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably more mites somewhere,
but at least you've gotten rid of that
[SPEAKER_00]: little colony, that whole leaf worth of
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this from day one all the way
up to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just pull off leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't do much damage to the plant if
you leave enough leaf for the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go in there and defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies to powdery mildew also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to just pull off those infected
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So defoliation is your very first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free, it's simple, and it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your next step, you can think about what
you may want to spray onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply things like we talked about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the pyrethrum spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use Smite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use Azimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a thousand products in between
that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mighty Wash works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a whole bunch of other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about what you want to do if spraying
is the way you'd like to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you want to spray,
but you aren't interested in using a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially made synthetic pesticide or
an organic pesticide, you can make your
[SPEAKER_00]: own worm compost tea, and you can make all
kinds of teas and apply those to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those beneficial bacteria that come
with those teas may run off your spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot guarantee it, but I know it's a
possibility if you use the right products
[SPEAKER_00]: in your tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something I am completely
experienced with, but as I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I'm sure that Sean and Will and Frosty
would all be yelling at me, and they'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, bro, just make a fucking tea and
spray it on those fucking plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you don't have to use any
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tea would probably work for you to
control a spider mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it would completely
eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about teas,
put a little neem or caranjamil in that
[SPEAKER_00]: tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to knock out your spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to talk about botanical
oils and stuff like neem after I talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: In flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're in flower, you don't want to
spray things onto your plants because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to fuck up your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make your buds taste
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to stay on your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're in flower, you're going to
need to consider how far into flower you
[SPEAKER_00]: are, how far away from harvest you are,
how dense those buds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to think about when you apply
this pesticide, is it still going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there when I harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to leave residuals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to make my buds and or
concentrates taste funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's stuff you need to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it harmful to humans if they do consume
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things you need to think
about early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to get away with
spraying after week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not even consider spraying
something on my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I may spray some fungus tea and some
push on the plants after week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use push one time at the start
of week four, but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that everything you spray on
these plants is going to end up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on making hash, I would not
recommend using neem oil or other
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils or botanical oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your hash and your concentrates
will taste like those oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just talked about not spraying your
plants and you've still got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, what the fuck am I going to
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got an option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where beneficial insects come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use beneficial insects from the
very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them as preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order them online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually recommend, I've got this
catalog in my hand right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm turning to the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company is called Arbico Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really enjoy this catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: This catalog comes every couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first page has a, what is IPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little lesson here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a one page on what is integrated
pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may actually turn this little leaflet
page into an entire episode in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this magazine, and once again,
they don't pay me you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, this sounds like a fucking ad,
but it's genuine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this magazine, I've just opened it up
to a couple of pages right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order lady bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order praying mantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order green lacewigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order assassin bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order minute pirate bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are aphid parasites, aphid
predators, but here's where I'm headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this magazine, you can order predatory
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are spider mites that do not eat
cannabis plants, but they do eat other
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you order these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in little packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a variety of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them delivered in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other companies do them other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I'm most familiar with,
and I like the best, they come in things
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like a tea bag and they have a
little hanger on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just hang that from your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the predatory mites will come out when
the lights go off and they'll get hungry
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll go running around looking for
something to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to find your spider mite
infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 90% of the time, these predatory mites
are going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying earlier, you can use
predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can introduce predatory mites and any
other sort of predators into your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: as early as you would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use these year round indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, they are ideal for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're best for outdoors because they're
only going to destroy your predatory or
[SPEAKER_00]: your damaging spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not going to mess up your
atmosphere, the ecosystem, the
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to eat the spider mites
and you won't even notice they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the predator
mites that I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm working with a commercial
cultivation center with a lot of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got well over a hundred lights in
there and they're integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes a spider mite called,
and I'm going to mess up the name of this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy, but he is called the Swirsky mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the S-W-I-R-S-K-I-I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's called Swirsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it pronounced multiple
different ways, but the Swirsky mite is
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that I release quite frequently
in the commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another predatory mite that we use
in the commercial grow is a guy called the
[SPEAKER_00]: persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is actually known as phytosilius
persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you see these in the catalog or
online, you'll be able to order it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one you're looking for is spelled
P-E-R-S-I-M-I-L-I-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Swirsky again was S-W-I-R-S-K-I-I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got one more predatory mite
for you to help you get rid of spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy is known as the Andersoni,
A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N-I.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these guys together will eat up all
of your spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very effective and it is very
eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So order these spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it set up to where they come at their
scheduled interval so that you remember to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply them to your garden at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set up a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like a subscription is what
you might call that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set up your subscription.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will come in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to open the box and then you'll
just find however they're shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ship in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, a lot of them come in little
tea bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them come in little satchels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just however they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a sachet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put those at the bottom of the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you lollipop your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some naked legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right where the canopy starts and
there's foliage, hang those bug packs
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can afford all three, if you choose
to use all three of these spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put one of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick a spot, maybe every six or eight
feet apart, depends on how big your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick an interval and just put one of
each of these packages in that spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your little army of mites will start
coming out and they'll just start finding
[SPEAKER_00]: little food sources and they'll start
eating the shit out of all your bad spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully they will get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one thing I need to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use beneficial insects,
you cannot spray pesticides because it
[SPEAKER_00]: will kill your beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to mix a spray with beneficial
insects, you need to learn what will not
[SPEAKER_00]: kill those insects that you can spray onto
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're using a Swirsky mite and
you've got a spray that you can apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that the mite needs to take a
bite out of the plant before it is
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be able to apply that to the
plants because the Swirsky mite is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take a bite out of your cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not hurt your Swirsky mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you sprayed smite on the
Swirsky's, it will kill them because it
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly works by suffocating the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to think about what you're
going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read as much as you can and plan ahead
because these insects, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable, but they are not free and you
don't want to buy bugs and release them
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems a little counterproductive to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we have identified spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have learned how to prevent spider
mites and we have learned how to eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're gone, you have to think about
how you got them and you have to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they got in through a crack in the
wall, if they got in through a clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: you brought, if they got in on your
dreadlocks because you've got spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: at the commercial grow, however it
happened, make sure you correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you start doing things to
prevent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work in a commercial grow,
if you're around other grows, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow consultant, if you're in the
marijuana cannabis industry, wherever you
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you're going to have to take stronger
measures than most folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to start releasing these
predator mites in your own garden every
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks just to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to start spraying something
at the first and 15th of every month to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you don't get an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you do see a sign of spider
mites, you cannot put it off until
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow because they reproduce more
quickly than rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put it off until tomorrow and
then tomorrow those spider mites will have
[SPEAKER_00]: enveloped that entire plant in a web.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like you're growing cotton
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see spider mites, get in there
today and deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the spider mites win.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on from spider mites a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys been going for a little while and
my throat's starting to burn out and I
[SPEAKER_00]: still want to do one, maybe two more
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get down to fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats are super easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little black flies that fly around
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water, they probably come flying
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk up to the plant and just tap
the root ball and tap the soil or tap the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, they'll probably come flying out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably all over your grow by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them, they're fucking annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats are also very easy to prevent
and get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: One very helpful way to prevent from
getting fungus gnats is to keep your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: dry at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats like a nice moist area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you let that top layer of the soil
dry out, they won't want to come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good way to prevent fungus gnats
that seems really easy, but some people
[SPEAKER_00]: might overlook is a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a screen on every window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also those HEPA filters we're talking
about for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff is applicable for a
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little flying insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get in any crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can come through any window.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to come to the moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to come land on your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They breed in the top layer of soil and
then they fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their only purpose is to breed and
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats don't have any other purpose
except to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've put up a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten rid of any excess moisture in
the top layer of our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have prevented fungus gnats from
coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next couple of things I'm going to
talk about can work as prevention and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can also work as ways to eradicate the
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use these products before
the fungus gnats get there, you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to wait until you already
have them, that's also an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a small personal garden,
I like to use what are known as mosquito
[SPEAKER_00]: dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them at every hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them at Big R.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little round donut looking cookie
looking things that are used to drop into
[SPEAKER_00]: like a pond or standing water to keep
mosquitoes from gathering around that
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I like to use them to get rid
of or prevent fungus gnats is I will fill
[SPEAKER_00]: my reservoir with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mix my nutrients just like normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just drop the mosquito dunk right
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it soften up for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wear rubber gloves and just
grind it up into a small powder to where
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of just dissolves into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I'm watering the plants,
I make sure to kind of push it to the side
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure to get a little bit for
every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of that stuff that I can see
goes into each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would assume that the smaller stuff
that broke up that I can't see is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: even more distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like that there's some that I can
see so I can judge a little bit of how
[SPEAKER_00]: much I'm putting per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mosquito dunks are very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available at most of your local
hardware stores or your feed stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got like a ranch store or
something around you, they've probably got
[SPEAKER_00]: them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another product known as Natrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natrol is the same ingredient as the
mosquito dunks, but it is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated and it will definitely work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use the evergreen pyrethrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will work as a drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will tell you how much evergreen to put
per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply that to your soil as a drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will remove your fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use a product called
Grandivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandivo will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the evergreen and the Grandivo
together, you will get rid of your fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats forever in two applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be preventative and you
don't want to use a beneficial bacteria or
[SPEAKER_00]: a spray pesticide, you can use
diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A diatomaceous earth has little sharp
points on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little rough textured little,
it's like little rocks or it's like really
[SPEAKER_00]: sharp rice crispies or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply a layer of that to the top of your
soil, cover the soil completely,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the bugs can't climb in and out
of there because it cuts them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kills them when they try to get in and
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want anything to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hint, wait for the soil to dry mostly
and then apply the diatomaceous earth onto
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it sit as long as you can before you
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can use to keep these
fungus gnats away is a product called
[SPEAKER_00]: spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of products that contain
spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monterey garden spray does contain
spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray that on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a soil drench with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, here's something that I should
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to use the evergreen
pyrethrums or the spinosad as a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: drench, you should also spray the foliage
because those fungus gnats are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fly out of the soil there and they're
going to land on the leaves and just chill
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and start living there for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do a soil drench,
also do a foliar application of whichever
[SPEAKER_00]: product you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the evergreen pyrethrums or if
it's the spinosad from Monterey garden
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about one more thing with
fungal gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knew this was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 100% organic way to get rid of your
fungus gnats would be fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_00]: predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to read you the name out
of this catalog, but it is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it would read hypoaspis
miles to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hypoaspis miles fungus gnats
predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll spell it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: H-Y-P-O-A-S-P-I-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the word miles, hypoaspis miles
fungus gnats predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be the beneficial insects I
would recommend to control and eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: your fungus gnats infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I feel like that pretty
much covers spider mites and fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, at the top of the
show, I know I said I was going to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover three topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I said I was going to try to get to
whiteflies, but I've been going for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time and honestly, my throat's getting a
little bit tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of faking it and just phoning
in the last half of this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make whiteflies the first
issue we deal with on the part two of how
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify, prevent and correct common
garden issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please stay tuned for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you for listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned a whole bunch about
spider mites and fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the part of
the show that I'm going to be talking
about.
I'm going to be talking about spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you feel like the show was worth a
couple of bucks or a buck or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: can contribute, I would appreciate it if
you go to patreon.com slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart and help me out if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is always going to be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you free grow lessons and
free grow advice from my heart because I
[SPEAKER_00]: love cannabis and I love helping people
and I love watching people improve their
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The look on somebody's face when they
learn a trick and they grow pot better
[SPEAKER_00]: next time, it's fucking priceless to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I do this, but it is not free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs me money to host my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs me money to buy the things that I
need for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind doing it, but if you'd like
to contribute, I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to, trying to beg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to offset the cost of the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost me over $300 for hosting per year
because I put out so much content and the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes are long and they're high
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use a lot of bandwidth and you guys
listen a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of bandwidth going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it costs me a little bit and I'm just
asking for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like I'm begging someone to wrap
it up, but patreon.com.

[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up for this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
buddy, Dr. Hambone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab,
and give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ain't got many
[SPEAKER_02]: things we need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every other day or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you, you won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say the mood ain't right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that pussy's tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to me, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her heart is still broken.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's trying to recover
[SPEAKER_02]: her ex-boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to me, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know just what I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, you ain't all my food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, you're drinking all my beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're smoking all my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You rub your ass against me.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the disco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shake that ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shake that ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked you for your number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said, hell no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always hang around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I get offended.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you come around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm tired of my organs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your organs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to me, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't play with my head again.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get it, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a lesbian?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let me lick it, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me stick it, honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you my money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, you can have it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and have a bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want, you can take them both,
baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get it, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is still the pregame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silly woman, she game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I'm a freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I play it off like a college geek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crack a smile and politely speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: With intellect.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the woman I select.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoping that she won't detect.
[SPEAKER_02]: My egotistical chauvinistical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lust I thrust till I scream like mystical.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wrong message I hope I'm not sending.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laughing and pretending my dick's not
extending.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't be overzealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: She might discover.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's walking away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blew my cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't change the subject,
baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should've fucked on our long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your telephone number is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a lot to give her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust you that dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So provocative.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see your lingerie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to bust a nut, bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must think I'm gay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to bust a nut, bitch.
I really need to bust a nut, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to bust a nut, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to bust a nut, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to bust
[SPEAKER_00]: a nut, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to bust a nut, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to bust a nut, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the shop vac will certainly work to
help you clean up spider mite webbing
[SPEAKER_00]: should it be there in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to really easily find an issue
in your garden is to be there every day
[SPEAKER_00]: and just take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody stares into the plants all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stare with a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you see any stippling.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you see little bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if bugs fly up out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if bugs fly up out of the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look around the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if anything looks out of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look and see if you have some sort of leak
or drip coming from an air conditioner or
[SPEAKER_00]: a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to find an issue early is to
look every day and pay attention and be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is go there and look
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay some attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some time in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to walk in and just pull a leaf
from a random plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to pick a different plant every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there are no bugs, no issues on
the bottom side of that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the top side of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hardly ever problems on the top
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it from far away if there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But grab some leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull them off the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look and see if you notice any
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another really easy and simple way to
prevent problems in your garden is to
[SPEAKER_00]: simply clean up after yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave leaves on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave dirt on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave your tools in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you bought some soil and you plan
on doing some transplanting, don't bring
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil into the grow room until you can
properly treat it and be sure that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are not bugs in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention that a lot of soil that
you purchase comes with free insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people complain about specific
brands having insects in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, all of the soil is eventually
stored in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever brand you choose, if it's Fox
Farms, if it's Roots Organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's whoever else, those are just the
first two I thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's brand A, brand B, and brand C,
they're all made by different companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they're all put on a truck and
they are all sent to whatever king fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro supply in whatever place and they're
all stored in one warehouse there until
[SPEAKER_00]: they're shipped out to smaller warehouses,
to smaller warehouses, to retail stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all shipped to one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that one place, I imagine it's just
a fucking bug farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every thrip and fungus net and spider mite
is just in there plotting to take over
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when new soil comes, you have to pay
attention to what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention that in the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be clean and pay the fuck attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing we should talk about,
a lot of people are like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: what about ladybugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't I use ladybugs in my garden to help
keep pests away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs are really cute, but they are not
that aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel that they eat enough
problematic bugs to be worth their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get some ladybugs, release them
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a bunch of photography because
they're really cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the next morning, get out the
shop vac and vacuum up all the dead
[SPEAKER_00]: goddamn ladybugs because most of them are
going to die within the first 24 to 48
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really not that useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in an indoor grow,
when they die, they stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You step on them, they're crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find them in your ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find them all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys, I don't really think a
praying mantis is too beneficial in a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mostly eat things like aphids and
soft bodied insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't really go after too many spider
mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't that aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is if you are going to
employ predator insects, it is way more
[SPEAKER_00]: worth your time, your budget and your
energy to research and purchase the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct predatory insect for your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every insect that I mention in these
problem episodes, I'm going to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: include a predatory insect that will
control that pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I'll do a full episode focused
on beneficial insects and predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I'll just include one or two
predators for each problem that we face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you are looking to employ and
use predator mites and sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated pest management system and go
the organic route, I can fully endorse a
[SPEAKER_00]: company called Arbico Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's A-R-B-I-C-O Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are available online at
Arbico-Organics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sponsored by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one simple catalog, this is the
early spring 2017 catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes beneficial insects and mites
to combat almost any problem I could
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine in a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are mite predators, there are
whitefly parasites, there are aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy anything from ladybugs and
praying mantises to my new pirate bugs to
[SPEAKER_00]: assassin bugs, which we will talk about in
the IPM episode, which I do have coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, my point here is
that I do completely endorse Arbico
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics because another way that you can
pay attention and notice bugs before they
[SPEAKER_00]: become a problem is yellow and blue sticky
traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said blue also, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people know about the yellow sticky
traps for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about yellow sticky traps for
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason yellow sticky traps are yellow
is because bugs are attracted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellowing leaves are a sign of
weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you are a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to eat through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thick green leaf is crunchy and it
has protection on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little more work to
get to the crunchy, juicy or that juicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty insides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaf is already yellow,
it's a little bit weak and you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: your little fangs right through it and get
in there and suck out the juices and get
[SPEAKER_00]: what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bugs are programmed to want to head for
those yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang those yellow sticky traps up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put one kind of low near the
bottom of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put one kind of in the middle of
the canopy and then I put them up high
[SPEAKER_00]: where flying bugs are going to go up near
the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to have those yellow sticky
traps around to let me know if bugs are
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I see insects gathering on
those, a couple is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a couple occasionally
because shit flies around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to have a normal bug
flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start seeing them gather on
there, it's time to treat for whatever bug
[SPEAKER_00]: you see gathering on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be a fungus net if
it's something flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue ones, put those lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue sticky cards, put those lower
near your soil and they will let you know
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're getting thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a good indicator of leaf miners
and thrips and other soil-bound insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sticky traps are certainly a good
way to let you know that insects are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another good way to know that you've
got bugs, flying bugs will stick to your
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light reflectors, they heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got glass on there, that'll heat
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere there will be bugs stuck to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see little black bugs or little
white bugs, that means you've got fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: nets or white flies that you have got to
treat for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are really simple ways and
indicators that you have got problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: very simple ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking ugly because you've got
white flies in there, you've got white fly
[SPEAKER_00]: shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really easy to identify a white
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: White fly identification, they are little
white bugs that fly around.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know they're there?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see them, the best way to
check for them, shake the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you shake the plant, shake the
foliage, white flies will take off flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, look around the
light, shake the plants and look toward
[SPEAKER_00]: the light because the little bugs want to
fly right at the light when you shake
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll just fly around for a
couple of seconds and they'll land right
[SPEAKER_00]: back on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an easy way to identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good way to prevent white flies is a
clean, dry, sealed grow room and also low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: White flies thrive and reproduce in
temperatures over 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to keep it closer to 75,
77 degrees in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will slow down the white fly
production if they do get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like I was talking about earlier,
clear out all of the plant debris that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead leaves and stuff, get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in the last episode, I talked about
using fine dust filters and HEPA filters
[SPEAKER_00]: on all of your ducting or on your intakes
or on your outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have some sort of ducting on
all your ins and outs and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your vents are covered so that the
white flies can't travel through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great ways to prevent white
flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you know how to spot them and you
know how to prevent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, should you get them, let's talk about
ways to get rid of white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about a little bit ago,
yellow sticky traps are a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: start catching the white flies,
but you're only going to get a small
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of what's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the ones that fly to the yellow
sticky traps, just the dumb ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dumb ones are going to fly right to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smart ones are going to stay there and
they're going to keep breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way that you can get rid of them
is to shake the plants and when they fly
[SPEAKER_00]: up, simply use your shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this before in gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this in personal gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done this also in commercial
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shake the shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the plant and just use the wand on
the shop vac and as they fly out,
[SPEAKER_00]: just suck them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to fly right out of the
plant and then they're going to fly right
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe keep the shop vac up toward the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just suck them right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep sucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chase them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suck them up until you're bored,
until your arms go tired or until they
[SPEAKER_00]: quit flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whichever one you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out the shop vac and shop vac the
shit out of those white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use neem oil would work to help
you get rid of your white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrethrum sprays will help you get rid of
your white flies and spinosad sprays will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you get rid of your white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all things that are up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use the evergreen pyrethrum
spray, it seems to be a very versatile
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could spray the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a soil drench and that will get
rid of most of your insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think two or three applications of the
evergreen pyrethrums will get rid of most
[SPEAKER_00]: insects to tell you the truth,
but that is up to you if it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got a very small garden
and a very light case of white flies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is safer soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ed Rosenthal makes his own type of
soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple products like that are great to use
if you've got a light infestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also keep in mind, like I mentioned in
every episode, everything you spray on
[SPEAKER_00]: your leaves is going to end up in your
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to apply essential oils
or botanical extract oils, those are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to end up in your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on making hash, if you're
making BHC, if you're making water hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff will end up in your
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up tasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have a health effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know what product you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the long-term effects of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that stuff in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you can use to get rid
of your white flies is a beneficial fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think it is pronounced buveria
bassiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beneficial fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be applied in several different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sold as a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be sprinkled onto soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be mixed with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you get it, please follow the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear a mask if you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, you guys, this is a horticultural
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be very careful with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time when we talk about the
beneficial insects that you can use to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of your white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not want to apply pesticides,
if you do not want to get out the shot
[SPEAKER_00]: vac, you guys get out the shot vac and
just suck the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beat the shit out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to apply pesticides,
if you don't want to use beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: funguses, if you don't want to put
spinosad on your plants, one thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: really can do is get whitefly parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are one, two, three different types
of whitefly parasites available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbico magazine, and they are all very
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whitefly parasite I would recommend to
you is called the Ancarcia formosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually little wasps that fly
around your greenhouse and eat the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that is my quick talk
on how to get rid of whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the best way to get rid of
whiteflies is to prevent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your clothes clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been to another grow,
keep your grow room sealed up,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your yellow sticky traps hung up,
and hopefully the little fuckers don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, one thing I should mention,
a common way that I have discovered pests
[SPEAKER_00]: in gardens is through photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a huge cannabis photography
enthusiast, a shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to follow my Instagram,
I am irey underscore genetics on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, I-R-I-E underscore
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a ton of cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my recent posts have gotten nearly
500 likes so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 480 something likes on a couple of
posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to check that out,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But photography is how I discover a lot of
issues and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll snap a picture at a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll zoom in real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll snap a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw the disc in the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll open it up on the computer screen and
zoom in thinking that I've got the most
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing shot, and then I'll notice that
there are some white flies or some fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats or some aphids just crunched up in a
corner on one of these buds that I did not
[SPEAKER_00]: even notice, and it ruined my photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least now I know that there's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something I need to treat for,
something I need to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a good camera,
if you've got a decent camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could probably do this with your
iPhone or Android camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you suspect you've got a problem,
take some pictures, zoom in, look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures when you zoom in, and you may
reveal some problems you were unaware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
17 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I'm going to take a couple of
giant dabs, and then I will be right back,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are going to talk about aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back,
and I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed the music we were
listening to during the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: The song I played was called Fat Spliffs
by a band called Slightly Stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of my reggae friends are
familiar with Slightly Stupid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you haven't heard of them,
check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you will dig them.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the break, you guys, I took some
gigantic dabs of some distillate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to talk about how much I enjoy
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter is probably the most
cost-effective way for me to medicate the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take large dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I get more medicinal effect
off of one giant dab than I would three
[SPEAKER_00]: little dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took the same amount of hash,
if you took, let's just say a half gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would smoke a half gram dab by itself
instead of breaking it into three small
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I smoked those three small
dabs back to back, like inhale,
[SPEAKER_00]: blow it out, heat the rig up again,
do it again, blow out the dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat the rig up again, smoke it in,
blow it out, do it again, I think those
[SPEAKER_00]: three dabs back to back would not get me
as high as one single half gram dab would
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took the same half grab, broke it
down into three pieces, took them all,
[SPEAKER_00]: or took one giant dab, I'd get way better
medication off of the half gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to take giant dabs and I like to
do it frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take two or three dabs at a time
when I take a dab break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll take four or five dabs at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shatter is the most cost-effective way
for me to get the medicine I need for the
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take big dabs very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I need a little extra,
when I just want to do something extra to
[SPEAKER_00]: my head, you guys, this distillate is the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit expensive, so you can't
get down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't spoil yourself every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to spend a little
extra money at the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend a nice glass vial of
distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I like to do, I heat up the
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heat the banger a little bit too hot,
or the nail, whichever you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The e-nail is already on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it to a little bit hot and then let
it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just take the torch and just
barely heat the tip of the glass syringe,
[SPEAKER_00]: which the distillate comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just barely tap the plunger
and it'll just push.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think three drops of distillate is a
good dab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I like to go four or five if I'm
trying to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go big, go like seven or
eight or 10 drops of the distillate into
[SPEAKER_00]: the banger and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think one or two drops, two or three
drops would get most people choking and
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really starting to fall in love with
distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, I'm going to quit rambling about
distillate and concentrates, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids are very common in cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love warm environments and warm
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you find them in a lot of ganja
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you find them in a lot of
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about identifying aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids are about the size of a piece of
rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen aphids plenty of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a piece of rice,
maybe just a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pear shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids come in many different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have seen aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen white aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen orange aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen green aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen aphids that are a reddish brown
color, almost the color of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids come in many different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids like to hang out on the bottom
sides of your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they like to congregate at the
bottom sides of the leaves, usually kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of where they've got some protection where
they can hide from predators and light and
[SPEAKER_00]: you and the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen aphids right where the bud,
at the top bud, where the leaves come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bud and kind of make like a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves were coming out of the bud and
curling up because the bud was really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right in that little chilling area
where the leaves and bud made contact,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a nice little colony of aphids
just chilling and living right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long they had been there,
but they were there for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: because there were a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aphids like to hang out in a lot of
different places on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check often and they also
breed very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're paying attention for
aphids also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids, the problem with aphids is they
are leaf suckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to bite into your leaf and suck
out the juices, just like all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: damn pests for your gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get up under the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They poke little holes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start sucking out the leaf juices and
all the life out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants start looking like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your plants are getting weak and
they're susceptible to other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also going to yield less.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times if an aphid problem gets
out of control, you'll start seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves start to curl and wilt and look
like they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just giving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have been beat to shit and
they've been chewed up by the aphids so
[SPEAKER_00]: bad that they're not even going to try to
fight anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to curl up and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how to prevent yourself
from getting aphids in your ganja garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most other pests, we can avoid
getting them by having filtration,
[SPEAKER_00]: dust filters, and HEPA filters on your
intake and your outgoing vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need a clean grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about a clean grow room,
but every leaf, every piece of debris is a
[SPEAKER_00]: place for a bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also something you can really think
about for aphids, you need clean clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go on a hike, if you were around
plants outside, if it is warm,
[SPEAKER_00]: please change your clothes before you go
into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my coworkers talked about taking
their dog for a hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They posted pictures on Instagram all
about taking their dog for a hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stopped by the grow to say hello and
see if we wanted lunch on their way home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three days later, that garden had aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I don't want to blame that dog
for running through a bush, getting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: car, putting aphids on my friend,
my friend coming to the grow and putting
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, you can tell in my heart
that that's what I think fucking happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do not go to a grow after you've
been out hiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not come to a grow after you've been
playing with your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pets are huge carriers of
garden pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there running and rounding
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're low to the ground where the bugs
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the garden pests are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rubbing up against plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are where plant pests live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to bring home predatory
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to bring home spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to bring home thrips and
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be very careful with your
clothing, your shoes, and your pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good way to prevent aphids in your
garden is to check for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if they're already there,
you're going to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to prevent an infestation is to
check for them very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to check and prevent
any type of pest infestation is to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One sign that you have got an aphid
problem is ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got ants in your grow room,
you have probably got aphids also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants and aphids often come together in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got one, you've probably got
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants are easy to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to write it down right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about ways to eradicate aphids
should they show up in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we talk about this quite
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step that you can do if you
choose to is you can spray products on
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many things you can spray for
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about, of course,
the obvious neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem oil will get rid of the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aphids don't want to hang out on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of applications of neem oil
should get rid of your aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're in flower, you do not
want to spray neem oil on flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, I say it all the time,
everything you spray on your buds and your
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves is going to end up in your
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big fat swollen buds,
they're going to act like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spray neem oil on there
and it's going to absorb and hang on to a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of neem you're going to concentrate
it and you'll actually see the neem oil
[SPEAKER_00]: float on the top of your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have to think about what you're
going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make a lot of
concentrates, these sprays may not be for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to use sprays,
pyrethrum sprays work well to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, of course, have been endorsing the
Evergreen brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another brand that's quite
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing as Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use cinnamon oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use clove oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a product made by Ed Rosenthal
called Zero Tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these products will help you to get
rid of your aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you to choose how strongly you
want to attack these pests and also how
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh of a chemical you want to apply to
the plants that you are loving and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are growing to use as medicine for
yourself or other people that you care
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another method we can use to get rid of
our aphids is a beneficial fungus called
[SPEAKER_00]: Buveria bassiana, which is actually sold
as a product called Botanagard 22WP,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's spelled B-O-T-N-I-G-A-R-D,
and it's 22WP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit expensive, but it will
certainly work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the beneficial fungus I keep
speaking of that can be applied to treat a
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of garden insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you can find it, of course,
at Arbeco-Organics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize it would be for sale on
that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not looking for it on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a quick Google search to see where
we could purchase it so I could share it
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, and the first place that came up
was Arbeco Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm sure they will not sponsor
me because I'm a cannabis podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let them know if you do shop with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know that you heard about them
through the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: through Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've talked about how to get rid of
these aphids on your plants if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in flower and you've got giant
buds, I would never recommend spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: products on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray something that's
going to leave a flavor or possibly cause
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of long-lasting health effect
that we don't even know about for years to
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you don't want to spray the plants,
what's the next option?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to bring out the predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is where ladybugs are
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs do love to eat this shit out of
aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a really cool picture in
Ed Rosenthal's book of a ladybug just
[SPEAKER_00]: devouring an aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is where the ladybugs do come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs are actually useful for getting
rid of your aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the praying mantis I discredited
earlier, he is actually really good at
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the ladybugs, the praying mantis,
those would be the first steps to getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of aphids in your cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you can bring out aphid parasites
and aphid predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phidias colimani is a well-known aphid
parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several aphid predators
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them prefer certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're going to work with the
predators and the parasites, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got the proper and appropriate
conditions for these insects so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can thrive and destroy your aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do that is
completely free and completely organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's safe and simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can simply remove leaves or you can
remove buds that are infested with bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop it off, put it in a trash bag,
seal the trash bag, put that in a sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: trash can away from the grow, and you will
have manually eliminated the problem from
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to mention that I
forgot to write down, but I just thought
[SPEAKER_00]: of it as I was talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, I have seen aphids on the
stems of cannabis plants, moving up and
[SPEAKER_00]: down, just traveling around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A product called stylet oil will coat the
stems of the plants and it will leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: like an undesirable place for these aphids
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, check out a product called stylet oil,
dilute it heavily, apply it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and that will keep away most of
your garden pests, especially these
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cannabis community,
I want to thank you for listening to part
[SPEAKER_00]: two of preventing, identifying,
and eradicating common garden pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we've only covered insects,
but once we cover the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis pest insects, we are going to
work our way into identifying other
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in the garden, such as plants
that are too dry and too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll teach you how to identify overfed and
underfed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about calcium and magnesium
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of things planned for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you subscribe and stick around for
part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
