[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 413 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.

[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Tropicana
Cookies Fambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at the Ambrosia Days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really lucky to score a 4 gram jar
of this amazing concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it contains 72.4% THC and a
total of 85% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a big chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me kind of sit back in the chair
for a couple of minutes, but once that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial punch to the face wore off,
it has got me in a really good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I am going to read a couple of listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails, but before we get there,
I owe a couple of people some shoutouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shoutout to my friend
Tyler Radke, how about a big shoutout to
[SPEAKER_00]: John Milk, another big shoutout to Joseph
Gata, a big shoutout to Keith Klump,
[SPEAKER_00]: how about a big shoutout to my friend
Artem Zirinov, and of course a shoutout to
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate all of the Patreon
support and if you would like to learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to become a patron and get a Patreon
shoutout at the start of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you need to do is go to Patreon.com
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you need to sign up
will be right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that in this episode, I was going
to read some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first email goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Jeff, I wanted to start off
by saying that your podcasts are the best
[SPEAKER_00]: hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate that great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate hearing that people think
I am the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in it for competition,
but it always feels good knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, So I have a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am starting my second grow using roots
organic soil and Canna Vega organic
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements, which worked great on my
first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, congrats on the first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that worked out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He continues to say I am growing in a four
foot by three foot by six foot tent with
[SPEAKER_00]: two HLG V2 288 LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've got a good visual of
your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any way to diagnose a problem
or help me figure out what you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: going on, give me a good description of
your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good visual of what's happening
in this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, So I am growing two
pineapple express by fast buds and one
[SPEAKER_00]: pink Kush CBD by Seed's Mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: All are auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told by a few people that it's not
safe with my other plants since this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 to one CBD plant and can affect my two
pineapples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how, but has me concerned
with their background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how that would make a
difference since they are all auto
[SPEAKER_00]: females, but I have heard hemp plants
being an issue with pollinating non CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants just started veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I separate them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, Thanks Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and hug your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign their name from BAFSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to BAFSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a really great setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like and you've got some quality
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two pineapple express in there
from fast buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got one pink Kush CBD from Seed's
Man who is also another reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far everything should work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were told by people that it is not
safe to have your CBD plants with your not
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you said you're not sure that it
makes a difference because they are all
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have no chance of pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have heard that hemp plants being an
issue with pollinating non CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be possible if you had a male,
but you don't have any males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a male to create pollen or you
need to do some reversing or some
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing to cause a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got three solid females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way that your CBD plants are
going to affect your non CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nothing to worry about in your
indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were in an outdoor
environment, those plants would be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive pollen from cannabis or hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were a male hemp plant or a male
cannabis plant somewhere in the vicinity
[SPEAKER_00]: and some wind picked up some pollen or a
bird picked up some pollen or an insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our pollinator friends grabbed some
pollen traveled from that male plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: to your female auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they could be pollinated that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we need a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a pollinator plant to add pollen
to your females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you've got three females unless
you introduce some pollen you will be just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely understand what you're
asking and I hope I have answered your
[SPEAKER_00]: question thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, you've got three girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the pollen going to come from that
is going to pollinate these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You either need a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to reverse a female or you need
one of those females to hermaphrodite due
[SPEAKER_00]: to stress or poor breeding, which is
always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what we're talking about
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about you've got three
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are not going to have any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me elaborate a little on this
subject because something that I see
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the near future is a very
realistic concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people in many places are growing
large scale outdoor hemp projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those same areas, people are growing
large scale outdoor cannabis projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Department of Ag and horticulture
experts and other people will argue this
[SPEAKER_00]: statement, but currently what we are
deciding on what differentiates your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from your hemp is basically a lab
test at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're finished, dried and cured
product, the product that is tested by the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, if that product contains point three
percent THC, you have got a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that product contains less than point
three percent THC, you have got a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in all reality, there is nothing
stopping a cannabis plant from receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing stopping a hemp plant
from receiving cannabis pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got a lot of new farmers that are
jumping on the hemp and CBD bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're buying big chunks of land,
which may be right next to our medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're setting up their hemp farm in
that same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these people are growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of new seed breeders and
vendors in the hemp game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure many of those seeds are
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that a lot of people are selling
feminized seeds that are not done
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is a safe guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: To predict that in the very near future,
some of these outdoor hemp fields are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to miss a male and we are
going to pollinate some of our outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and recreational cannabis crops
with rogue pollen from hemp that came from
[SPEAKER_00]: another farm from an irresponsible farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it will happen in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing stopping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that we can do
agriculturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can set up barriers kind of nature
wise, but it's not going to stop every
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't stop a pollinator insect or a
pollinator bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't stop all of the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bet that in the very near future,
we are going to see outdoor cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp crops that are kind of not destroyed,
but partially ruined because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by irresponsible farmers that
did not identify and cull the males in
[SPEAKER_00]: their outdoor hemp or cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could happen in a hemp or a cannabis
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of assuming it's going to be more
common in a hemp field because that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more new of an industry to a
lot of people, but this is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Basta, I do not believe that this is
an issue you need to worry about in your
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a male plant, so nothing is
going to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basta wraps up this message by saying,
thanks Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like supporting the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you find me to be a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, take a fat dab and hug
your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab and I promise
you I'll give mama a hug the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Basta, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, thank you for doing
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said you make the world a little
better, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I appreciate those kinds of
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on and says, my question is
about how to rejuvenate a flowered plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an amazing Jamaican blueberry that
I do not have clones of and I would love
[SPEAKER_00]: to save.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have definitely taken a clone of
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I always take clones off of my
cultivars before they flower, but
[SPEAKER_00]: something weird happened with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all of a sudden started flowering in
the veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, I thought I had received some
auto flower seeds by mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing that other plants from the same
seeds in different parts of the veg room
[SPEAKER_00]: were not flowering, I investigated
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a nearby plant of a different
cultivar, supposedly feminized,
[SPEAKER_00]: had hermaphrodited and developed just one
small set of pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my understanding that if pollen
sacks show up in a veg room, they can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause female plants in the veg room to
start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that is what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would strongly disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think, I do not believe,
I do not understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think that a hermaphrodited plant
in that room would encourage the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe that pollen sacks from
your hermaphroditic, feminized plant are
[SPEAKER_00]: what caused your other female plants in
that veg room to begin to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would strongly disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: From your message, what I strongly believe
has happened is you do not have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light in your veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've either got too little light,
not enough intensity, or you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong spectrum, or perhaps the light is
too far from the canopy, or even you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the plants too squished together and
they're just frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess that that one feminized
cultivar that you found the hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers on, I'm going to guess it is in
the corner, it is furthest from the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that hermaphrodite flower is somewhere
near the bottom where it is not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing that decides when a plant
flowers is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you believe you do not have auto
flowers, and we are seeing that some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in your room are flowering and some
are not, so that leads me to believe you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next contributing factor that decides
when your plants flower is light,
[SPEAKER_00]: light interval, light intensity,
light duration, is it all dialed in?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're telling me that these plants are
starting to flower while they are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads me to believe that you don't have
enough light in there, and those select
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that are flowering just have a
little bit different light sensitivity
[SPEAKER_00]: than the phenotypes which have not chosen
to flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first question is going to be what
kind of light are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: How intense is that light?
[SPEAKER_00]: How close to the canopy is that light
fixture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to know what is your light
schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many hours per day are you running
that light?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the plants reacting to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're obviously trying to flower,
so I don't think they're getting enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you've got two Jamaican blueberry
plants in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where those plants came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the environment in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the photo period in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants want bright, intense,
long daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants probably expect really
bright, long, hot days, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not getting that in your grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as they are nearing completion,
as fate would have it, the one I could not
[SPEAKER_00]: get clones to root looks unbelievable,
which leads me back to my original
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you help me rejuvenate this plant
after flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a podcast number that discusses
this topic, or is there any other advice
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can give?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you in advance, signed TJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, TJ, I don't remember if I have done a
rejuvenation episode, so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to search for that right quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I get back, I'll let you
know what number it was, if I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, we're going to talk about
rejuvenating and revegging your Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it a quick check and I have done a
revegging episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode on revegging
our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is episode number 152.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I go into great detail in that
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more about
revegging your flowered cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend revisiting episode 152.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are here now and you are asking the
question today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk really briefly a quick
lesson on revegging flowered cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may sound crazy, but success
successful revegging, simple successful
[SPEAKER_00]: revegging starts late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start flushing approximately two
weeks before harvest, I suggest you turn
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights back to 24 hours on and zero
hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's head just blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to flush our plants and
you're telling this person to put his
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on 24 hours on and zero hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are so late in the flowering cycle
that we are not going to disrupt the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are about to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as we see any problems,
we're going to chop the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to reverse the hormones in this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is full on an old lady mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is at the end of its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to convince this plant that it
wants to go from old lady back to a young
[SPEAKER_00]: girl so that we can start fresh with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way we can do that is to make
this plant think it is a different season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make this plant think that it
is spring and it is time to start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to put the light cycle in a
spring type condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want this plant to sleep at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when the flowering is induced as
during those dark cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to leave it on as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours of the most intense light you can
give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can put it under a thousand watt
light, that is where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours a day of a thousand watt light
for our revege process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start that 14 days before you intend to
harvest your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flush this plant just like you're
flushing the rest of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do everything just like you would except
we want the lights on for 24 hours on and
[SPEAKER_00]: zero hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in harvest comes harvest almost like
you would any other harvest except we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to leave the bottom two or four or maybe
six little tiny popcorn buds on this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need much here to revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less is better when it comes to trying
to revege a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got it on 24 hours for two weeks
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chop down the majority of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We leave four little tiny buds on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe six, maybe eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a bunch of little buds on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a lot to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got these little buds on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave those on that 24 hour light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them a heavy vege mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need minimal amounts of phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend high doses of kelp and
of course a lot of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil that root ball has been around
for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can pot it into a larger pot
without causing damage, that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it in a bigger pot if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed it some strong veg newts with a lot
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I recommend a kelp product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like liquid karma or something
in that vein would work wonderfully for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it on a 24 hour light cycle until you
see those buds start producing normal
[SPEAKER_00]: looking leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: For several weeks that plant is going to
kick out weird, weird looking leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be spun around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look like a claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be the right shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to be expected for several,
several weeks, depending on your cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the plant you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revegging this plant could take you six,
maybe eight weeks from the time you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep watching those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, it will grow out of that
little bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little bud right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bud is going to develop new leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start stacking up and getting
taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: New growth will come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, that new growth will start to
look like a normal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will look like what we expect and what
we're hoping for and what we are familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got that nice, healthy,
familiar growth happening, then I suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: you take a clone from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got several healthy tops on that
plant and you are not a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner, maybe only take one or two clones
and leave one or two behind in case you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have good luck with your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got that good growth coming
out of the plant, it is time to clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take one or two clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those become the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to run those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I would grow that out and I
would take five or six clones off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be the next crop that I
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's recap real quickly my revegging
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts approximately two weeks before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your lights on a 24 hour on and zero
hours off light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at harvest time, chop it down,
but leave a few bottom buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere between two and eight bottom
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how big of a plant you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave some stuff on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave that part in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it on a 24 hour light cycle with as
much light as you can give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue to feed it a heavy veg feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a lot of nitrogen and again,
a kelp product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it on that veg cycle until you see
it starting to produce normal looking
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it grow a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's got those normal leaves,
the longer the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then clone that good looking growth
and that clone becomes your new mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that to take clones from and grow
those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should not see any loss in quality
or vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no what is known as genetic
drift, which we have disproven on this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a term that applies in this
situation in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my quick review on how to
revege our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't forget that you had problems
cloning this specific cultivar in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to be extra careful when you
were cloning at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would it not clone last time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what the issue was?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your last chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get clones off of it this
time, it is time to let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be wasting too much time,
space, and energy in this plant if it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make this one count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done entire episodes on producing
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an episode on cutting clones
into rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an episode on cutting clones in
an easy clone machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need help cutting clones,
I recommend checking out those episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My most recent cutting clone episode is
number 364.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend that one before you
try cutting clones again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not disrespecting your clone tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying maybe a little bit of
advice will help you out since you had
[SPEAKER_00]: troubles with this specific cultivar in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really hate to see you revege and take
all of that time and then not even be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a living clone off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe check out that cutting clones
episode again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is number 364.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I hope I answered your
question, JT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I may have called you TJ at the start
of the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I got your name wrong.
