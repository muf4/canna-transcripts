[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 147 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm starting this podcast off
kind of bummed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm disappointed in myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm disappointed in technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I recorded a marvelous podcast
with the dab and granny with Brett from
[SPEAKER_01]: Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course our friend Lindsay,
the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: This evening, I pulled out my zoom age
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took out my trusty memory card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw it in my Mac book and the files
are all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can grab the files and I can move them
to my Mac book.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason, none of that shit is
playable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of the material that I recorded
with dab and granny will be aired on this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast unless one of my tech savvy
friends is able to get this SD card and
[SPEAKER_01]: pull this information off of there in a
usable format because so far I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I did was frustrate myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not able to get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me turn down the music and say this
a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, the dab and granny podcast that
I recorded is lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available on her Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a Facebook live video of it,
but I think that's the only way you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hear or see any of that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology fucked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news is the podcast is lost and
gone for fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology ate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology kicked my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't win every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news, however, is that dab and
granny has got to come back to the show
[SPEAKER_01]: and Brett's got to come back and Lindsay
has to come back and we have to do another
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I want to do a podcast with granny
by herself and with Brett by himself and
[SPEAKER_01]: then a podcast with the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Together, I think granny should be on the
podcast kind of frequently because she has
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of great shit to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually think granny needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had so much to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encouraged her to start her own podcast
was something that I actually said when
[SPEAKER_01]: she was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I advertise that like we're going to have
an amazing episode for you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be the episode that you
expected, but I'm going to do my best to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody that was on the episode that
fucked up, I invite you guys all to come
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hung out at the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked so much hash that it was
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a few friends stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: By pop D and chosen one, uh, pop D glass
art and chosen one glass art showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hung out with us, took some dabs,
uh, Aaron hung out for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to everybody that tried to
make that podcast happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move forward and quit talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about some positive things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, more positive stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, the other night, I got to see
Joey Coco Diaz at comedy works in downtown
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know anything about me,
you know that I love comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also know that I love comedy works in
downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that comedy works downtown is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the best comedy club on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's the second, it's the second best
to the comedy store in Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, comedy works is the best
comedy club in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since I'm talking about comedy,
you guys, I saw Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of my, that might be my
favorite damn comedian right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude blew the roof off of comedy
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, Joey Diaz walked out on stage
and he grabbed the mic before he could get
[SPEAKER_01]: to the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey walked out to a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grabbed the mic and he said,
uh, what up you bad motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the way Joey starts the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew it was going to be a party from
then he had this little strut in his
[SPEAKER_01]: stride the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey was killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the show was hosted by a comedian
whose name I cannot recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a new guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a very entertaining dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a, another comedian whose name
I cannot remember who was the opening act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there was a feature act whose name
was Rick, who I've seen several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did say everyone's trying to do a bunch
of weed jokes in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, if you're a comedian and
aspiring comedian, a touring comedian,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a funny guy and you're coming to
Colorado, chill out on the weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard every fucking weed joke you're
going to tell unless you got some super
[SPEAKER_01]: creative weed joke, but we've heard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for the pros.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for the noobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard all the weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the opening acts, they both,
all three did a couple of weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The host did a couple of weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey barely talked about weed,
but Joey smokes more weed than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey eats more edibles than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joey still is able to go on stage and
put out an amazing fucking comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey had me laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joey Coco Diaz, you guys, he is the
host of a podcast called the church of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in a movie called the longest yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's an amazing comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's Joe Rogan's favorite comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that tells you anything, he had me
laughing so hard that the sides of my
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach and ribs were hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: My back was hurting in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_01]: My cheeks hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little spot like right behind
where my sunglasses would rest on my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like someone was just squeezing my
head and it was from laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I told my buddy, I was like,
I'm laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Joey might've hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard me because when he heard,
I was going to, when he heard that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to cry, I think he just started
hitting harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Oh, you're laughing now
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I had tears coming out of my left eye,
my right eye was twitching weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't laughed that hard in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably won't laugh that hard
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Joey was fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He blew the roof off of comedy works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love to Joey Coco Diaz, much love to
comedy works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also a big special thank you to my
friend Baker Baker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate what you do for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always treated like a VIP at comedy
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also shout out to my friend Buzzy for,
uh, buying the tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I got a sweet deal with my buddy
Buzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he buys tickets and I drive,
uh, and then we go see comedy shows and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fucking amazingly fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my new friends that I made
that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about other positive things
that happened in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night, you guys, I got to see one of
my favorite bands, Joseph Israel and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerusalem band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in my hometown of Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were 10 minutes away from my house at
the Bruce ale house.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I had to do was drive over there,
find parking, march on in and get my
[SPEAKER_01]: reggae on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was local.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, shout out to the Bruce ale house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That club is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the best venue in Pueblo
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there are a couple of theaters they
compete, but I'm going to give that place
[SPEAKER_01]: the number one venue for the vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they got a back door that rolls up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right on the river walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the river right behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the sound is good in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vibe is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The band, oh my goodness, Joseph Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the band tore it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I've been seeing Joseph Israel
for probably, I've been watching his band
[SPEAKER_01]: for probably 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, I've seen several of their
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen this band progress and come a
long, long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last night's show was the best show
that I've ever seen them do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the second to last show on their
tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could tell that they just played
until they were done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight's show, they're not going to have
a lot of energy because they wore
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves out last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever sees them tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drained all their energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my favorite album from Joseph Israel
is an album called gone are the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was his original release.
[SPEAKER_01]: They played, uh, there were probably 15
songs on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a couple of them are like dub
remixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like probably 10 songs on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must've played seven or eight of them
and they played all my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could yell out a song and they would
play it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't going to play a song called
truth, but truth is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a break, you know,
when the musicians are like tuning their
[SPEAKER_01]: guitars and they're all talking and taking
a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I yelled out truth and I was like right in
the front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joseph looked at me like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they talked about it for a minute
and they said, we haven't played this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't practice this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't played this since we recorded
the gone are the days album.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started singing the chorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just started doing like a really cool
acapella harmony version of the chorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once that chorus ended,
the guitar player started playing the
[SPEAKER_01]: guitar lick and they played the song truth
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it wasn't tight and it wasn't perfect,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful that my friends tried to
play that song for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much love to Joseph Israel and the
Jerusalem band and the entire crew at
[SPEAKER_01]: bruise ale house at an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smoke after the show with a
couple of the guys, uh, something I should
[SPEAKER_01]: mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been a huge fan of a bass player by
the name of Chris Meredith.
[SPEAKER_01]: He plays with Joseph Israel and the
Jerusalem band, but he's also known as a
[SPEAKER_01]: recording artist in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also well known for playing with
Steven Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I walked into the building and Chris
Meredith was just standing there talking
[SPEAKER_01]: to Joseph Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized he was going to be the base
player for the show that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put a huge smile on my face because
he recorded Joseph's album with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went on tour for the first tour and
then he had to go back to Jamaica and he
[SPEAKER_01]: took off for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't see him on tour with Joseph.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great to see Chris and the original
drummer back together in the rhythm
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got to meet the original
keyboard player from the gun or the day's
[SPEAKER_01]: album.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to talk about the recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to talk about a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to talk about the tough gun recording
studio in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice to hang out with some
Jamaican Rastas, some, uh, some faithful
[SPEAKER_01]: folks, folks with good vibes, uh,
folks with positive energy with good
[SPEAKER_01]: things to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I recommend that you listen to
Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just talked about it for like five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to move on from that,
but big shout out, much love, much
[SPEAKER_01]: respect, much good vibes from Joseph
Israel and the Jerusalem band last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the friend that went with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fun dancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to laugh at some, uh, some crazy
drunk people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, man, drunk people are super
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so glad I do not consume alcohol
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just smoke mad cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there may have been a little smoke
session in the back of the club at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move on to some grow
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys been talking about my weekend and
my week long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few episodes back, I was asked how to
handle grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've noticed is everybody is
getting bombarded with grasshoppers and
[SPEAKER_01]: their outdoor cannabis grow this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one way that you can get rid of
your grasshoppers is just to clean up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can mow all the grass, mow all the
weeds, get rid of anywhere for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: live, get rid of all the stuff for them to
eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grasshoppers won't want to come
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that your neighbors probably
have a big ass pile of grass and leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit in their yard that you cannot do
anything about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal to go over there with the
torch and just burn that shit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're having problems with
grasshoppers, somebody recommended to me
[SPEAKER_01]: garlic and fermented garlic sprays to help
keep grasshoppers and other pests away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume that this would work on most
insects and most living creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ferment some garlic or mush garlic
up into a spray and spray that around your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants on and or around your plants and on
the perimeter of your plants, most bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to stay away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely you will not have any
vampires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're worried about vampires in the
garden, you could double up on the garlic
[SPEAKER_01]: spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the person that told me
about fermented garlic sprays and using
[SPEAKER_01]: them in my garden to keep away
grasshoppers outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't grow outdoors myself very
much, but a lot of our friends do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the next episode may
feature our buddy Jesse, and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk about some outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this, call me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's plan this episode so we can get it
recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll record it at my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll use my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't use the Zoom H6 because I'm
paranoid of that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid it's going to break and not
record the damn show again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably won't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some emails here in my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have asked some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys ask great questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a shout out to everybody
that sends me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to read all of the
questions over time on the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm a little bit backed up,
so I'm going to have to record more
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, here's an email that came from,
let's see, how did he sign it?
[SPEAKER_01]: He signed it Mazar420.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Mazar420.
[SPEAKER_01]: His email says, hoping you can read my
questions on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been loving the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps me get through my day at a mind
numbing job with robots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you work with robots or just like,
people who are unaware and people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: programmed to act like robots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he said, questions for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you flip to 12-12 or 11-13 DJ short
style, how long till you want to go from
[SPEAKER_01]: metal halide to HPS?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to talk about this 12-12 or
11-13 DJ short style thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Mazar420 is asking is when I change
my light cycle from my vegetative stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: either 24 hours on or an 18-6 cycle,
or maybe a 16-8, depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I change my light cycle, to my
flowering phase, which would normally be
[SPEAKER_01]: 12-12, or he says the 11-13 DJ short
style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me talk about that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ short is a well-known breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an author.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is well-educated and very passionate
about the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ short breeds amazing strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is known for the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ short bred the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something in DJ short's catalog
that you have smoked and you have enjoyed
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from old DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now DJ does a trick when he's flowering
his plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does not run them for 12 on,
12 off.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does 11 hours on and 13 hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: His theory on this is that you will see
broader variance in phenotypical
[SPEAKER_01]: expression from your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a breeder and you're looking
for phenotypes, this extra hour really
[SPEAKER_01]: lets the plants express themselves and
show the variation and show their
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also will save you one hour of
electricity over a 65-day cycle which is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be 65 hours, kilowatt hours that
you're not spending on your lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to be an hour resting off
of your air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to, some people think it
increases their yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like what it did to some of my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like what it did to some of my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very plant specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strain specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not experimented enough to know,
but a lot of people in the community are
[SPEAKER_01]: switching to the 11-13 method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It saves money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It saves time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got the right varietals,
it will work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've noticed, some of my heavier
sativas didn't like it in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took them a while to get used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked my sativas on 12-12 and then
toward the end of the phase, that's when I
[SPEAKER_01]: would start dropping down the timers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't seem to really like it when I
went 13 hours of darkness right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that catches us up to speed on the DJ
Short 11-13 method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he says, how long, once you do this
flip, do you want to go from metal
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight to HPS?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his first part of his question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I let it go 10 to 14 days
rocking the metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see the buds starting to form,
when I see those little pre buds and the
[SPEAKER_01]: pre flowers just starting to pop up and
they're getting the little dandelions,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's usually when I switch in that bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to go crazy,
do it three weeks because I think when you
[SPEAKER_01]: flip, those plants are going to stretch
for about three weeks and keeping that
[SPEAKER_01]: halide bulb in there really, I think helps
prevent them from stretching so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that halide in there for 10 to 14
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go extreme, go 21 days,
but you may slow down bud development at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to switch it in there about that
14th day because that's when my buds are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that you can utilize that I've
done and had great success with is mix and
[SPEAKER_01]: match spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a little bit of metal halide and use a
little bit of HPS if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a, I've got a reflector,
it's called the Groszilla and I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: used it in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should fire it up and do some
experiments with it just for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this reflector holds two bulbs and
they say not to put more than a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: watt total in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may say 1200 watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could put two 600 bulbs in this one
reflector.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did, I put a 600 watt high pressure
sodium and a 400 watt metal halide in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and hung that bulb in a five by five
hydro hut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put nine three gallon pots under
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I grew some of the most
photogenic and most aromatic, most
[SPEAKER_01]: flavorful and most potent cannabis I have
ever grown came from that five by five hut
[SPEAKER_01]: with that mixed spectrum light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some very impressive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem was it didn't harvest
what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wished it would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I use a thousand watt HPS in one of
those huts with proper ducting and venting
[SPEAKER_01]: and air conditioning, I can pull a pound
and a half really close to two pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to hit two pounds in those huts
because you're really limited on height
[SPEAKER_01]: and space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to like top them out and pull
them out real far and train them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can get a pound and a half out of
one of those huts.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did the HPS metal halide combo,
I got right about a pound and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't do what I would expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that 600 watt light kind of didn't
let it push, but the flavor and the aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: and the potency made up for the lack of
weight because it was for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing it from my own head stash,
so I didn't need a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first part of your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do it somewhere between 14 and 21
days, 10 days if you're trying to go
[SPEAKER_01]: early, 14 days is about ideal,
21 days if you're really trying to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants short because that halide
lamp is going to keep them from stretching
[SPEAKER_01]: on you as part of why we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he also says, also was wondering how
long once under 12, 12, do you wait to
[SPEAKER_01]: switch your nutrients from veg to bloom?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he also says, hope to hear my
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get answered on the show, sincerely
Mazer420.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's wondering how long from the day we
switched to 12, 12, do we wait to switch
[SPEAKER_01]: our nutrients from veg to bloom?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of do a slow transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that your plant is going to
absorb somewhere between 80 and 90% of its
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen that all of it's going to absorb
through its whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to absorb most of that through
the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you hit flowering, once you get to
that second or third week of flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to use a whole lot of
nitrogen, just enough to keep the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: green and keep the plant moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen is going to kind of fizzle
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can switch the nutrients right away
if you'd like to, or you can keep those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients going slowly and taper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got grow and you've got
bloom, maybe go seven to 10 days with that
[SPEAKER_01]: grow before you pull out the grow nutrient
and throw in the bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can just switch right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on the strains also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue really likes to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of stick with my veg nutrients
for an extra week or two with the gorilla
[SPEAKER_01]: glue, things like flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow doesn't require a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow will just grow like a son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll switch flow right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go 12, 12, that day they get fed
their bloom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start getting, basically your first
day of bloom nutrients aren't very far off
[SPEAKER_01]: from your last week of veg nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shouldn't be too abrupt of a switch
either way, but somewhere between that
[SPEAKER_01]: first day and about seven to 10 days in is
when I will totally have switched from veg
[SPEAKER_01]: to bloom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on the room,
the strain, the brand of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm using botanical or bottled newts,
my switch from my veg stage to my flower
[SPEAKER_01]: phase, like I said, is not very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Kalmag, liquid karma, and maybe a
little bit of, what else am I using in
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium silicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there wouldn't be a whole lot else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a dog resting on my feet and I
just moved my foot and kicked him right in
[SPEAKER_01]: the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, puppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to do that, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Mick the dog,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mick the dog's been hanging out with me
for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a cool ass dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys would like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I just kicked you right in the
head, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone on the show hears me apologizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do it again, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, my veg newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be some, what did I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Base nutrients, which would be the
Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you've got some Kalmag in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit of liquid karma and
then some potassium silicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically my veg mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would add something in there for roots,
some sort of root inoculate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use whatever you would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use either the Plus Life from Veg
Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use the Rhizo mix that
Botanicare makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use, what am I thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one product I'm really thinking I
can't say the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG BioWare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use some OG BioWare on that bitch to get
your roots going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So add that to it for roots and you got
pretty much everything you need there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Week one of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You basically want to feed the same thing
that you've been feeding for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks of veg because your plants
are just going to start transitioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So week one, you've got the option at week
one to switch out that Pure Blend Pro Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Bloom formula, or you can do it at
the start of week two, or definitely do it
[SPEAKER_01]: by week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants aren't going to need that much
nitrogen by week three, and if you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: going with the grow formula, you may burn
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go the first week or two with
your grow newts, and then by week three,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely switch all the way into your
flowering newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to add everything by week
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't need a lot at week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start introducing things slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe get some sugars in there at week
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot at week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: By week four, five, and six, that's where
things really start cracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you're going to want to start
adding bud boosters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're going to use to make the
weight a little thicker, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to use to sweeten it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, five, and six is when all that shit
comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're running a strain that likes a
lot of nitrogen, keep those nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that base grow newt coming for the
first couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a strain that's got plenty
of nutrients, if your leaves are nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: lush green, if they're dark green,
don't even worry about that grow newt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and switch it over to the Bloom
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I hope that answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I used Botanicare as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the brand that I use in my small
batch personal grows for my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: For myself, if I'm going to smoke it,
it's probably grown with Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do plan on doing a side by side between
Botanicare and VegBloom in the near
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be completely honest about what
I see and I will share my experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: my results here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys make sure you support Botanicare
and VegBloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used them both in different
environments and different scenarios and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're both wonderful products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to run a side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a five by five hut and another
five by five hydro hut in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: With very similar light, with the same
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on a flip box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every 12 hours, one comes on, one shuts
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a flowering chamber that's
always being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do VegBloom on one side and I
want to do Botanicare on the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will completely post a ton of
pictures to my Instagram and I'll let you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I want to thank our friend
Mazar420 for sending me a great email that
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me a lot of information to ramble off
at you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pulling up the next email here on my
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next email comes from, he signed it
with his real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he says, hi, my name is Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, let's read this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have spoken before, but I have another
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live in Oklahoma city where the heat
gets pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get into a hundred or above in my
garden room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if a bigger carbon filter
would help me out any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm running a 400 watt high
pressure sodium and a metal halide Apollo
[SPEAKER_01]: light with a four inch carbon filter and
inline fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking about getting an air
conditioner, but I don't want to if I can
[SPEAKER_01]: lower temps with the carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the day, the temps get from 110 to
110.
[SPEAKER_01]: 115, thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, 110 and 115 in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is tremendously warm for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Development stops, growth and development
stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Production stops inside your plant around
85, 90 degrees, unless you're introducing
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're inducing CO2, if you've got very
high levels of CO2, your plants can
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerate in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: 110 to 115, you're stressing the shit out
of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds are starting to spread out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting airy buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be small.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are going to be stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidity is probably getting fucking
ridiculous in that room with that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing about this is you're not
going to have any bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: No damn bug in the world is going to want
to hang out in 115 degree grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your main question, let's get to the
point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your question is, will a carbon filter
help cool that room?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: A carbon filter does not provide any
cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to introduce cooler air into that
room and you need to remove the hot air
[SPEAKER_01]: from the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fan won't help you because it's just
going to blow hot air around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to exchange the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get that heat out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bigger ducting and a bigger blower
to blow the heat out, but a bigger carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: filter won't help you cool the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a large room, get yourself a
window model like the window kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a smaller room and you don't have
a window for it, get yourself one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: portable rolling air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the Solius 14,000 BTU
portable air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not sponsor me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I need an air conditioner, a rolling
air conditioner for a home grow or a small
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, that's what I go get is one of those
Solius 14,000 BTU.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an air conditioner and it's a
dehumidifier all in one unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about waist high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only about three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a little R2D2, you guys,
and it's got a duct that runs out and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's got a duct that can come in
also if you choose to duct in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't duct in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just let the air conditioner recycle the
air in the room is where that air comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that air is already cool kind of that's
going into the compressor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it blows the heat through a duct,
a four inch duct, and you can mount that
[SPEAKER_01]: duct wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually board up a window, cut a four
inch hole through the window, put a duct
[SPEAKER_01]: mount onto that window and run that four
inch air conditioning duct right out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That 14,000 BTU unit would be overkill for
your 400 watt HPS and your metal Howlite
[SPEAKER_01]: Apollo light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming that your small grow room is
inside of another room since it's so small
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not worried that you have a small
grow room and I'm making fun of you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm just wondering is this grow room
inside of another room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have this, like did you construct a
small room inside of a bedroom or this may
[SPEAKER_01]: be a closet also?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's a small room, maybe you can
air condition that room a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: better and then duct the heat out of your
grow and just air condition the outside
[SPEAKER_01]: environment so that you're bringing in
cooler air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need cooler air in that room
carbon filters not going to cool off the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fan is not going to cool off the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually need some free on in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need an air conditioner, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friend, Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says we've spoken before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you're reading your email
address, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to send me more emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will read your questions and answer your
questions on the podcast all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to send me an email,
I would love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to follow me on Twitter it's
at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check me out on Instagram, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I post a whole bunch of quality cannabis
photography on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iri, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have to press pause for one quick
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab and a drink and I
will be right back with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just took a big old fat dab of
pineapple Jack shatter from Turpex and I
[SPEAKER_01]: dunked it in OG ghost train haze fresh
turps from our friends at Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like my brain was put on a rocket
and launched into outer space and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: blew up like one of those beautiful
fireworks and then it all just came back
[SPEAKER_01]: together and floated down into my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens when you dunk your
dabs in turps and you take big old fat
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody involved in making
these turps happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the lab manager from Evo Labs on the
last podcast and that's the one that the
[SPEAKER_01]: memory card ate and we cannot listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Brett.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we could have done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Brett, that means you got to come back
on the show and smoke some turps with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe a huge thank you to Dab and Granny
and I owe a huge thank you to Brett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab and Granny showed up with enough turps
to dab out an army and Brett tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big thanks to you guys for showing up
to the podcast while prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also thanks to the Canna Canyon for
letting me invade the small corner of
[SPEAKER_01]: their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had four couches and a table occupied
and nobody could hang out in that region
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were doing the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mind if people hung out,
but when they saw the microphones come
[SPEAKER_01]: out, they heard me talking, they all just
took off to be polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind if they hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the ambience and the vibe in the
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambling like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag, they like it when I ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to share with you guys a little
progress on my most current breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow me, you know that I am a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the head breeder for iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am currently working with a male plant
that I call Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strain is known as Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male plant himself has been named
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is going to father many children.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will be the grandfather to many
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Solomon is my male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an Arise plant, which is a cross of
a Golden Goat female that was pollinated
[SPEAKER_01]: by a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daybreaker came from Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much love and respect to Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Daybreaker is Joseph OG and Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be a little bit of OG
Kush and Kim Dog lineage in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I crossed that to, I put the
pollen from that male onto the Golden
[SPEAKER_01]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Golden Goat is Island Sweet Skunk and
Romulan and a Hawaiian Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got that tropical tasty flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pollinated it with that cushy,
skunky funk flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of everything in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixed it all together and it made a strain
called Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found three or four really great
phenotypes of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very Golden Goat reminiscent
phenotype of Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not keep that one because I've got
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one that's got this sweet,
skunky, funky, you can't keep it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: baggie without all your friends saying,
smoke some of that weed with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite female of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's one that makes really long,
skinny buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know where it came from,
but it gives you this hazy eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where the haze came from in
the genetics, but it just makes your head
[SPEAKER_01]: melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your eyes just get retarded, squinty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just start stuttering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That phenotype is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, there are three or four key
phenotypes that I've found.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put all three of those phenotypes,
not the Golden Goat dominant phenotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I put my three favorite phenotypes in
a room with a male of this same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the male of the same strain from the
same seed pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the F1s, the male and the female
in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This male, I posted pictures of him to my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes male flower clusters as long as
my arm, which is very amazing for a male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to make buds like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little bit of resin on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells very pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a hint of vomit to the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, vomit is a good trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a male plant that smells
like vomit or feet or a bar trash can,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a good breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to pass on good, good
aromatic traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got that male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got, let's see, what else is
in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a Golden Goat female because I'm
going to do a little bit of a Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_01]: bat cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Lemon Skunk female in there
because I want to see what this Arise does
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a Grateful Dog female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are multiple phenotypes of the
Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be Arise F2s coming out very
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be tested by a bunch of my people
before they're available to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people get to test them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there will be Grateful Dog to Arise,
which doesn't even have a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be Golden Goat to Arise,
which would be like a Golden Goat bat
[SPEAKER_01]: cross, kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there'll be Lemon Skunk cross to
Arise, which who knows what that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those plants make a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those plants have a really nice
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really see a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are currently, the date today is,
I'm pressing my button.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my phone, it's the 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went into flower on the 3rd,
so they're 11 days in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male plant is getting big old balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: His balls are starting, you know when the
male plant starts to flower out,
[SPEAKER_01]: the balls point up, but now they're
starting to hang.
[SPEAKER_01]: His nuts are starting to hang,
which means within the next four to six
[SPEAKER_01]: days, I'm going to have pollen coming out
of there, which may be a little earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: than I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to move him over to another
room to keep him away from the girls
[SPEAKER_01]: because the girls, their pistols,
the little, you guys call them hairs
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, the little white pistols,
the hairs on the plant that looks like a
[SPEAKER_01]: dandelion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want those nice and thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them thick and stout before I put
that pollen on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to move this boy to another
area just to keep him from dusting his
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen on these girls too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I see all the girls have
their pistols nice and hairy, nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: furry, almost that tarantula look,
then I'm going to bring the boy over there
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm going to just leave him in the
room with them overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the morning, as soon as the
lights come on, I'm going to give him a
[SPEAKER_01]: little shake and that pollen is just going
to dust all those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to do that probably
four or five days again, or four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: days later, I'm going to do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let the lights come on and walk in
there and give them a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: shake and just get that pollen all over
all those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say a little bit of a shake,
guys, if you grab a male cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that is in full flower, that's got pollen
sacks hanging off of it, you could flick
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, listen, I'm going to flick the
microphone stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You flick it that hard, pollen goes
everywhere, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after that, I'll have to take a shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to change clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to go spray down any female
plants that I do not want receiving
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be some work, but it'll be
definitely, definitely worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to change clothes, wash my
dreadlocks before I go to anybody else's
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't disrespect anyone else's garden
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put on specific clothes that cover me
up most of the way so that I can just drop
[SPEAKER_01]: them right in the washer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a chore, but that's where my breeding
project is, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male is just getting ready to drop
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, I just kicked the dog again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to kick you.
[SPEAKER_01]: His head's right here on my foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time I get excited, I move my
foot and give him a good head kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: This ain't no UFC over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my plants are, the breeding project is
11 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males are just dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male is just starting to drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The females are almost ready to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to separate them for a little
bit just to put some tension in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to reintroduce them
together in a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they pollinate, it's
probably going to be about six weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: before those seeds are ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let them go about seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to let them go too long,
but I want them nice and done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will set them all in individual areas
over individual containers and just let
[SPEAKER_01]: them dry for a couple of few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pre-trim them at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just take off all the big leaves
when we cut them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the fan leaves will be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll hang them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll let them dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just take the plants and you
basically cut one stick off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put on rubber gloves and hold it
over like a pie plate and just start
[SPEAKER_01]: crushing up the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just hear the seeds fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're smoking old school
Mexican brickweed and all those seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: just going tink, tink, tink, tink,
tink, tink, tink, tink, tink into the pie
[SPEAKER_01]: plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just crumble them up with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I push all the weed up to one
side and I tip the pan and all the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: roll down to the other side and I take
those out and put them in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets carefully labeled of what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave the lid open for a couple of few
days just so that if there's any moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: in there that those seeds will dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've got a Mason jar full of
well-labeled seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I've got all of them,
I'll weigh the seeds, get a good estimate
[SPEAKER_01]: of how many seeds I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll send a lot of those seeds
out to friends of mine with a note that
[SPEAKER_01]: says, these are testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please test these, take a lot of pictures,
make a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give some to local people and the
requirement is if you find a champion,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a clone of that sucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got something good, I get a
clone of the best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you some tester packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be probably looking at 12 weeks
before anything will even be done from
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there will be seeds in 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: People check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post pictures of what comes of it
because I'll grow a bunch of them by
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog just got up and left because I
kicked him in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I didn't mean to kick you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't ever kick your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love your dog, scratch your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breed good cannabis.
