[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far let me remind you
that we are approaching the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in my neighborhood we play a game
which I like to call gunshots or
[SPEAKER_00]: fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often we hear some bangs some booms
some pops and at this time of year you
[SPEAKER_00]: just wonder was that gunshots or fireworks
and you place your bets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes you never find out who's the
winner or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is if you hear some bangs some
pops and booms play along try to decide
[SPEAKER_00]: with me where those gunshots or fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time when I do want to invite
you to the Dude Grow Growers Cup.

[SPEAKER_00]: love to see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's move on I do have a lot to
talk about in this podcast I've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: email here in front of me which I get very
often I don't answer this question enough
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is a big podcast so I did put
this one together for you the question is
[SPEAKER_00]: very simple it says I have a spider mite
problem I could read you a lot more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: email but I think that gets us right to
the point let's jump into something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is very important for any cannabis grower
of any level if you're brand new at
[SPEAKER_00]: growing if you're experienced at growing
if you're somewhere in between there
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated pest management is something
that should be on your radar on your mind
[SPEAKER_00]: in your standard operating procedures that
should be part of your method part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: method to your madness we are going to get
invaded by bugs at some point you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: not gotten bugs at this point I'm gonna
knock on wood for you and hope that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get them but the chances are someday
you're going to get bugs and I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: you to be prepared understand how to
eradicate them also understand how to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent them so let's get into an
integrated pest management podcast the
[SPEAKER_00]: main question is about spiders mites but
with any pest any bug almost most problems
[SPEAKER_00]: in life I like to say set yourself up for
success when it comes to bugs spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips fungus gnats almost any pest we can
think of prevention is key if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent them from getting in there have
some sort of security system in place a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedure that will
make things a lot easier so if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: already doing some sort of preventative
program to make sure the bugs don't come
[SPEAKER_00]: now may be a good time to start thinking
about it think about it this way when shit
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down would you rather have security
guards that are waiting to break up the
[SPEAKER_00]: rumble the might battle the might orgy
because that's what's gonna happen it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a might picnic and then a might
orgy do you want security guards there
[SPEAKER_00]: already those security guards could be
either a spray application or those
[SPEAKER_00]: security guards could be other beneficial
insects but would you rather have security
[SPEAKER_00]: on standby or would you have to rather
have to call the cops and wait for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: show up which could be for you to spot the
problem and then start applying a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide or maybe even to have to order
the predator bugs from an insectiary wait
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to come distribute them wait for
them to develop population and start
[SPEAKER_00]: eradicating your bugs prevention is key I
would rather have security on hand I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have to wait for those bugs or
sprays to arrive so prevention is key what
[SPEAKER_00]: are you doing in your room to make sure
that no bugs get into your room there are
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of things you can do if you've got
cracks in the walls seal those cracks up
[SPEAKER_00]: with some caulk if you've got a window or
something where things can get in get some
[SPEAKER_00]: tape over that get some sort of sealer
think of all the ins and outs in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space and seal all of that stuff up keep
in mind it gets cold outside it gets hot
[SPEAKER_00]: outside in your grow room that's the most
perfect environment for most of the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're gonna face that's why they
thrive so well in our grow room we're
[SPEAKER_00]: providing the perfect temperature the
perfect vpd we give water at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific interval and the bugs love that
rhythm if the plants are happy the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably happy as well so it's outside
the bugs can feel and sense that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: warmth in that other room they can smell
those great terps in that other room and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like hey guys it's cold and shitty
we're out here living in a fucking rose
[SPEAKER_00]: bush let's go party in there where the
weed plants are and all the spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: just find one little crack in the wall one
little gap in the window they congregate
[SPEAKER_00]: into your weed plants where it's fucking
beautiful it's jamaica and they're all day
[SPEAKER_00]: long you got it at just the right temp
just the right vpd they go make a little
[SPEAKER_00]: hammock up on one of your plants they
start eating then they start breeding then
[SPEAKER_00]: they take over so they know that it's
there let's prevent them from coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: let's think about ways that these bugs get
into our grows a lot of times like i just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned they come in through the cracks
in the wall sometimes they're already
[SPEAKER_00]: there many of these bugs are very common
if there are plants around they're already
[SPEAKER_00]: there but how do they get into the grow if
they're not already in the space a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times they will come in your soil many
people blame a specific brand of soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix for having bugs in it every
brand can have bugs in it i don't care if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ocean forest i don't care if it's
pearl mix i don't care if it's roots
[SPEAKER_00]: organics all of those bags of dirt have
the potential to have bugs in them i've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten bugs in every bag of dirt every
brand there's been no brand that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: bug free let's talk about this people
claim i bought ocean forest and got bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: in it i bought roots 707 and got bugs in
it i bought the other brand whatever it is
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter yes of course there's
bugs in there it's fucking soil it's
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix it's dirt it's very desirable
for bugs also it is made stored and kept
[SPEAKER_00]: in a place where those bugs are very
readily available you can't blame any
[SPEAKER_00]: specific brand for giving you bugs all of
the bags of soil are kept and most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are made very near each other then they're
sent to a warehouse they're all kept in a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse together do you think the bugs
go hey let's just go into this one bag
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just the bugs are not brand loyal is
what i'm trying to say they don't care
[SPEAKER_00]: about they can't see the cool coloring on
the roots or on the fox farms bag they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know those fish are even printed
there those bugs go wherever they can go
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a party to get some warmth to get
some food they want to eat and they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed just like you they're going to go
into every bag that's available you just
[SPEAKER_00]: bought a bag that had bugs in it and it
happened to be whichever brand you chose
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you've gotten a bag of soil that had
bugs in it it wasn't the maker of that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil's fault that soil went to a warehouse
it stayed in a warehouse possibly outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a very popular grow supply center
in Colorado Springs they keep all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil outdoors if there's there are bugs in
one bag they're going in every bag they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna overload that one bag all the food
all the hiding places the hotel will be
[SPEAKER_00]: booked they're gonna go somewhere else
which is the next bag over it may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: different brand it may be the same brand
all the brands are gonna get bugs they get
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred in the same trucks the roots
organics the fox farms the tupper the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking everything it came on the same
truck why wouldn't the bugs travel from
[SPEAKER_00]: bag to bag so don't blame any specific
brand for getting bugs into your grow that
[SPEAKER_00]: is your responsibility as the farmer as
the lead grower as the head cultivator as
[SPEAKER_00]: the head motherfucker in charge it is your
responsibility to make sure that bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: don't make it into your grow inspect the
soil treat it with the pest aside treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: with the treat it with the predator bug if
that's what you've got to do but be
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative inspect your soil it is your
job to make sure that doesn't get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: treat everything like there is bugs there
are bugs on everything that comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: there's bugs in the soil let's talk about
the next way they come in they come in on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are you bringing in clones are you
getting cuttings from a friend that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great way to bring in bugs all of your
friends are gonna say dude my grow is
[SPEAKER_00]: clean I don't have anything the person
that claims to have the cleanest grow is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually the person with the worst bugs
they just haven't found them yet so when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a clone or a plant or a cutting
from a friend to make sure it is treated
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the best way to bring unwanted bugs
into your grow room all right here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: side note that I'm going to totally derail
my train of thought and try to throw this
[SPEAKER_00]: in it's not on my notes but I just thought
about this we build very nice grow rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors we put really good lights in there
we put ducting in there we clean
[SPEAKER_00]: everything up hopefully hopefully you're
cleaning your grow space clean that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: up dude I'm talking to myself too we build
these really nice controlled environments
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not find it wise I would not
recommend to move our ganja plants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have in our indoor area outdoors for
sunshine during the day and then back
[SPEAKER_00]: inside I would not recommend that if that
is something you choose to do if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: your main strategy that's cool but if that
is your main grow space where you mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: intend to have the plants indoors I
wouldn't contaminate it with the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants the minute you put those plants
outdoors they're gonna get trespassers
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna get stowaways you're gonna
bring them into your grow space they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna find places to hide in there it's
Jamaica like we talked about earlier it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a perfect environment in there some of the
bugs might hop off that plant and stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room the next time you carry that
plant outside so now you've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated that indoor grow with outdoor
bugs you just brought the bugs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason we really built that room was to
isolate everything and keep that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: safe from all of those outdoor bugs we've
got a perfect room in there so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend moving your plants from indoors
to outdoors that is not and then back in
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not something I would recommend
have indoor plants or have outdoor plants
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you're gonna do light depth
and some shit like that is gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: but my general recommendation is if you've
built a nice indoor grow room have a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow room that you've never
contaminated with those outdoor plants
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was getting to before that I want
to get back on track is when you get new
[SPEAKER_00]: plants new clones from a friend make sure
you isolate those plants don't take those
[SPEAKER_00]: right into general population you can put
if you get a clone a small plant you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in the window sill for a couple of
days take it out of the window treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: with whatever pesticide you choose to use
something I use something strong when shit
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in if I get a cut from anybody if it
was from one of my best friends if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: from my mama if it was from my girlfriend
or a complete stranger I'm going to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone the same it's contaminated in
my mind it is contaminated it's got mites
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips spider fungus gnats powdery mildew
it's got herpes it's got all these shit
[SPEAKER_00]: you could imagine I'm gonna treat it and
keep it away from my plants for seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: ten days until I'm sure that that plant is
clear then it gets to go into general
[SPEAKER_00]: population I cannot risk bringing shit in
and destroying a grow I got spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: from a very reputable grower and they were
the most ferocious fucking spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever seen they did some damage slowed
me down we recovered however they did fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: me up I learned my lesson there I talked
about mistakes I've made trusting a very
[SPEAKER_00]: reputable popular grower fucked me over I
got a clone that was riddled with mites I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it right in and before I noticed
we're fucked all right we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how bugs come in bugs come in on you have
the soil they make it in in the soil bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: come in in other plants bugs also come in
on you your clothing your shoes your
[SPEAKER_00]: dreadlocks yes I'm holding up my own
dreadlocks I'm guilty I'm talking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: myself I have my dreads go to my calves
you guys I don't know if you've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: recent pictures I posted on the gram my
dreadlocks I'm six foot five I'm six foot
[SPEAKER_00]: five tall and my dreadlocks touch my
calves I got quite a bit of hair I do have
[SPEAKER_00]: a dedicated grow area hat I keep the
dreads tied up I try to keep the just try
[SPEAKER_00]: to mitigate problems there but you do
bring you travel the bugs around through
[SPEAKER_00]: your shoes your pants your shirt your
dreadlocks your long hair whatever you may
[SPEAKER_00]: be wearing that's a great way to move bugs
around also we've talked about it before
[SPEAKER_00]: the dog will bring bugs into your grow
room I don't prefer to have the dog in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that's man's best friend but be my
best friend upstairs we'll hang out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard stay out of my way in my grow
space so the bugs make it in in a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of ways it is our responsibility to
minimize those ways for those bugs to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in it's your responsibility like I said is
we're farmers we are growing an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural product we've got to keep a
farmers mindset in mind and that means
[SPEAKER_00]: we're battling pests and insects at all
times unfortunately some of the pests that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are battling are nearly or are actually
microscopic so we can't even see them so
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to pay attention to the plants
we've got to keep a good eye on the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what that garden is telling us and
be ready to react as soon as we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem based on an insect now the
reaction part is where people really mess
[SPEAKER_00]: up they see a small problem and they want
to do something freaking crazy to solve
[SPEAKER_00]: that problem and they overkill the small
problem and cause a bigger bigger problem
[SPEAKER_00]: by panic mode I talk about panic mode
grower panic mode you see that little
[SPEAKER_00]: issue and you've got your plants are at
risk and now you just fuck everything up
[SPEAKER_00]: because you went into panic mode and
didn't think things through think about
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're gonna do when you get those
pests start thinking now how nuclear do I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go how gentle do I want to go how
abrasive or toxic do I want to be with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides which I choose to use that is
up to you I will make recommendations I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: give you product names but I do not judge
you based on the pesticides you choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: use in your garden I do judge you if you
use a product too late in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage or in flowering stage and there are
residual chemicals left behind that can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause harm to a consumer I will judge you
for that if you use a pesticide correctly
[SPEAKER_00]: and properly at the right interval
duration dilution application rate you're
[SPEAKER_00]: safe about it I will not judge you for any
product you choose to use if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it safely and correctly that's what the
products are for that's what we're we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a goal we've got a product to protect
I understand but it is your your
[SPEAKER_00]: prerogative how toxic how gentle how what
what products you want to use some things
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty fucking rough some things are
really fluffy and gentle people want to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to the word organic I always say
remember that cyanide is organic and just
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of drops of that will kill you so
don't let the word organic be too much of
[SPEAKER_00]: a buzzword when it comes to pest
eradication just because a product is
[SPEAKER_00]: organic doesn't mean that it is safer less
harmful to a human body less harmful to
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment than a product that
doesn't have an organic stamp on it also
[SPEAKER_00]: with that same thing being said an organic
product does not have to be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: less effective than a non-organic product
for the right situation that organic
[SPEAKER_00]: product may wipe out your fucking problem
on the same in the same battlefield in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different situation that non-organic
product may be exactly what you need it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all about situation it's all about
understanding it's all about the pest
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to attack a lot of it is
based on the phase of growth which these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are in I want to get back to where
I was it is up to you to decide the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of abrasiveness toxicity how powerful how
potent you want to go with your pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: do your research on the products you are
thinking about using read the MSDS sheet
[SPEAKER_00]: see what's in there read the active
ingredient read is it toxic is it
[SPEAKER_00]: poisonous what does it do to the
environment read about that product do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to spray that on flowers that you're
going to consume if you're the only one
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming it spray whatever the fuck you
feel you're safe with doing if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give it to other people keep them
in mind spray something that is safer
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe stick with something with a shorter
half-life something let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: half-life somebody asked me about this in
an Instagram live feed lately recently
[SPEAKER_00]: half-life when I spray a product over a
certain duration it is going to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% and that product will not be available
on the plants anymore it I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact science it biodegrades it breaks
down it disappears the Sun breaks it down
[SPEAKER_00]: the wind breaks it down the rain breaks it
down the the availability of that product
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plants dilutes dissipates again I'm
not completely qualified to teach this but
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll teach you the way that I know it when
you spray that product on there it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent over a certain amount of
time it breaks down to 50% then over at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time again it breaks down to 25% then
over time you get twelve and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: percent then over time again you get six
point two five percent then eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: you're down to three point twelve percent
keeps breaking half-life understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: half-life of the product you are using
also understand the re-entry interval of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product you are using that is when you
apply a product in a grow space how long
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have to wait to safely enter that
grow space again now I want to group these
[SPEAKER_00]: two things together take your half-life
and your re-entry interval and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing indoors increase those drastically
because in an outdoor environment we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the Sun the Sun will break down those
chemicals those products those agents the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients in the pesticide spray and
they won't last as long on the plant they
[SPEAKER_00]: will disappear they'll be gone basically
in a shorter amount of time because like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said earlier the wind the Sun the rain
those things get rid of those products
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors we've got caustic grow lights that
are nowhere near as powerful as the Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not breaking the chemicals down as
quickly so they will be there longer we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the same ventilation indoors so
your half-life and your re-entry interval
[SPEAKER_00]: basically need to be doubled indoors some
people aren't gonna follow that some
[SPEAKER_00]: people think I'm crazy as somebody who is
trained by the Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture it's my responsibility to make
sure I say it what you do with that info
[SPEAKER_00]: is up to you you're a grown-ass fucking
adult have fun do your thing pimping all
[SPEAKER_00]: right the next thing I want to talk about
I'm going out of order on my notes here
[SPEAKER_00]: but I feel like this is very important
protective personal equipment PPE personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment I don't know what
order I said it in the first time but
[SPEAKER_00]: protect your protect yourself with the
proper personal protective equipment you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys when you buy a pesticide there's a
little booklet on the side of the bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not a story about the guy that made
the pesticide that's not a comic book that
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually the instructions and a bunch
of tips about that product it will tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you if that product is if you can drink it
it'll tell you if it's dangerous it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you if it's toxic it'll tell you if
it'll fucking kill you it will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the personal protective equipment that is
recommended for that product most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time they're going to want you to wear six
millimeter or thick is it millimeter or
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter millimeters these are solids
milliliters or liquids you want six
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter or thicker nitrile gloves most
pesticides are going to ask you to wear
[SPEAKER_00]: long sleeves we don't want you to get any
pesticide on your skin most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: pants cover your feet with shoes a lot of
the time they're going to want to mask
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of a respirator every time we
want some sort of eye protection what you
[SPEAKER_00]: do from there will be probably pesticide
specific but I recommend putting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment before you
get the pesticides what if and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know where you work I don't know where you
grow but what if the person that managed
[SPEAKER_00]: that pesticide before you didn't put the
lid on it all the way and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally grab it and the next move to do
with the pesticide is to give it a shake
[SPEAKER_00]: then measure some out what if you're just
moving doing your thing you got Joe Rogan
[SPEAKER_00]: in your ear maybe I'm in your ear jamming
the podcast you grab that bottle you give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a shake if you or the person before you
didn't put that lid on all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide is now flying out of that bottle
if that pesticide gets in your eye you
[SPEAKER_00]: could be fucked you could be really fucked
you could have some big problems it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna burn it's gonna suck but you could
have long-term damage let's have our
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment on before we
even touch the pesticides it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: overkill which is what I want I want
overkill I want you to be safe I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to get sick I don't need you
contaminated I want you to live through
[SPEAKER_00]: this we're growing cannabis let's not get
fucking hurt growing cannabis we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke some urban chill out not end up in
the fucking hospital so personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment is very important let
me get back on track here and keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: notes here the products you decide are up
to you the applications you decide to use
[SPEAKER_00]: are up to you many people will choose to
use predator insects if that's what you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to do that is up to you it's all up
to what you want to do in your grow that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the best parts about growing weed
you get to decide to decide what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do one important thing though is
monitoring that grow and keeping an eye
[SPEAKER_00]: out for bugs how are you gonna know if
bugs there are there are you scouting
[SPEAKER_00]: personally do you have a crew scouting
occasionally do you walk in and just
[SPEAKER_00]: blindly grab it a leaf occasionally I
don't even know what plant I just touched
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just go right there and I took a
leaf and I'm going to inspect this leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: very carefully I'm gonna look at the top
of it I can tell a lot by the top no
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew it doesn't look like any
chew marks no trip shit looks good flip it
[SPEAKER_00]: over do I see any spider mites do I see
any fungus gnats do we see any white flies
[SPEAKER_00]: if that leaf is cool probably pretty good
I won't pull another one I don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen all the info I need but I will
go in there sometimes twice a day in my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grow and just give it a good
scouting how does shit look are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs one thing I want to talk about is
yellow sticky traps and the blue sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: traps those little cards you guys like to
use I love them I highly recommend them
[SPEAKER_00]: those are great products however those are
not any way to eradicate or remove a bug
[SPEAKER_00]: what those are there for is to show you
that there is a presence of a pest they do
[SPEAKER_00]: not do anything to get rid of a bug a bug
has to land on that fucking yellow card
[SPEAKER_00]: for it to do anything how many of the bugs
do you think oh look a yellow card let's
[SPEAKER_00]: jump right on to it most of them don't do
that those are there to show you some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bugs that are in here were stupid
enough to fly onto the yellow card there
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably a lot more and you should
think about it a lot of them come with
[SPEAKER_00]: like a grid they've got squares printed on
there that's so that during the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: you can count basically get a good visual
count how many bugs per square there are
[SPEAKER_00]: two bugs per square there are five bugs
per square there are 20 per square we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really stepping our shit up check again at
lunch see how many there are see over the
[SPEAKER_00]: day how many bugs progress do you need to
do something about it or is it an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable amount of bugs what's cool with
you a few fungus gnats in a big grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fine a bunch of fungus gnats in a
small grow fuck that we got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something it's up to you but those yellow
sticky traps are not any source of
[SPEAKER_00]: eradication they are alerting their
notification it's not doing anything but
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you there are bugs here now let's
talk a little bit about things we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of and prevent pests in our
grow of course the first some of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: things we can do come with standard
standard operating procedures i guess the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing is building a proper room seal
that room up or all the gaps from outside
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed or all the gaps from the other room
sealed are you clean when you're going in
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a standard operating procedure
do you have grow room clothes do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room shoes do you have grow room a
grow room hat for your dreadlocks are you
[SPEAKER_00]: stepping on one of those mats that's got
the cleaner in it to clean up your shoes
[SPEAKER_00]: do you put on booties do you wear a scrub
jacket to go in there or a lab coat or
[SPEAKER_00]: scrubs to go in there what are you doing
to prevent the bugs the next thing we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do is i think defoliation is a great way
to minimize all of the problems in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow if we defoliate i basically describe
the leaves as like hotels and hammocks for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants it's where the plants are
chilling that's houses and hotels they're
[SPEAKER_00]: on the leaves they're not chilling out on
the stocks mostly maybe if you got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're on the leaves if there aren't
too many leaves there aren't too many
[SPEAKER_00]: places for bugs also that's a less
opportunity for powdery mildew get that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of there you don't need all those
leaves that's going to lead to problems
[SPEAKER_00]: people say that the leaves are the source
of food and the solar panels for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants dude there are so many leaves in
there you could take some out don't worry
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have to worry about the food
we're feeding the fucking plants through
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots we're giving them very expensive
nutrients they're eating and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the best light that they can take
off some of those leaves so that the light
[SPEAKER_00]: can get to the buds that you want to get
big and fat defoliate that will help you
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent bug problems also turn up the fan
i think if you turn up some fans and have
[SPEAKER_00]: some airflow in there the bugs don't want
to be around as much also one thing i will
[SPEAKER_00]: notice though if the bugs do if the spider
mites start getting out of control they
[SPEAKER_00]: use those fans as like um it's kind of
like a hang light or they climb up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant and they catch the wind
off the fan and they drop a web and they
[SPEAKER_00]: blow from this plant right over to the
next one they use the fan to do it so have
[SPEAKER_00]: the fan in there so that they can't
colonize they can't establish a presence
[SPEAKER_00]: but once they do get present you might
want to slow down that fan to keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: from traveling around so much now another
thing we can do to prevent some bugs is to
[SPEAKER_00]: just make an undesirable environment for
any bug that may show up any pests that
[SPEAKER_00]: may come around let me give a quick
disclaimer 99% of what i'm going to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you is going to be for an indoor grow
outdoor growing is a whole new beast we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on that not very much now i said
create an undesirable environment for the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs i've said before that we're creating
jamaica in our grow space we've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect vpd the temp is great the humidity
is great just enough wind to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable we don't disrupt it there's no
predators in there unless you've
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced some so let's make an
environment that is undesirable for these
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs maybe occasionally you can just mist
the plants with water they don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: water a lot of the bugs don't want to hang
out if it's too humid 90% of our bugs are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be on the underside of the leaf
the top of the leaf you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it they're going to be on the bottom
so come from the underside of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with your little mister with your spray
bottle and just start at the bottom and
[SPEAKER_00]: work your way up under the plant lift up
the leaves as you go and spray the
[SPEAKER_00]: underside make it undesirable if you want
to add a product you can put in some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of insecticidal soap or you can step up
your game and start actually using a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide as a preventative there is no
problem and i highly recommend using a
[SPEAKER_00]: spray application of pesticides on a
weekly basis to keep bugs at bay so some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first steps are to prep the room
the next step is to have a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedure so that you don't
bring bugs in through the soil through
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants or through your clothes then
we start creating an undesirable
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for the bugs a little bit of
defoliation a little bit of wind maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: some moisture on the leaves maybe i
recommend start applying a foliar fed pest
[SPEAKER_00]: application some sort of pesticide
targeted for the bugs you know you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get in your area i would
recommend doing preventative sprays on a
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly basis rotate your products then if
you do see a pest problem start to arise
[SPEAKER_00]: then increase the interval the amount of
sprays increase the amount of spray that
[SPEAKER_00]: you put in the mix then maybe start doing
rotations of a stronger pesticide more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently now i do recommend a rotation
of pesticides because these bugs will
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a resistance to pesticides think
about if i walked in your grow space every
[SPEAKER_00]: day and tapped you on the shoulder and
threw just a shitty left jab at you by day
[SPEAKER_00]: three you're gonna block that left jab
you're gonna here comes the jab tap you on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shoulder you're gonna turn on your
block will already be up you'll be ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to block my left jab no problem if i came
in there on day four tapped you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder threw a vicious right cross
you're not going to be ready for that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna get you we've got to do that to
the spider mites also they do learn they
[SPEAKER_00]: do start to build up resistance they are
evolutionary creatures they will say oh
[SPEAKER_00]: you sprayed evergreen on me three days in
a row watch this day four the bugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: live from the first three days of
evergreen they're gonna lick their arm and
[SPEAKER_00]: they go ah evergreen and they're just
gonna look at you like they're fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy they're gonna eat up the evergreen
and get stronger from it so i recommend a
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation of products i will go through a
list of products that i do recommend once
[SPEAKER_00]: again nobody pays me they're just shit
that's shit that i know that works let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about some of the pests that you will
encounter in your indoor grow let me do
[SPEAKER_00]: that disclaimer once again this is going
to be mostly indoors i'm an indoor grower
[SPEAKER_00]: i do have a greenhouse a couple of
greenhouses what did i say that got some
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses going but most of this is
indoor stuff what bugs are we going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors in our garden most commonly we are
going to see spider mites the dreaded
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites spider mites are scary a lot
of people think they're a huge deal uh
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a fucked up situation depending on
the stage of growth which you are in but
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites are very easy to get rid of
if you are patient have a strategy and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what you are doing and you're
not lazy about it you cannot be lazy in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow the bugs will take over if you
get lazy they'll start fucking challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: you um basically you're going to see the
two spotted mite um the real problem is
[SPEAKER_00]: the russet mite if you've got russet mites
that changes everything i do uh consulting
[SPEAKER_00]: my consultation includes pest eradication
in your grow if you've got russet mites i
[SPEAKER_00]: do charge you another level to get rid of
those in a commercial grow it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive it takes a lot more work it's a
lot more strategy a lot more cooperation
[SPEAKER_00]: from the team so we've got spider mites
another thing you may see are thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: people get scared of thrips people have a
long it takes them a long time to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's actually a thrip issue thrips
are easy we can definitely get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips aphids you may see aphids in your
grow aphids of all colors aphids have
[SPEAKER_00]: become like fucking skittles they're every
color now through evolution and through uh
[SPEAKER_00]: regional evolution i guess it is there are
aphids of every fucking color you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: them they're not a big deal we can get rid
of those as well uh fungi gnats are very
[SPEAKER_00]: common in a grow environment those are
very very easy to get rid of not very
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic but they can lead to other
problems they can be uh they if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a small problem plus fungus gnats those
two together compound a problem very well
[SPEAKER_00]: another common issue is white flies a lot
of people will get white flies indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors uh those are very easy to
eradicate another big issue that's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: bug per se but does happen quite often is
powdery mildew especially here in colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: we get huge temperature swings temperature
spikes uh last year in the winter we had
[SPEAKER_00]: negative 17 degree temperatures try
keeping your grow room warm inside with
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall right here and then on the other
side of that wall it's fucking negative 17
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees there's snow packed up against the
walls and you're just trying to balance
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit out in the rooms there's
condensation raining from the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling it's very interesting at that time
of year we do get powdery mildew from that
[SPEAKER_00]: show so be prepared um let's talk about
outdoor outdoors is totally different you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys i am not super experienced with the
outdoor but outdoor uh you may experience
[SPEAKER_00]: birds birds could be problematic i've seen
birds steal buds just fly down and pinch
[SPEAKER_00]: little pieces of the weed off the weed
plant all season long and just destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants uh deer deer will come and eat your
whole fucking plant i've seen bears come i
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't seen them personally i've seen
instances where bears have come and stolen
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from the grow bunnies are notorious
if you got too many rabbits they'll eat
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit out of your plants um in colorado
we get these caterpillars we get moths
[SPEAKER_00]: that land in the plants they lay eggs and
those turn into these orange caterpillars
[SPEAKER_00]: those things have fucking ruined so many
crops of people that i know so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a lot of outdoor bugs one oh
another thing we should think about
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors is thieves we get a lot of
thieves especially here in colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: especially here in pueblo people love to
steal your outdoor weeds so if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to plant outdoor weed plant one for
the crook one for the bugs one for the
[SPEAKER_00]: bunnies and then maybe you'll get one for
yourself also i'm hoping you get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm being optimistic uh i've done a full
episode on bud washing if you do go
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors your outdoor weed may be very
dirty there may be some bugs in there i've
[SPEAKER_00]: done an episode on bud washing maybe check
out the bud washing episode that may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good episode for rinsing off your outdoor
weed a lot of people are that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial i think it's a good show
check that out i digress let's get more
[SPEAKER_00]: into integrated pest management we've
talked about the bugs that we were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to face we're going to face spider mites
thrips aphids fungus gnats white flies
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly powdery mildew um there are other
things that a lot of the grow books talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that do pop up honestly mealy bugs
and scales and shit like that is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: very uncommon i've been growing for a
thousand years it feels like i've never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a mealy bug or a scale so we're not
going to worry too much about that let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about now about options on how to get
rid of these bugs we've talked about ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of prevent them let's talk about
ways to get rid of them i am a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja grower i like to grow in large
warehouses with large plants with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: toys the way that i prefer in my method to
get rid of it and prevent bugs is a
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation of pesticide applications and a
spray method sprayed pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applications are my favorite a lot of
people out there don't agree with that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to smoke pesticides they
don't want to smoke chemicals but
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is chemicals if you understand
that and i understand that you may not
[SPEAKER_00]: want to consume some pesticides but we've
got to do what we've got to do to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs away to protect our investment to
make sure that you were delivered a
[SPEAKER_00]: product and my job as the lead cultivator
the consultant also somebody trained by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado Department of Agriculture
it's my job my responsibility also
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who is highly passionate about
cannabis i'm not just a grower i'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: just a breeder i love to smoke the root of
all of this it all started because i love
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke ganja i'm a cannabis consumer i'm
going to smoke everything that we grow at
[SPEAKER_00]: my commercial facility so i keep that in
mind i'm also very passionate about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumers and cannabis patients i
come from the medical marijuana side of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is where i got started i want to
make sure not to get anybody sicker than
[SPEAKER_00]: they already are i don't want to make
anybody sick at all the goal for my
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that i grow is for people to feel
better to have a better quality of life
[SPEAKER_00]: after they consume the product that i
produced so not only am i professionally
[SPEAKER_00]: and ethically responsible but i'm also
personally and passionately invested in
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that these products are safe
so one of my big jobs in the facility is
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that we are safely ethically
and effectively using the correct products
[SPEAKER_00]: at the correct time to get rid of bugs but
also not contaminate any of the product to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it could be problematic for anybody
who may consume the buds the edibles the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates anything that comes out of my
grow i am responsible for that my name is
[SPEAKER_00]: on that product if you look at the jar
where the herb came from it will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the number where that product was produced
here in colorado and if you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and you know the right facilities
you know who grew that shit you could say
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a rasta giant grow you can find
it and you can fucking call me out blame
[SPEAKER_00]: me for whatever you need to blame me for
so i know i do talk a lot about the
[SPEAKER_00]: business side of commercially producing
cannabis it's a big investment it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of responsibility but please never feel
like i've forgotten about the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: about the consumers about the people that
sparked this passion for large-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production in me i grow cannabis
to make people feel better i breed
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to make people feel better that
is the overall goal of this here i have
[SPEAKER_00]: not lost sight of that goal i am involved
in a lot of things i have gone very far
[SPEAKER_00]: from the original root of this project but
i know that the original the whole mission
[SPEAKER_00]: the intent is to make people feel better
and i know that giving you a pesticide on
[SPEAKER_00]: your product is not going to make you feel
better i want you to live longer healthier
[SPEAKER_00]: happier and i can't do that if i poison
you with the fucking pesticide so one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my big things is to make sure that we are
doing this ethically and responsibly that
[SPEAKER_00]: is something i take good pride in so i do
talk about sprayed applications a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are not into the sprays that is
cool do your thing how are you keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs away if you're not using a sprayed
application a lot of people will choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: use predator insects they get other bugs
that do not harm the plants but they do
[SPEAKER_00]: eat the bugs that are there in the grow so
you can get things like lace wings
[SPEAKER_00]: swarski's persimilis hypoaspis miles rove
beetles assassin beetles things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: and you buy them and they come in the mail
and you release them in the grow and those
[SPEAKER_00]: will go and act just like predators out in
the wild they'll eat all of your fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites all your fungus gnats a lot
of people do choose to use ladybugs let me
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about ladybugs briefly i think
they're lazy they're cool if there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs are right here a ladybug may go over
here and eat it but if there's a bug over
[SPEAKER_00]: here and a ladybug over here ladybugs not
going anywhere to fucking eat it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience you'll spend money on ladybugs
you release them into grow into the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll take a bunch of pictures because
they're gorgeous you'll find a couple that
[SPEAKER_00]: are humping there's always ladybugs
humping you'll find them up on the tops of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants you'll take a grit bunch of
great photos and you'll turn off the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and you'll go do your business and
you come in the next day half the ladybugs
[SPEAKER_00]: will be dead they flew into the fucking
light they flew into the fan they flew
[SPEAKER_00]: into the blower ladybugs are pretty but
they are not the smartest fucking creature
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet they're suicidal they're
kamikaze they don't last very long they
[SPEAKER_00]: stink they die they land on the floor and
they stink in my opinion that smell from
[SPEAKER_00]: the dead ladybugs is terrible then you got
to sweep them all up and it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: waste of money i would recommend a more
aggressive more effective predator uh
[SPEAKER_00]: californica swarsky that may be the same
thing they changed the names on these bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: and i can't keep the latin names all
straight in my mind i order them honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: and i can remember the names that i order
the swarsky's the kookamaras uh the
[SPEAKER_00]: californicus the hypoaspis miles green
lace wings rove beetles um what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one that i said assassin beetles um
those are all great predator beetles or
[SPEAKER_00]: predator bugs but just like a pesticide
what i'm about to say applies to predator
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and pesticides you've got to have
the correct uh eradication device for the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct problem if you go releasing the
wrong bug for the wrong bug they may never
[SPEAKER_00]: meet up but if you know what your what
bugs you're facing and you do the right
[SPEAKER_00]: research you can find the correct bug to
go in there and get that bug right away
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem is in my opinion with the
predator bugs is that you've got to build
[SPEAKER_00]: up populations on the same hand it does
take time effort and energy to spray a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide and that does do some stress to
the plants if you're letting out bugs the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants barely know that those bugs are
there but it does take a little while for
[SPEAKER_00]: that army to get out there and start doing
work so you've got your toss up there
[SPEAKER_00]: you're 50 50 let's talk about another way
to get rid of bugs in our grow many people
[SPEAKER_00]: forget that a lot of the bugs we face are
not on the leaves of the plant they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually live down in the soil the cocoa
the medium that's where they go you may
[SPEAKER_00]: see them pop up occasionally and show you
that they're there but they're living down
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil so a soil dredge is another
very effective way to get rid of many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bugs we face oftentimes if we've got a
bug if it's thrips spider mites fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats white flies a lot of the time I have
my first reaction is to defoliate let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just get rid of some of these leaves clean
up the bottoms take off a bunch of leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna help us out that's the first
step then the next step let's do a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: dredge of the appropriate product if I've
got let's just say if I've got fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats I would use 15 to 30 milliliters of
evergreen per gallon of water as a source
[SPEAKER_00]: soil dredge I would run that right through
the pot right through the soil until I get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of runoff that way I know
that all that soil in there has now been
[SPEAKER_00]: poisoned any fungus gnats in there are
gonna get poisoned they're gonna die
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not gonna want to live in there
now the next move I would spray the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with 15 to 30 milliliters per gallon of
evergreen it's down there in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get it up top also that way we
killed everything if there are bugs on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves they're gonna run to the soil
looking for refuge guess what poison down
[SPEAKER_00]: there if there are bugs in the soil
they're gonna run up to the leaves looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for refuge guess what poison up there
let's get them let's get them on all
[SPEAKER_00]: levels let's not give them anywhere to
hide and one thing I want to talk about is
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats those are there because
you're over watering if you stop over
[SPEAKER_00]: watering the fungus gnats will stop coming
around so those should be easy to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of fungus gnats quickly how do you get rid
of fungus gnats defoliate do a soil dredge
[SPEAKER_00]: of either I would just say evergreen let's
just start off right with evergreen you
[SPEAKER_00]: could use as a trawl as a max but I think
evergreen or pyganic which is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar product reduce the dosage of the
pyganic though give it a soil dredge
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate soil dredge foliar feed repeat
in three days fungus gnats are gone bro if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it right the fungus gnats will be
gone maybe repeat a third time the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna look a little bit stressed if
you hit them with that much oil three
[SPEAKER_00]: times but your fucking bugs will be gone
all right where are we let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can do things are really all right
another thing we need to talk about is
[SPEAKER_00]: what phase of growth are our plants in if
we're in veg we can do a lot of things to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants if you're just starting to
flower your options are slimming out if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in flower your options for spray
applications become very thin keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that people are going to consume this we
don't want to put a product on here that
[SPEAKER_00]: is not going to the half life is not going
to come up by the time we consume this
[SPEAKER_00]: product so keep that in mind you don't
want to taste it you don't want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it you definitely don't want it in your
concentrates imagine if I sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: something on your buds and you taste it in
the buds imagine if I put those buds in a
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction device of any kind we're
concentrating the pesticide that shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor as well your dads are going to
taste 20 times worse than the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: taste so think about the stage of growth
you are in and adjust your pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application accordingly something I like
to do in a commercial grow I just said we
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on spray applications yes as soon as
I see bud set guess what I do I release a
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck ton of predator bugs so I've got
sprays all the way up to about day 14
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe day 20 then by day 21 I've got an
army a bunch of boxes of predator bugs to
[SPEAKER_00]: release into the entire growth so I switch
it over to predators later in the season
[SPEAKER_00]: so I start off my grow season with spray
applications once I get buds I do switch
[SPEAKER_00]: over to the predator bugs then I have an
arrangement with the insectiary we
[SPEAKER_00]: basically set up a subscription service to
where those bugs come every week every two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks as needed until I tell them that we
have harvested then they stop selling
[SPEAKER_00]: sending them they just show up in a box
that says live bugs I just start putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them out as soon as they get there build
that population keep those problem bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: away those predators do need to be planned
for they need to be planned ahead you do
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get them there it's gonna take you
if you're new with ordering from the
[SPEAKER_00]: insectiary it may take you two weeks to
get your first batch but after that you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be in the rotation they may have to breed
more bugs for you sometimes they're making
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of bugs they sell these people
know what they're gonna sell they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making that amount they got to step up
their program to get you your order in two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks so be prepared also keep in mind
delivery time also keep in mind somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: got to disperse all of these bugs which is
cool because you can just do the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room or you can really focus on problem
hot spots I've come to a part in my notes
[SPEAKER_00]: where it says PPE we've already talked
about personal protective equipment but
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what once again be safe in the grow
protect yourself personal protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment long sleeves pants shoes goggles
respirator if you need it gloves for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even a tie-back suit come on protect
yourself all right I just want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you're safe and that you go home
to your kids or your dog or your turtle or
[SPEAKER_00]: all six of your cats or whatever you're
doing take care of yourself now I did say
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was going to talk a little bit
about some of the products that I use and
[SPEAKER_00]: do recommend I've got a few disclaimers
here a bunch of rambling to do about this
[SPEAKER_00]: first one nobody pays me I'm not paid by
any fucking companies for any products the
[SPEAKER_00]: only sponsor is the only people that are
in my pocket the only people whose pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in whichever way that goes I do have
an advertising agreement with seeds here
[SPEAKER_00]: now calm I'll be transparent with that if
you're watching on YouTube you don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: get that out I can't put that out on
YouTube because YouTube doesn't agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising for seeds here now calm if
you're listening to the audio there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds here now calm commercial at the
beginning that's the only advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement I've got a range nobody pays me
nothing like that so let's talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: products that I do recommend I talk a lot
about evergreen evergreen is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: product it's a pyrethrin based product it
works on a lot of pests a lot of problems
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of pests it doesn't do a lot of
stress to the plants that's a good product
[SPEAKER_00]: another product I recommend is azamax
another product I recommend is azotrol
[SPEAKER_00]: something else I like a lot is botanigard
max another product I'll recommend is
[SPEAKER_00]: venerate something else I really like is
Monterey garden spray Monterey garden
[SPEAKER_00]: spray has an ingredient in there called
spinosad which is very effective against
[SPEAKER_00]: white flies if you've got white flies hit
it with that Monterey garden spray every
[SPEAKER_00]: three days for like three or four
applications your white flies will be gone
[SPEAKER_00]: you can also do the soil dredge with the
Monterey garden spray get that spinosad in
[SPEAKER_00]: there your white flies will disappear the
spinosad is a fungus a fungus is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria or fungus it's a fungus that
grows on the bottom of whiskey barrels and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've found that that kills white flies
and many other insects other products that
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy are cease I use cease for
powdery mildew I also like regalia I like
[SPEAKER_00]: double nickel I like a product called b52
I really like a product called zero tall
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good for a lot of things you can
clean with it it'll help you get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew it creates that undesirable
environment for your plants and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: use it really late in the game I'm not
gonna give you any time frames another
[SPEAKER_00]: product I really like is the mammoth pea
pest what's it called I know the name of
[SPEAKER_00]: it my brain won't say it anyway the people
that make mammoth pea mammoth makes a pest
[SPEAKER_00]: application pesticide application I know
the name of it my brain will not say it
[SPEAKER_00]: guys at mammoth I apologize your pesticide
application is fucking great and it smells
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful which I don't know is that a
good thing cuz I'm in there going this
[SPEAKER_00]: smells so good I'm just sucking up the
pesticide that could be dangerous but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a mammoth insect control product
my brain will not I apologize because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a good product whatever whatever the name
of that shit is Google mammoth insect
[SPEAKER_00]: mammoth pesticide it'll come up something
I want to wreck one thing I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend is do not use I do not recommend
using botanical oils you see them at all
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow stores all the hydro stores
they're in pretty colored bottles there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a purple one a pink one one's got lavender
one's got rosemary and shit in it I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: like those that flavor ends up in your
buds and it doesn't taste good have you
[SPEAKER_00]: ever like tasted perfume like when a
somebody sprays perfume or cologne in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and you can taste it that's what
botanical oils taste like when you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud that's what they taste like when
you make concentrates don't put that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: in there please also I do not like neem
oil at all get rid of that shit now
[SPEAKER_00]: something I do need to touch on being that
I am certified by the Colorado Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Agriculture to be let me explain my
credentials here since we're in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of a fucking pesticide application podcast
my certification comes from the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: State University also the Colorado
Department of Agriculture I took a class
[SPEAKER_00]: at the university and I was given the
license by the Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture I've got license number 17 I'm
017 and the train the trainer
[SPEAKER_00]: certification program I was trained by a
great person named Thea Walker she gave a
[SPEAKER_00]: great class good teacher a very personable
person so I am certified I am trained the
[SPEAKER_00]: trainer certified which means I can go to
a commercial grow whether it's a farm
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a weed grow if it's tomatoes
if it's soy and I can train the crew and
[SPEAKER_00]: the lead grower in safe pesticide
management application handling and
[SPEAKER_00]: education I am certified by the university
and the Department of Ag to do this I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got paperwork so I am qualified to give
this pesticide information something I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to touch on right now is all of the
products I recommend all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology I've recommended is legal here
in Colorado in a commercial grow I think
[SPEAKER_00]: actually Azimax may have been banned
recently but most of the products I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended are legal and safe here in the
state of Colorado I don't know where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are I don't know the laws we have to work
with the Colorado marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: division the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture and probably
other entities that I'm not even aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got to approve every pesticide
that we use on our products so make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the products you are using are
approved by your state regulators I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what state you're in I don't know
what products you're using don't blame it
[SPEAKER_00]: on me you've got to do that work I'm
telling you what I use what I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: don't let me ruin your license don't let
me fuck up your plans don't get in trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: because of me also I try in my personal
grow to stick to those same standards that
[SPEAKER_00]: are held by the commercial grow sometimes
I'm a little bit more strict but also full
[SPEAKER_00]: disclosure when I get new clones in I
spray it with shit that I will not even
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you because it's not gonna be
consumed it's gonna become a mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna get cloned out a bunch of times
and then 90% of what I grow is not
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed it's turned into seeds so people
aren't smoking most of it so that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different argument right there know those
laws and rules and I've got the word
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine written down because that was
something I already touched on but I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to segue into it now when you do
get new clones new plants make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: treat them so that they can be quarantined
don't put them into general population
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them safe all right let me review my
notes make sure we've covered everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about ways to make sure you don't
get bugs into the room I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative sprays I've talked about
preventative predatory bugs I've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about ways to eradicate those bugs if you
do see that if you do see bugs in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it's time to step up your pest
application keep in mind rotation and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind bugs do build resistance also
multiple modes of attack understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: each pesticide works some pesticides make
the bugs forget to eat some make them
[SPEAKER_00]: forget to breathe some pesticides grow a
mushroom inside of the bug and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom takes over the bug and they
explode understand the method of attack if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get two modes of attack in a
mixture there's nothing wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying two pesticides at the same time
on your plants if if you understand what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in both of those bottles some things you
can't spray together some things will have
[SPEAKER_00]: negative reactions but most of the time
you can mix one two maybe even three
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides together and blast the shit out
of that crop maybe do a tester spray don't
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the whole crop at first but you can
mix things all right I think that does
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap up my integrated pest management
