[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for episode number 117 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_06]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_06]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_06]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_06]: for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_06]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you guys are having a great morning,
great afternoon, a great nighttime,
[SPEAKER_06]: great evening, whatever time it is
wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you got a fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you're taking a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you got a big old fat blunt with a
half a gram of wax down the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you got your girlfriend's hair
straightened around and you're making some
[SPEAKER_06]: rosin and dabbing that tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you're doing, I hope you're
getting lit up with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I'm sending your hit in the
Hitman short stack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to my friends at Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I buy a new rig, I like to buy a rig
made in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy Americans that dab as hard as we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I buy Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitman Glass, made in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys support HitmanGlass
.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, make sure you follow my friend
Dougie on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dougie, at Hitman Glass Dougie on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let him know you're listening to The Girl
From Your Heart podcast and that you heard
[SPEAKER_06]: about Hitman through the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So would Dougie.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I'm also dabbing on the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the e-nail with the drop down on the
Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a replacement coil, so I need to
give a big shout out to my buddy Jason.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to Mod Extractions and Gaia
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends came through and paid me a
visit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They laced me up properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the help.
[SPEAKER_06]: Life is turpy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's all the shout outs I got
for you today, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: On this episode, this is the episode where
I have the lovely Miss Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll drop that in here just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to the Denver Patient Support Group
in Denver at a place called Castleman's
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was granted a 10 minute interview
with the lovely Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll play that here in just a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I get to that, I want to read a
news article.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me turn down the music.
[SPEAKER_06]: This article actually comes from the
ExtractSunTimes.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I found this on the internet, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lately, there have been some revelations
made in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a commercial grow or a
private grow, you may want to hear this.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using a product called Guardian,
you need to get that stuff out of your
[SPEAKER_06]: garden, out of your place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not something you want to be
spraying.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get right into the article here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking for an author here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, written by Emily Gray Brocious.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this article was posted on January 21st
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: A popular pesticide approved last week by
Oregon health officials for use on
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis plants has now been removed from
the list of acceptable marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticides due to detection of a
controversial chemical ingredient as
[SPEAKER_06]: reported by The Oregonian.
[SPEAKER_06]: And guys, this is an article from Oregon,
but soon you will see how this applies to
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: A marijuana testing lab in Eugene found
traces of the chemical abamectin in
[SPEAKER_06]: supposedly organically grown cannabis and
discovered growers had been using a
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticide called Guardian Mite Spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guardian Mite Spray includes natural
ingredients such as lemon oil and cinnamon
[SPEAKER_06]: among its active ingredients and is
marketed as an all-natural product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Abamectin was not listed as an active
ingredient on the product label.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pesticide has become widely popular
because it's more effective than any harsh
[SPEAKER_06]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Neil Bernstein, owner of Roots Garden
Supply, told The Oregonian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it's more effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're lying and they're shitting that
they didn't tell you about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll continue to read.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon's Department of Agriculture has
temporarily removed the product from its
[SPEAKER_06]: list of approved cannabis pesticides until
further investigation can be conducted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Abamectin is commonly used in fruit and
vegetable production, but those produce
[SPEAKER_06]: items are not marketed or sold as organic,
according to Green Rush Daily.
[SPEAKER_06]: Detection of this chemical in allegedly
organic marijuana is problematic because
[SPEAKER_06]: people often pay a higher premium for
organically grown cannabis, especially
[SPEAKER_06]: medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this company was putting out a
pesticide and they were having great
[SPEAKER_06]: success with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was taking down all of the problems,
but they were not listing the abamectin on
[SPEAKER_06]: the label, which is not an organic
compound or chemical, and it was clearly
[SPEAKER_06]: in the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if this was a rule in Colorado,
if this product was banned in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_06]: this was applied to a crop in Colorado and
a lab found this, that crop would be
[SPEAKER_06]: recalled and none of the products made
with the trim or the buds of that crop
[SPEAKER_06]: would be allowed to be sold in a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: The product would all have to be
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_06]: People would lose a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the people for Guardian are held
accountable when that time comes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a gray area because cannabis is
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we can sue for that,
but if crops have to be thrown away
[SPEAKER_06]: because Guardian was applied and there was
an ingredient not listed on the label,
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the folks from Guardian can be held
accountable for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have posted to Facebook that I'm trying
to get in touch with the people from
[SPEAKER_06]: Guardian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their website is gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: The distributors and vendors that I was
aware of for Guardian have disappeared.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot find them.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you work for Guardian or you were a
part of Guardian Might Spray and you'd
[SPEAKER_06]: like to talk to me on behalf of Guardian
on this show and tell us what's up,
[SPEAKER_06]: why that shit wasn't listed on there,
or if you have something to say,
[SPEAKER_06]: I will give you time on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: All you have to do is contact me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an open invitation to come be on
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us know what's going on with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even have to come to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can come to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got portable podcasting equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do it over Skype.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do it over FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do it through a simple phone call.
[SPEAKER_06]: However you guys would like to be on the
show, this is an open invitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know why that was not
listed on the label of your product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you knew it was in there because
you had to pay for it to put it in the
[SPEAKER_06]: product.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody else has Guardian in their
garden or in your garden pantry area,
[SPEAKER_06]: properly dispose of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly do not know the proper
procedure for disposing of a bottle of
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticides, but please do some research
and get rid of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've already applied Guardian to your
personal crop, you should be okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not organic anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't say it was organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a commercial crop and you've
applied Guardian in Colorado, I hope you
[SPEAKER_06]: pass all of the testing when it comes up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, if you're thinking about making
a product for the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_06]: think long-term.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys weren't around very long.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they would have made a product that
worked and put some thought into it and
[SPEAKER_06]: put some heart into it, they'd still be
part of the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd still be giving them our money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, they tried to pull some shit on
us and now they have to hide.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're shunned from the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's ever going to trust these people
again, whoever they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know who they are, you're never
going to buy a product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if you're a sales rep from that
company, people are going to have a hard
[SPEAKER_06]: time trusting you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The legal cannabis industry is just
getting started.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're part of this evolution of the
cannabis industry before it goes
[SPEAKER_06]: nationwide, you would have the opportunity
to be in a huge business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, these guys pretty much just got
blackballed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be a good person.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys, I am going to time warp
us back a few days.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to go to Denver, Colorado to
Castleman's where we had the Denver
[SPEAKER_06]: patient support group with our lovely
speaker, Ms. Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a very great interview.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was the first interview I've ever had
where the person I was interviewing had an
[SPEAKER_06]: assistant who was keeping time.
[SPEAKER_06]: She told me, you have 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the interview started, she put her
hands up and showed me 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: When nine minutes happened, she showed me
nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: When five minutes came around,
she showed me the five.
[SPEAKER_06]: When three minutes came up, I got the
three.
[SPEAKER_06]: About one minute, she kind of gave me the
look, so I knew it was time to wrap up the
[SPEAKER_06]: interview.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms. Charlo was on a tight schedule,
so I do appreciate her for taking a
[SPEAKER_06]: 10-minute chunk out of her night to do an
interview with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's spin back in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to Castleman's in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen, Rasta Jeff and
Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, welcome back, podcast
listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here at the Denver Cannabis Patient
Support Group at Castleman's in Denver,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I am joined on mic by the lovely
Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great event.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of people here already.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of early, and we still are
already getting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're filling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this shows just how excited people
are for this opportunity to share their
[SPEAKER_00]: own experiences and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now that you guys have passed that
barrier that most of the rest of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting for, we're all watching to see
what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that so many people are
taking initiative to educate themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's encouraging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Education, that's the key here tonight,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of vendors here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody has their educational info.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like they're here doing a swap
meet, trying to sell.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the vibe that people have brought.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of an educational and not give
me your money, which is what we've needed
[SPEAKER_06]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a trade show.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for doing that for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like every time we have an event
like this, they're just trying to pull
[SPEAKER_06]: money out of our pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've kind of noticed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, same here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've forgotten what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've forgotten medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've gone all recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've forgotten about the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a patient myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on behalf of all of the Colorado
patients, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I am thrilled to be co-hosting with
Dr. Michelle Ross, who also sits on the
[SPEAKER_00]: board of advisors for MD Herb,
which is a medical marijuana resource.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you guys Google that right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have a website?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, MDHerb.org.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Support that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good cause.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're kind of well known for your fuck
it, I quit statement on the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of my listeners might not be
familiar with who you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you give us maybe a brief history
lesson up to today and then we'll talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about the event?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working as a news anchor in
Anchorage, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became the cannabis reporter and I
learned about the true harm surrounding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to meet the patients that were
being affected by our broken medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that I was probably the only
person with the knowledge and resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and access in order to do something in
order to help so many people that needed
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I created the Alaska Cannabis Club
while still working as a reporter and
[SPEAKER_00]: decided I would build the club up and step
away from my career as a journalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided to do so in a public manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had one of the clubs youngest
patients, his name is Solomon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was battling testicular cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He agreed to not disclose the fact that
me, his interviewer, was also the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: lady he was doing the story about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that pre-tape segment aired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the teleprompter run with something
completely different from what I planned
[SPEAKER_00]: on saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just spoke from my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told everyone that I own the Alaska
Cannabis Club and that I'd be quitting my
[SPEAKER_00]: job to fight for freedom and fairness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as for this job, well, fuck it,
I quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that led to more than 100 million
views, countless headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rallied freedom fighters across the
state of Alaska, across the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Alaska, we got as many people
registered to vote in that short span of
[SPEAKER_00]: time that we had left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there it was all about
education, education, education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we crisscrossed the massive state of
Alaska just sharing our own experiences,
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing where we came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And addressing real concerns that our
neighbors had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led to the legalization of
marijuana in Alaska on November 4th of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for putting your future
and your career on the line.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that didn't work the way it was
supposed to, you could have really put
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself in a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to work, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it just had to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an amazing step to make,
an amazing commitment to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became a journalist because I wanted to
make a difference, and this was an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make a real difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no difference to be made in
journalism because the networks kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: limit you, don't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: They control all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you're telling the truth with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that brings us to today, here at the
Cannabis Patients Support Group.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of talked about it a little bit
ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you give us a bunch of details about
this, and who's here, and what we're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to do today, and what we're going to hear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, cannabis patients from all
walks of life, all different ailments,
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming together and sharing their own
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gathering that's the first of
its kind, where it isn't just Crohn's
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, or patients suffering HIV,
or dealing with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is coming together so that we can
share the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that we're all growing and
learning, and that no one is the end-all
[SPEAKER_00]: expert in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that we all just
continue sharing what we're learning so we
[SPEAKER_00]: get to where we have those direct answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it isn't everyone still feeling their
way through their treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is still a little foggy out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The doctors can't guide you very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got bud tenders and dispensaries
that are basically in charge of your
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine, or caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're talking about medicine and
how this would be handled by someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gone to school for years and years
and can tell you exactly, down to a
[SPEAKER_00]: science, how it's going to be affecting
you, that's what we're working toward as
[SPEAKER_00]: an industry, as a medical marijuana
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of those steps in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really look forward to the talks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to stick around.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to record some of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Richard, give me permission to do some
recording.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to record you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I may add some of that into the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may do some editing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know what will happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may put some of that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Richard Haynes is organizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the founder of MD Herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Michelle Ross is co-hosting the event
along with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have several patients coming up to
share their stories, including Richard
[SPEAKER_00]: Haynes, Bobby West, Ashley Weber,
and a few more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of that will really touch hearts
and open minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to get some of that onto the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it comes out well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I follow you on every social media
outlet that there is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're quite popular on the social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little while back, the Alaskan Cannabis
Club was rated.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very few minutes after that, you went to
Facebook and posted a video.
[SPEAKER_06]: You seemed calmer in that video than you
do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: We just got rated.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least we're here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what's happening now,
then people need to know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we voted to stop something from
happening and police and the authorities
[SPEAKER_00]: are circumventing the will of the voters,
then everyone needs to know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening now so that people can show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did show up because of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times has that club been rated?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been rated twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been rated twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're pretty much comfortable with the
routine now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a horrible experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one should have a gun shoved in their
face because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absurd.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're not hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to heal everybody.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that they felt the need to
send more than a dozen armed officers and
[SPEAKER_00]: SWAT gear into my home to put guns in all
of our faces, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that shows that we're still fighting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look like a pretty badass criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So threatening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're definitely going to be one of
the violent offenders.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was impressed with how calmly you
went on Facebook just minutes after.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, we just got rated.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was definitely impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that has to be a little bit of reporter
experience, but I'm sure that's just your
[SPEAKER_06]: character.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've done a lot of interview questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to just have a little bit
of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you prefer to consume your
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going for a calming effect,
then I like a CBD spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: She just sprayed a couple pumps of CBD
spray into her mouth and nobody noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I want to just relax and chill,
then of course I, well, yeah, I just like
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you take dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen that yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll have to take a dab with you
eventually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen you smoke plenty of blunts and
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's blunts that are preferable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoke what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, and I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's blunts.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's going to tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had no hesitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you like the Sativa headbust sort of
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything that it stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time that I light up, I'm reminded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reminded of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That we should all be supporting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep on fighting.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day, keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never give up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you going to be here for the 420
events in Denver during the Cannabis Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was here last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first Cannabis Cup period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were way too many people around you
for me to get to you to say hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were popular that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it was quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to do it all again.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're there, we're going to smoke
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We may do another round two of this
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's plan on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was going to make sure that I
let you get all of your plugs in and
[SPEAKER_06]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell everybody how we can find you on
social media and your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can, of course, find me at
CharloGreen.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll contain all the links to my social
media, Facebook, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're constantly working on producing
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see video from tonight on
CharloGreen.com in just a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get used to that constant
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking cameras along and giving
you guys the opportunity to take in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I am blessed to to be receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CharloGreen.com is one outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also my main project right now is
GoGrain.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's green with an E at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about cultivating diversity,
unity and opportunity in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing is having these sorts
of events, looking for leaders in diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that want to stand up and
champion the movement for the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: that they share their own homes with,
their community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so GoGrain.org.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you support it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you follow around all the social
media outlets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you her assistant?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that your official title?
Not official title, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you are today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today you're going to be her assistant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her assistant is giving me the it's time
to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to let you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for joining me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to seeing your
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be right back to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I feel like that went pretty well.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my 10 minute interview with
Charlo Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys enjoyed that as much as I
did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to send a huge thank you shout out
to Charlo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the interview.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also thank you for treating me like a
VIP for the entire evening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also big thanks to Richard from
HerbMD.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me permission to record the entire
event.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, I recorded the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the sound quality was not
super good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not their fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just used my Zoom H6 little XY mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't pick it up real well.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of room noise.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of conversation in the back
of the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not going to torture you guys by
making you listen to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do recommend that you go to a Denver
patient support group if you ever get the
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is a medical marijuana support
group in your area, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_06]: that you go to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go mingle with the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go hear the testimony of these people
whose lives are being dramatically
[SPEAKER_06]: improved by using medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Several patients took the stage to speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one patient that really stood out in
my mind was a young man who said that he
[SPEAKER_06]: had the opportunity to move to Colorado
and use medical cannabis to feel better.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he feels much better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now he's able to run.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's able to play.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's able to jump.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's able to be a normal kid with energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the only downfall is that now he
doesn't care to do that because all of his
[SPEAKER_06]: friends are in his home state where they
do not allow medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can go to these meetings.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can hear this testimony.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't believe in the power of
medical cannabis, go to one of these
[SPEAKER_06]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hear one of these children talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some of these adults talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these people developed these
conditions at adulthood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these people were in car accidents
and developed conditions then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these people were born with
conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go and listen to what these people
say, you will be a believer of medical
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the people listening to this show
already support cannabis anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Preaching to the choir, it feels like,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I want to thank everybody for
listening to the show.
