[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm smoking GG4 Ambrosia from our
friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this product contains 68.8%
THC and 79.1% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of the GG4.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the aroma, I like the flavors,
and I definitely like the funky buzz that
[SPEAKER_00]: it gives me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets my body nice and high,
it makes my head nice and stony,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think it is great podcast
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious GG4
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, in this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to talk about some of the most
mistakes I have made in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, I'd like to give
a shout out to a few of our friends from

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I said that in
this episode, we were going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the biggest mistakes that I have
made in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I would like to ask
you for your email submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the biggest mistakes or
what is the biggest mistake you have made
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the biggest
mistakes you have made in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by sharing our mistakes,
we will do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we will humble ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will remind ourselves that we are human
and we do fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how much you practice,
no matter how good you think you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter how prepared you are,
sometimes shit goes wrong and we do make
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel like me coming on here and
talking about some of the major mistakes
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made as a beginner grower,
as an experienced grower, and I've even
[SPEAKER_00]: made mistakes in giant commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like coming on here and talking
about my mistakes and admitting those
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes will build a better bond between
you and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you a better trust with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will say, hey, that guy was a noob.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy made mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will show you that even though you
were making mistakes as a newer grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you still do have the potential to become
a great grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the potential to become a
commercial level grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode will build a better bond
between us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will help us build confidence
and this episode will also humble many
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the mistakes I
have made in a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started growing, I was really
into using grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great setup for my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was better than modifying the house in
which I lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started with grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with one tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I expanded to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you knew it, I had a tent with
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a tent for vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I had two tents for a perpetual
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I did very well taking
care of my tents, but those tents led to
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my biggest mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not blaming the grow tent in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you a little bit about what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my grow tents were in one big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked starting the day by opening all of
the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would let the air from the fans
blow around the entire room and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: all get a lot of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like the plants were really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were getting a lot of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no stagnant air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity was just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature was just right in that
entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: My normal routine for that room was to
open all of the tents, water all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, leave the tents open throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they could have a lot of nice
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just before the plants went off
for the night, I would go in the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: I would seal up all of the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way my flowering plants wouldn't get
any light in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by sealing the other tents,
I would make sure that the light wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get out and do another preventative
measure to make sure my flowering plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't receive any light during their night
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time that plan worked
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an alarm set.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants were to turn off at nine o
'clock, I would set an alarm for 830 so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could go to the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could make sure nothing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything needed water, I could water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything needed adjustments,
I could adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any equipment was failing, I could see
that it was messed up and I could repair
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I could close up those tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants would go to sleep and I could
continue with my evening, go to sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up the next morning, open the tent
and reset the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: One night I made a huge mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of you can already tell
what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember exactly what happened
because it was a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I fell asleep with every tent in that
grow room open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several hours after my flowering lights
had gone off, I woke up in a panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew immediately that I had fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran to the grow room and just as I had
suspected, my flowering lights were off,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the grow tents were all wide open and
all of my veg lights were still on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my flowering plants were now
experiencing an interrupted dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just in case we have some new growers
listening, what I did is a serious
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake, interrupting the dark cycle at
all will create problems in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interrupted the dark cycle for at least
four to six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plants thought that it was daytime
for an extra six hours that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the exact type of mistake that
will cause our plants to hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the exact type of mistake that
will generate unwanted seeds in our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important things to a
successful seedless cannabis crop is an
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I completely fucked that up by falling
asleep with my grow tents open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still a fairly new and experienced
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't exactly sure what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I could think of doing was
immediately closing up my flowering rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: closing up those bedrooms and making sure
those plants went back on their regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I got really lucky that that
mistake happened later in flower because I
[SPEAKER_00]: got a few seeds, but I did not ruin the
entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that mistake had happened earlier in
flower, I would have ruined an entire crop
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entire grow tent, that five by five
grow tent would have been filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have wasted all of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have wasted all of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have wasted all of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have wasted all of the time that I
had put into those plants and I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: wasted all of the electricity from the
lights that I was pumping into those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have had useless buds at the end
and I would have had a bunch of shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that nobody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got really lucky that I made my
mistake late enough in flower to not seed
[SPEAKER_00]: my entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But had I made that mistake 10 or 14 days
earlier, I could have potentially seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: that entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a beginner, that is one of the first
major mistakes I do remember making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell asleep with my grow tents open and
my veg lights contaminated my flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle and I got a few seeds in my crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people may ask, what
happened to those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do with those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds, in my opinion, were
undesirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were probably thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't like to give away or share
seeds that are made on accident that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from a light contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that is good karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not good practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do anything with them,
grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spread those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I was a medical marijuana
provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a couple of people that relied on
me for quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of friends that were a
little bit frustrated with me because
[SPEAKER_00]: their medical marijuana supply for the
month had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would put their buds in a grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd grind it up and they'd hear tink,
tink, tink, tink, tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would just look at me like,
you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned I did make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know now to not fall asleep with my
grow room open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about another mistake I have
made in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I mixed up a large batch of
nutrients that were meant for a flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This flowering room had just been flipped
to the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that nutrient mix, I added a product
that is used to encourage and promote
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid onset of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been perfect for my
freshly flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have sped them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have seen buds set a little bit
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product also slows down the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I was doing a really good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fed those flowering plants that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went about my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was done watering that flowering
room, I mixed up nutrients to water my veg
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it happened, but I got
mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used the wrong bucket to water my
veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I accidentally poured that product that
is used to initiate flower onto my
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative plants, which triggered them to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point I had plants underneath a
vegetative light in a veg room on a veg
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule that were showing full
pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were starting to show the
little dandelion bud sets while they were
[SPEAKER_00]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was all caused by one incorrect
feed with one incorrect product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like a big deal that
maybe some plants flower 10, maybe 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days, maybe 21 days early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: My flowering room is filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't turn my veg room into a flowering
room to accommodate these plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is where I keep my mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got plants that are going into
flower and I don't have room for them for
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 10, maybe 20 more days,
depending on when that crop in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: them finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in scramble mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to figure out what to do with my
next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was I going to sacrifice that crop because
I ruined it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was I just going to scrap it and throw all
those plants away and cut fresh clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: then wait the two weeks for the clones to
root and then wait two or three weeks for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to veg to catch up to the size they
were?
[SPEAKER_00]: At that rate I'll fall behind on my
perpetual schedule and I won't have plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room and I'll have a room empty for
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the crop that is supposed to come up
right behind that that is probably already
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cloner is going to be behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to throw everything off rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by accidentally feeding my veg plants
the wrong nutrients, I fucked everything
[SPEAKER_00]: up in my grow for at least two full
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to rethink everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to reschedule everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to regroup and start fresh and get a
whole new plan for the rest of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: for my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I do have my grow spaces planned
out for at least the next six to 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing on a production
schedule, you should know what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening for at least the next two or
three, maybe four or five crops in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about it, a flowering cycle
eats up two full months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can plan an entire year's worth of
growing just by thinking about three to
[SPEAKER_00]: six full cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to run a nine week
flowering cycle in your flowering room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pull 5.7 harvests per year,
but that is only going to work if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: on a very tight schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run a 60 day cycle, you will be
able to pull off six full crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only if you do not miss one single day
in that flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my world, scheduling is very
important when it comes to commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scheduling is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a huge mistake that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fed my vegetative plants flowering
nutrients and it sent those little bitches
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower way too early, which caused
chaos in my grow room for at least two
[SPEAKER_00]: more full cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful when you're mixing your
nutrients for your plants and pay very
[SPEAKER_00]: close attention to each product you pour
into your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is starting to feel kind of
like a confession or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I am over here admitting all of my
grow room sins or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have quite a few more mistakes that
we can talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a mistake that I have
made once or twice and I will never make
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made the mistake of getting a clone
from either a friend or a dispensary and I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought that clone into my grow room
without treating it for every pest and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a clone, from a dispensary
or a friend, be sure to treat that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: for every pest and pathogen that you can
imagine before introducing that clone to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general population in your grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I strongly recommend treating any incoming
plants for pests and pathogens before they
[SPEAKER_00]: are introduced to general population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest keeping any new plants in
quarantine for at least a week until you
[SPEAKER_00]: can be sure they are problem-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever you get a new plant,
treat it for pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your integrated pest
management program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how organic you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how nuclear you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you bring in a new clone,
I suggest blasting the shit out of it for
[SPEAKER_00]: every problem you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat it like it does have bugs and
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that clone away from your mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that clone away from your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to wash your hands and change your
clothes before you interact with the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of your garden until you are certain that
that new incoming clone is pest and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call that setting yourself up
for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute you get that clone is when your
success can begin or when your failure can
[SPEAKER_00]: begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the option to get super
excited and race home with your new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it in a new pot so it matches all
of your other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a nice fancy label on it so it's got a
cute name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put it right in the grow room
right next to all of the other plants so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can look just like the rest of
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I just got a brand new cut of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about three to five, maybe seven days
later, you start noticing that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some weird shit happening in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are these leaves yellow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this plant drooping?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's going on over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just brought in russet mites and they
came from that clone that you did not
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine, that clone that you did not
spray, that clone that you were not
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice, my guidance to you is to
treat every single plant coming into your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as if it were infested with every bug
imaginable and every sort of pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to treat one plant,
but it is a pain in the ass to treat the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that one plant, spray the shit out
of it, quarantine it, inspect it for four
[SPEAKER_00]: or five, maybe seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you are absolutely sure that that
plant is clean, put it in general
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it be a part of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were some mistakes I made as a
rookie grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into some things that I have
fucked up in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am responsible for large commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the facilities I work with have
around 100 flowering lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the facilities I work with have as
many as five to 700 flowering lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me a lot of opportunity to make
a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to minimize mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep a lot of notes and I try to pay a
lot of attention and I try to follow a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of standard operating procedures,
but sometimes shit does go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the things I
have fucked up in a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a tradition that when I
take over a new facility, that the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: christen that facility is by flooding the
fuck out of that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see how much water a building
can hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to test the floor drains in a
building as soon as I take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but it seems like as
soon as I take over a grow within the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two or three weeks, I always tend to
flood the damn facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually have something like a usually
at least a 100 gallon reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a 250, maybe a 500 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we're working with a thousand or
a 2,500 gallon reservoir and it takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long time to fill those reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this really good habit of turning
on the water and deciding I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: do some other shit while this fills up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it feels like it's usually two,
three minutes right after that thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize, hey, I left water on and I've
got a thing filling up and I go running
[SPEAKER_00]: back and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fucking flood in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like my gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my super moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get a couple of squeegees and a
mop and you open the doors, get some fans,
[SPEAKER_00]: just get everything dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a setback, but it seems to be a
tradition and it's sort of like a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe I'm making my mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm hazing the new facility,
but whatever it is, it feels like whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: I get comfortable about that two month
mark, I really enjoy just overflowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir and flooding the shit out of a
new facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it may not sound like overflowing a
reservoir is a huge deal to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, but keep in mind when I work in a
commercial facility, some of my water
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies can put out approximately 30 to
50 gallons of water per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the opportunity to put 30 to
50 gallons of water on the floor in as
[SPEAKER_00]: little as one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can cause a huge problem really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm way too experienced and I've
been doing this way too long to make silly
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes like overflowing a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason I am still doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a major mistake that I have
made and it seems like I will continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: make in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about one more mistake that I
made and then I should wrap this up so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I don't get myself banned from
working in the commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to be afraid to hire me
because they know that I fuck up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least I'm not afraid to admit my
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a mistake that I have
made on multiple occasions in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: grow environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done this in home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done this in small scale commercial
environments and I have done this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: large commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something we like to mess
up quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I suggest
using cloning machines, an aeroponic type
[SPEAKER_00]: of cloner, the kind that sprays water up
from the bottom onto the plants to where
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates nice aerated bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants grow nice roots that dangle
down into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the type of cloner I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like an easy cloner or the
botanic hair power cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all basically the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is what I recommend in a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mistake I often make with those easy
cloner machines is every day at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning and the end of the shift,
I like to turn the cloner off by
[SPEAKER_00]: unplugging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I lift up the lid and I put a pH
meter and an EC meter inside the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see what my pH is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my pH is off, I adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also check and see what the EC of that
solution is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the EC is incorrect, I adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also check and see that the water level
is just to the base of the halo and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the sprayers are not clogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I have done my full cloner
inspection, I've checked my pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've checked my EC, I've made the proper
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I put the lid back on the
cloner and I plug the machine back in and
[SPEAKER_00]: I go about my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: One big mistake that I used to make way
too often when doing my cloner inspection
[SPEAKER_00]: was I would check everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do all of my adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would write everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put the lid back on the cloner and
then I would walk away without plugging
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a huge, costly mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I catch that mistake in one hour,
I should be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I catch it in two hours, we'll be all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three hours, you're kinda pushing your
luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't check on that cloner for four
hours, you're gonna cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't check on it in five and six
hours, shit's gonna go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't check on it before you leave
the facility for the end of the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: you wait until tomorrow to come back to
start the shift, all of your clones are
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we don't cut
a couple of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, we generally
cut 128 clones at a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: My small cloner is 128 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to fill that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to cut half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I killed clones, I am probably
killing at least 100 clones at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what can make this even worse is a lot
of times, I've had all of my cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: machines plugged into one power strip and
I used the on-off switch on that power
[SPEAKER_00]: strip to turn them all off and on during
my inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have plugged in five easy cloners
into one power strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gone and done my end of the shift
cloner inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the lid back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down that the pH was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down that the EC was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down that I just added a little
bit of clear res because we do that every
[SPEAKER_00]: three to five days to prevent any sort of
algae buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I walked away from all of those
cloning machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clocked out and I went home for the
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I showed up for work the next day,
I had five cloning machines full of dead
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of them died because I
did not turn that power strip back on
[SPEAKER_00]: after I did my cloner inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge and costly mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, those clones were new so they
hadn't started rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only sent me back two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also set me back the amount of time
that it took me to recut all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: cloners worth of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically paid my staff an entire day to
cut a bunch of clones so that I could kill
[SPEAKER_00]: them three days later and repay them to
recut all of those clones all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very lucky that in a commercial
environment, I had a lot of very large
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants to pull those clones from.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a smaller grow environment,
your mother plants may not be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide enough clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have been shit out of luck in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful with your cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using an easy cloner,
if you're using a turbo cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: an auto cloner, any sort of aero cloner,
be sure to turn that thing back on after
[SPEAKER_00]: you make any adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are using the old fashioned
trays and plugs and domes, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: put that dome back on correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a little gap at the edge,
all of your water will escape,
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones will dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another mistake we can talk
about I have made several times in my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about leaving the dome off of
our clones for way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you've got a clone dome and it is time
to start burping your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just now developing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give them 15 to 30 minutes of
fresh air every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take that dome off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let the air blow around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in about 30 minutes, you go and you
put that dome right back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully your plants start to
develop stronger roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You increase that open interval a little
bit over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually those plants can survive
without the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: One mistake that a lot of people like to
make is you take that dome off and you go
[SPEAKER_00]: get stoned and you forget to put the dome
back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come back like two hours later and
your plants are all crispy, dead and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very simple mistake to make in a
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to take the dome off of
your clones, set a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is addicted to their iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set a timer on your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your phone will set a timer without you
pressing any buttons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask your phone to remind you when
15 minutes have passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, hey, Siri, in 15 minutes,
remind me to put the lid back on the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she will say, OK, in 15 minutes,
I will remind you to put the lid back on
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones and you won't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all addicted to our phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a couple of other common
mistakes that I am admitting to having
[SPEAKER_00]: done way too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have killed clones by not plugging in
the clone machine again, and I have killed
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of clones by not putting the dome
back on after their burping period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't forget about your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from my mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you don't have to suffer the
same traumatic experiences that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: suffered in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is enough grow room mistake
confessions for one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing about your
biggest grow room mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart

[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to all of the submissions
and I will keep you anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say Bill from St. Louis
ruined every girl he ever worked in by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep your identity secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep you anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to embarrass anybody by
doing an episode about people's mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal here is to help other growers to
not make these same mistakes that other
[SPEAKER_00]: people have made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if we tell them the mistakes
that we've ran into, the problems we've
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced, we can give them a little bit
of warning and they'll look out and not
[SPEAKER_00]: make the same mistakes that we are making.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ultimate goal here in this episode and
in this entire podcast is to make
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's grow experience more enjoyable
and to improve the quality of everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: overall finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start wrapping up this
podcast while I'm still employable.
