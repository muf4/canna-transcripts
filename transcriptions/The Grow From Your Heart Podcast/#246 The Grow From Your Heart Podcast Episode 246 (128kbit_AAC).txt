[SPEAKER_12]: Unlike Denver County, this one does not
require that commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: cultivation be confined inside,
and a stroll through the four fields
[SPEAKER_12]: planted with 55 strains shows what a
difference the bright southern Colorado
[SPEAKER_12]: sun makes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Plants here grow much taller and heavier,
and they need to be tied to stakes just to
[SPEAKER_12]: stay upright.
[SPEAKER_12]: The high elevation increase and increase
in ultraviolet rays tricks the plant into
[SPEAKER_12]: higher resin production, explains Erin
Hovey, head grower at Los Suenos,
[SPEAKER_12]: and the natural sunlight is virtually
year-round.
[SPEAKER_12]: Still, the area can get cold, so when the
winter frost hits Los Suenos and outdoor
[SPEAKER_12]: growing becomes unfeasible, Hovey and his
team operate in four greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_12]: a more eco-friendly alternative to the
light bulb warehouse setups in Denver.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hovey grew up in North Carolina,
where he started growing marijuana
[SPEAKER_12]: outdoors as a teenager.
[SPEAKER_12]: Despite the objections of his parents and
local law enforcement, he honed his craft
[SPEAKER_12]: there before finding a legal haven in
Pueblo County, where he now nurtures the
[SPEAKER_12]: lives of more than 10,000 marijuana
plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no playbook to growing pot like
this, and there are no guarantees with
[SPEAKER_12]: growing in the natural elements,
but that's what makes it fun, Hovey says.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't be successful at this without
good help.
[SPEAKER_12]: When the hail and mold hits, you need
people who know what they are doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hovey is just one of many Coloradans who
moved to Pueblo to work with illegal
[SPEAKER_12]: marijuana, but locals are getting in on
the action, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: More than 1,300 jobs were created in
Pueblo County in 2014 by the marijuana
[SPEAKER_12]: industry, according to a study by the
Southern Colorado Growers Association,
[SPEAKER_12]: a staffing firm that helps people land
marijuana jobs, opened in Pueblo last
[SPEAKER_12]: February.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, industrial vacancies
decreased by more than 15%, and
[SPEAKER_12]: marijuana-related businesses accounted for
36% of new commercial building projects in
[SPEAKER_12]: Pueblo County in 2014, according to the
Pueblo County Regional Building
[SPEAKER_12]: Department.
[SPEAKER_12]: Folks are quickly realizing that the cost
of cultivation is a lot less in
[SPEAKER_12]: greenhouses and outdoors, says Pueblo
County Commissioner Sal Pace, who has
[SPEAKER_12]: championed the marijuana industry as a
form of economic growth in the area.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a very sizable rural agrarian
portion here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I've never read that word before,
and I probably should have.
[SPEAKER_12]: When Coloradans voted to legalize the
growing and selling of recreational
[SPEAKER_12]: marijuana, they also agreed to allow towns
and counties to choose whether or not to
[SPEAKER_12]: allow retail pot businesses within their
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_12]: Denver already the state epicenter of
medical marijuana quickly became the first
[SPEAKER_12]: retail marijuana capital of the world,
while much of the rest of the state
[SPEAKER_12]: struggled over the decision of whether to
accept pot businesses and, if so,
[SPEAKER_12]: how to regulate them.
[SPEAKER_12]: But Pace and his fellow commissioners were
keen on the idea of an agricultural
[SPEAKER_12]: marijuana economy early on and began
issuing cultivation licenses in 2014 in
[SPEAKER_12]: hopes of spurring local industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are now cultivation licenses for 33
medical operations and 57 recreational
[SPEAKER_12]: operations in Pueblo and Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me clarify for people that are not
from Colorado, and there was a couple of
[SPEAKER_12]: things in that sentence I want to clarify.
[SPEAKER_12]: It says there are now cultivation licenses
for 33 medical operations and 57
[SPEAKER_12]: recreational operations.
[SPEAKER_12]: Recreational and medical are grown in
completely different areas.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if a grow applies to be a legalized
grow with the MED, the Marijuana
[SPEAKER_12]: Enforcement Division, they either apply to
be a medical grow or a recreational grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just the difference in licensing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's how your plant count adds up.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's how your cannabis is handled.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if your medicine, if the cannabis is
grown in a medical facility, it can only
[SPEAKER_12]: be sold to medical retail facilities.
[SPEAKER_12]: If the cannabis is grown in a recreational
facility, it can only be sold in a
[SPEAKER_12]: recreational retail establishment.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why they make the indication
there if it's a recreational or a medical
[SPEAKER_12]: marijuana facility.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also they talk about Pueblo and Pueblo
West County.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are on the border of each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are a bunch, I think there are
14 or 15 dispensaries in Pueblo West,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is just a small short quick drive
from the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually worked in Pueblo West and I
live in the South side of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it used to take me just 15 or 20
minutes to get there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not like it's a distance.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the city of Pueblo does not allow any
cannabis sales within city limits.
[SPEAKER_12]: So everything that is sold is just in
Pueblo County and Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I've gotten off on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get back to the article.
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, although the city of Pueblo
allows cultivation, it's been more guarded
[SPEAKER_12]: in its approach to sales.
[SPEAKER_12]: Recreational pot shops are still under a
moratorium in the city until a public vote
[SPEAKER_12]: on the matter in November of 2016.
[SPEAKER_12]: So residents need to purchase their pot at
one of the 13 recreational shops in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_12]: County where retail sales are legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Pueblo City Council is starting to
come around on the medical side,
[SPEAKER_12]: however, and the first MMJ dispensary
within Pueblo city limits opened in
[SPEAKER_12]: October.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pueblo natives Steven and Monique Duran,
who've been together for 13 years,
[SPEAKER_12]: started looking into medical marijuana
businesses several years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: He started studying medical marijuana
after his shift at the Comanche power
[SPEAKER_12]: plant, while Monique became a regulatory
rules whiz.
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally, after finding one of the rare
buildings in Pueblo that met all of the
[SPEAKER_12]: city's stringent zoning requirements for
the marijuana operation, which include the
[SPEAKER_12]: location and a small council approved
industrial zone, the Duran's poured their
[SPEAKER_12]: savings into a lease for the building,
which is now the 719 MMJ dispensary.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a map the city had for us in
order to meet the requirements,
[SPEAKER_12]: and it was very, very limited.
[SPEAKER_12]: We found this place, which met all of
them, Monique says.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now it's us and one employee running
the store.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just a couple, but we want to be the
model for how to properly medicate
[SPEAKER_12]: patients in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_12]: There won't be many competitors following
that model, though, since zoning maps,
[SPEAKER_12]: the zoning map is so restrictive that only
a few more medical dispensaries might
[SPEAKER_12]: manage to find a suitable spot within the
city.
[SPEAKER_12]: The couple's inspiration for 719 came from
watching Steven's sister struggle through
[SPEAKER_12]: the difficulties of multiple sclerosis and
seeing how pharmaceutical marijuana
[SPEAKER_12]: medication affected her.
[SPEAKER_12]: She was just a different person on those
meds, says Steven.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing what real patients have to fight
through was some strong motivation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now these homegrown owners are happy with
what they've created, just coming in the
[SPEAKER_12]: shop and looking around as two kids from
Pueblo who never really had much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes it's like a dream, Monique says.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's such a cool story, and we hope to
make it a better one.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a big shout out to Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: Several years ago, like the article said,
this town was falling apart.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I used to tell people that I'm from
Pueblo, Colorado, they would laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_12]: They would not take me seriously.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now when I'm in Denver or Colorado Springs
and I say that I am from Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of people are like, oh, you got a
lot of weed going on down there,
[SPEAKER_12]: don't you?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're starting to get a little bit
of respect in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: So big shout out to The Westward.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for publishing an article about us.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, I need to take a drink,
and then I will be right back to talk a
[SPEAKER_12]: little bit about how I got into the
cannabis industry hang time.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_12]: I took a drink as promised, and as any
good dabber would do, I took a couple of
[SPEAKER_12]: fat dabs while I was off the mic,
spared you the coughing into the
[SPEAKER_12]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I was dabbing, I want to share this
with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the package?
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a little bit of LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's LA Confidential crossed to some OG
Kush, but this is PHO Wax.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of the time I'm smoking BHO.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of the shatter and dabs that you see
available on the market right now are made
[SPEAKER_12]: with butane.
[SPEAKER_12]: This hash was made with propane.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me open up some shatter that was made
with butane so that I can compare them
[SPEAKER_12]: side by side and kind of give you a little
better description of what I'm working
[SPEAKER_12]: with here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the shatter, most of you guys are
familiar with shatter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shatter is an amber colored, sort of a
honey colored slab of shatter.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little thin sheet of real,
if I bend it, it cracks, like it'll just
[SPEAKER_12]: pop off and some of it will chip off and
go flying away.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're watching Jurassic Park,
all those big slabs of like the amber
[SPEAKER_12]: resin that the bugs are kept in,
that the bugs are stuck in, that is what
[SPEAKER_12]: shatter looks like in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that stuff looks like shatter.
[SPEAKER_12]: So compared to the shatter, I'm going to
open up this PHO and take a look.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is propane honey oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like, and it looks like a piece
of soap.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really lightly colored.
[SPEAKER_12]: It almost resembles, since it's holiday
time, this looks like a small piece of
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda's peanut butter fudge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if somebody cut Amanda's peanut
butter fudge perfectly smooth,
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would look just like this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just noticed that there was a kind of a
shitty technical difficulty with my
[SPEAKER_12]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I apologize if part of the show was
subpar quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is not my style.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll do my best to fix it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just noticed that there wasn't
something working properly.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shout out to the failed cable.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty sure it's just an XLR cable that
needs to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I was talking about this hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm picking some of it up right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is much easier to handle and deal
with and work with than shatter.
[SPEAKER_12]: A shatter is real sticky.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll stick to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you break it, it'll break off.
[SPEAKER_12]: When your fingers heat it up, it gets kind
of goopy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm holding onto this PHO and I am able to
break off little dabs for myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm able to break off big ass dabs for
myself and little dabs for my friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's much easier to handle.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just took a few dabs of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing that I can really say,
this stuff is flavorful.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got a really sweet, really dank
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't even properly describe the flavor
of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got a cushy flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: The essence of cannabis is really in the
PHO.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was skeptical at first, but a friend of
mine that works at a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_12]: she convinced me that I wanted to try some
of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I grabbed myself a gram and you know
what?
[SPEAKER_12]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let me give a shout out to the company
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't usually do this because I am
affiliated with another facility,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I am going to give a huge shout out to
the Kraft Concentrates for their LA Kush
[SPEAKER_12]: PHO Wax.
[SPEAKER_12]: This stuff is tasty and I do approve.
[SPEAKER_12]: So a big shout out to my friend Jessica
for convincing me to pick up a gram.
[SPEAKER_12]: What up Jess?
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate the recommendation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody buy some, take dabs of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I said I was going to come back and
choke into the microphone a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was gross.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I said I was going to come back
and talk a little bit about how I got
[SPEAKER_12]: myself into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me get into that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm grabbing, I wrote a couple of little
notes here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing major.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just took a couple of little bullet
points while I was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to say that I was in the
cannabis industry illegally before the
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis industry ever existed,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how much of this I should
talk about or admit, but we're beyond
[SPEAKER_12]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: The statute of limitations is probably
gone if I admit to any criminal activity.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, when I moved here from California,
I was going to high school here and our
[SPEAKER_12]: little crew was on a camping trip and
somebody pulled out a pipe and we started
[SPEAKER_12]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, nice, some weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I hadn't seen weed since I'd left
California.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we got stoned.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I was like, all right,
all my friends smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: That means we're going to have to find
somewhere to buy weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And none of our crew really had a weed guy
yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I knew that a couple of the guys at
school were hustling weed, but they didn't
[SPEAKER_12]: really, there were some racial tensions
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: At my school back in that time,
the Mexican guys hung out with the Mexican
[SPEAKER_12]: guys and the white guys hung out with the
white guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we didn't fight or anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just kind of what those groups did.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was no reason for us to mix.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were over here listening to Green Day
and Nirvana and Phish.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were over there listening to,
I don't even know, to Cypress Hill is one
[SPEAKER_12]: of the things I remember they listened to
a whole bunch of.
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, I was brave enough to hit up
one of the Mexican guys that I knew sold
[SPEAKER_12]: weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, Hey, can you sell me some
weed?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was kind of leery about it at
first, but he's like, yep, you have to buy
[SPEAKER_12]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_12]: And at that time we were just high school
kids.
[SPEAKER_12]: So an ounce was a little bit of a stretch.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I made it happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: I bought an ounce and I started hustling a
little bit of that herb to my friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then those guys were heavily connected
and they were like, you're moving ounces.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to start moving pounds now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they started throwing me pounds for
dirty, dirty cheap around here in this
[SPEAKER_12]: town.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the cheapest hookup on pounds around
here for a while until one day I was
[SPEAKER_12]: selling a pound on the East side of town.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a couple of guys with face tattoos and
assault rifles walked up to my car and
[SPEAKER_12]: they did not take my shit from me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was so amazed, but they told me that I
was not allowed to be selling my product
[SPEAKER_12]: on that side of town.
[SPEAKER_12]: That I was able to sell my product on the
North and South ends of town, but don't
[SPEAKER_12]: fuck with the East and West side.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if they see me again, they're going to
take all my shit from me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they sent me home nicely.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I kind of just became the street dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hustled the brick weed, the Mexican
brick weed from a couple of friends that
[SPEAKER_12]: were just flooding it to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So since, since none of the other white
guys in my neighborhood wanted to talk to
[SPEAKER_12]: these Mexican guys, I was just getting
pounds from the Mexican guys and just
[SPEAKER_12]: selling it to all my gringo friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was working out for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of where I made my break
into the weed scene.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I learned how to hustle.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of that is a fictional tale.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you were involved in any sort of law
enforcement, I just made that up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm writing a book and that is all going
to be in the fictional book I'm writing.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how's that feel?
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So then let's see, I'm smoking and
hustling and doing my thing several years
[SPEAKER_12]: go by.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually I learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a guy that lived in the same
apartment building as me when I was like
[SPEAKER_12]: seven years old and that guy was growing
weed in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would listen to his conversations
between my friend Wayne and my uncle Eric
[SPEAKER_12]: and this dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they would talk about how to grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like somewhere between seven and
10 years old when I lived there and I
[SPEAKER_12]: absorbed so much information from that
conversation that I felt like I was
[SPEAKER_12]: destined to grow weed at some point in
time.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we jumped way forward into the early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't even tell you exactly which
year.
[SPEAKER_12]: A friend of mine was growing some weed in
Colorado and he needed a hand.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I went and helped him out.
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't let me do a whole bunch,
but he let me, he exposed me to some
[SPEAKER_12]: things.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I learned how to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got good at that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I moved to Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_12]: That just for unrelated reasons,
for musical reasons.
[SPEAKER_12]: I chased a band.
[SPEAKER_12]: I chased the dream of a band.
[SPEAKER_12]: Being in a band and went and played in
Lawrence, Kansas for several years,
[SPEAKER_12]: traveled around the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, a friend of mine there had a
place where we would play music.
[SPEAKER_12]: And one day I was playing the drums and I
looked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why I looked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're playing the drums,
your eyes just wander.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your eyes just go places.
[SPEAKER_12]: You get bored of staring at the guitar
player's back all day because the guitar
[SPEAKER_12]: player's asses are all to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I looked up and I see this light coming
from the attic and I'm like, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_12]: that's a high intensity discharge light.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got an HPS light up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're growing some fucking weed up
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just like the crawl speed.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a space in the garage,
a little storage area.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I waited for everybody to leave except
for the dude that owns the place.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was his space.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I go, hey bro, not to be an asshole,
but I got hit in the face with the grow
[SPEAKER_12]: light a couple of times up there.
[SPEAKER_12]: What you got up there?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he kind of looked at me like,
huh, we'd smoke together.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd drink together.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're bros.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he goes, what do you know about a grow?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, I'm, I'm okay in a grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never been like in charge of a grow,
but I've been a helper plenty of times,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, well then come up here,
help me out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, I got a problem and need
help doing this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to be out of town for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you take over?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he goes out of town and he ended up
getting in trouble and he was gone for
[SPEAKER_12]: several days, way more days than expected.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I kind of took care of that crop.
[SPEAKER_12]: Harvest time came and I was there through
the whole harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: I helped the dude pull down the plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: I helped him trim.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got paid pretty decently for helping him
trim some weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this was in Kansas, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I got paid a little extra because we
were really running a risk being in
[SPEAKER_12]: Kansas.
[SPEAKER_12]: The laws, it was still completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were growing in basically a jam
space where we had a band practice set up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we were begging for attention every day
with plants just right above my head.
[SPEAKER_12]: I could reach up and touch the ceiling
where these plants were sitting on
[SPEAKER_12]: actually, which would be the floor on the
opposite side.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I got to finish that crop with my buddy
in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually brought some of that that we
grew.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I got paid with, I brought that back
to Colorado and shared that with a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: my friends here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my friends are like, dude,
you guys kind of killed it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were kind of impressed with my
herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had to move back to Colorado for some
family reasons.
[SPEAKER_12]: My grandparents were passing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I came to spend the kind of final days
with them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was one of my good excuses to get away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lawrence, Kansas was fucking me up,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I became an alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_12]: I became a drug addict.
[SPEAKER_12]: I needed to get away from there and change
my life.
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, I have not drank since
Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not blaming it on Kansas.
[SPEAKER_12]: But once I left there, I was able to get
away from that lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel like I'm way more productive.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I moved back to Colorado and I get
a medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there's not a lot of weed on the
streets anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the weed that I can find isn't up to
the expectations that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not as available as I would like
it to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I get a medical marijuana card and I
told myself that when I got this medical
[SPEAKER_12]: marijuana card, I would quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that there's as much cannabis
available as I want, why do I need to
[SPEAKER_12]: drink, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So I go to a couple of dispensaries and
some of them were okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was when it was the wild,
wild west, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was way different.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I go to a couple of dispensaries and I
don't really see anything that impresses
[SPEAKER_12]: me, but I made friends all over the
industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then one day somebody told me,
hey, there's a new dispensary in your
[SPEAKER_12]: neighborhood, but it's kind of a private
deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they told me that you had to call this
number first and then they would tell you
[SPEAKER_12]: where to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you had to knock on the door at
the back of this building and they would
[SPEAKER_12]: let you in.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I get my card ready.
[SPEAKER_12]: I get my ID and I called the number and
the guy's like, sure, I'll be home in
[SPEAKER_12]: about a half hour.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my house.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just come knock on my door.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I knock on his door and he lets me in.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was an old health food store
downtown and it was a three story
[SPEAKER_12]: building.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have to walk up to the back stairs
to the third story and knock on the door.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this dude had an apartment up there
and he would ask for your ID and your
[SPEAKER_12]: medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he would have you sit on the couch and
then he would light up a joint and smoke
[SPEAKER_12]: with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then after you smoked about half the
joint, he would bring out a couple of
[SPEAKER_12]: different bags of weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember one of the first ones he showed
me was chocolate chunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he had AK 47 Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was another one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I remembered, but I remember the
chocolate chunk got my attention.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he comes and shows me, he shows you
these screens and then he only let me buy
[SPEAKER_12]: a quarter of the first time.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, no, I don't know you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: He checked my medical marijuana papers
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: He made a copy of my ID and my medical
marijuana card and sold me a quarter and
[SPEAKER_12]: told me that I could come back every day
if I wanted and we'd make friends and all
[SPEAKER_12]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was kind of grabbing herb for other
people.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would go get weed for the girl I was
dating at the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would grab weed from my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a DJ friend of mine who needed
weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was the only one that really knew
about this dispensary in my group.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would go there every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would gather all my friend's money.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd go to this dispensary and ring the
doorbell.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd call him up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd bring the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he'd let me in and we'd sit on
the couch, smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he'd sell me a couple of quarters.
[SPEAKER_12]: And every day I'd go, he'd sell me a
little bit more and a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then he'd be like, so what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be like, this is just for the people
on my block, the people that sit in my
[SPEAKER_12]: basement and smoke weed all day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Instead of them smoking all my weed,
I'm grabbing weed for everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one day I show up and I could tell that
he's overwhelmed with work.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was just completely slammed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I walk up the stairs and I could see that
he's been carrying shit up the stairs and
[SPEAKER_12]: it's all piled up by the door.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I could tell that he's getting ready
to transplant.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, you going to transplant
some plants, bro?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he goes, yeah, you ever done that
before?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, oh yeah, I've transplanted
a whole bunch of plants in my life.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I have at this point, I've been
growing for a little bit and I've helped
[SPEAKER_12]: with a couple other gardens.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course I got that little lesson
when I was a little kid from my grower
[SPEAKER_12]: neighbor in the apartment building.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was like, yeah, I can definitely help
you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he goes, I'll tell you what,
come back tomorrow, come back at like 10
[SPEAKER_12]: in the morning and we'll do all of this
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll show you the grow and everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I go back, of course I show up a few
minutes early and he's impressed by that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We smoke and get good and stoned.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he shows me the grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a bunch of lights.
[SPEAKER_12]: This was a third story building that they
had.
[SPEAKER_12]: His apartment was on the top story.
[SPEAKER_12]: The middle story was all the big grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so he shows me the grow and he's like,
we need to pot all of these pots into
[SPEAKER_12]: bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm like, cool, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it took me like, I don't know,
maybe seven hours to do all those.
[SPEAKER_12]: He watched me do a few and he's like,
shit, this guy knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he just went out and did his own
business and left me there to do those
[SPEAKER_12]: pots.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went up, back up the stairs and got him.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, hey bro, these are all done.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, cool, we will pay you at
the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause everybody gets paychecks at the end
of the week around here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have money then I just come back at
the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll give you some money or you can
have credit at the store.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause you shop here anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, I'm good on herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I've been buying a bunch of
weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll just come back at the end of the week
and get money.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, uh, so I would show up for the
next few days and I would go to buy my
[SPEAKER_12]: regular quarter or half ounce or whatever
I was getting for the crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would just bring cash for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then he would always have work for me
when I would show up, he'd be like,
[SPEAKER_12]: well, you transplanted those.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know how to cut clones?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, I know how to cut clones.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we go into the little room and we cut
like a hundred clones.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, write down how many hours
you worked on.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll pay you on Friday or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: So throughout the week, I work a few hours
and Friday comes along and he's like,
[SPEAKER_12]: how many hours do you think you worked?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, you probably owe me,
you know, a couple hundred bucks or
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever I came up with.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember the numbers now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, well, here, the boss sent
you this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he handed me a nice stack of cash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, that's way too much money,
bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he goes, well, we want you to come
work for us every week.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we want you here from like 10 to five
every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll pay you this much every week.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you just show up and do the work.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this dude was running the dispensary
out of his bedroom and I was running the
[SPEAKER_12]: grow on the second story.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he would have to go run errands.
[SPEAKER_12]: He would do deliveries also at this time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of, it might've been illegal
back in the day, but whatever that's
[SPEAKER_12]: already passed.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was going to do deliveries and he'd be
like, Hey bro, people are coming up to the
[SPEAKER_12]: store.
[SPEAKER_12]: Will you be able to help them out?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, I got this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so one night I'm helping.
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually had medical marijuana patients
that would show up.
[SPEAKER_12]: These people were really sick and we were
a real dispensary.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one night there was an elderly couple
came and I'll never forget them.
[SPEAKER_12]: This lady was actually sick.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we sat on the couch and as I was
having the conversation, the guy that was
[SPEAKER_12]: running the dispensary showed up and he
got to hear me explain the differences
[SPEAKER_12]: between indicas and sativas.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he let me, he got to hear me kind of
care give for this woman.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had built a relationship with her over a
few minutes and figured out what's wrong
[SPEAKER_12]: with her.
[SPEAKER_12]: What, why she's sick, how she likes to
consume cannabis, what she's consuming
[SPEAKER_12]: for, how it makes her feel.
[SPEAKER_12]: If indicas or sativas work better for her,
what the difference is between indicas and
[SPEAKER_12]: sativas.
[SPEAKER_12]: I spent 30 minutes talking with this lady
to make sure that I sold her the right
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis and to make her feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was her first time buying cannabis from
a store.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this dude that actually ran the place
walked in and saw me doing this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's like, bro, you were amazing at
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no business doing it after seeing
what you just did with that lady.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's like, you were kind of now the
budtender guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: There wasn't the word budtender.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think existed at that point.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's like, you were now the sales guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to be dealing with the
customers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, I've got this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would grow weed most of the day and
deal with the customers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I realized, I was like,
we've got a dispensary on the third story.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, why don't we have this down on
the first floor where everybody can access
[SPEAKER_12]: it?
[SPEAKER_12]: And they said that the city asked them not
to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, well, we've got all of the
proper licensing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Monday, when I come in, I'm going to move
this door down to the first floor.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, we went to the second story
first.
[SPEAKER_12]: We moved, we cleaned out an area and went
to the second story so that you could come
[SPEAKER_12]: into the first door on the bottom story
and it would be a little office area and
[SPEAKER_12]: we'd greet you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we'd take you up to the second
floor and sell you buds.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did that for a little while.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I just kept getting braver and
ballsier.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, you know, we got to move this
down to the first floor where the handicap
[SPEAKER_12]: people can come.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a medical marijuana dispensary.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we moved it to the first floor and the
owner was real excited about what I was
[SPEAKER_12]: doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, I love that you got balls.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, I love that you can help the
customers.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, I love the way you deal with
things.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know about cannabis, you can grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he gave me a full-time position.
[SPEAKER_12]: And eventually the guy that hired me ended
up moving on to open his own business.
[SPEAKER_12]: He wanted to open his own dispensary
because he was going to run it.
[SPEAKER_12]: He learned how to run it pretty much.
[SPEAKER_12]: He saw everything he needed to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: He had a dream of opening his own shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't want to work for my friend,
Tom.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Tom Sexton and Karen Garnett.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're the ones who gave me a shot other
than Richard under Richard.
[SPEAKER_12]: Richard is the one that kind of told them
to hire me, but then they trusted me with
[SPEAKER_12]: their shop and gave me a shot.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one day Richard left.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a whole nother story on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys know me, you know that story
there and I'm not ever going to tell that
[SPEAKER_12]: on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: But so Richard left one day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tom and Karen came over to try to run the
store.
[SPEAKER_12]: I pretty much had the store under control.
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew all of our customers by first
names.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a young lady by the name of Tree.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out Tree.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you ever listened to this
show, but I hope you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a beautiful young lady named Tree
who ran the front desk.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also for a short time, there was a
young lady named Chrisann.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you hear this Chrisann.
[SPEAKER_12]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really hope we get to hang out and
play some music sometime.
[SPEAKER_12]: I loved both of those ladies, but they
were kind of my door girl, my door lady,
[SPEAKER_12]: my greeters, my, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_12]: A receptionist kind of lady.
[SPEAKER_12]: They weren't mine.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were the, the shop's receptionist
kind of person.
[SPEAKER_12]: They would check people in.
[SPEAKER_12]: When they got there, they'd be like,
Hey, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see your marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll put you in line.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they'd send them back to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'd be like, Jeff, your patient Bill is
heading back.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they'd come back and see me.
[SPEAKER_12]: The owner that originally owned the place
would show up every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm kind of a systems guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I make like systems and procedures.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're running a dispensary,
you've got to have like procedures in the
[SPEAKER_12]: way that shit flows or shit doesn't flow
properly, just like any real business
[SPEAKER_12]: needs.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would set up procedures and systems
and nothing against my friend,
[SPEAKER_12]: Tom, who owned the place.
[SPEAKER_12]: But he's an old Southern boy from North
Carolina, and he doesn't believe in any
[SPEAKER_12]: sort of systems or order or putting things
here or doing things this way.
[SPEAKER_12]: He just wants to smoke a joint and let
things happen the way they do,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is beautiful, but it doesn't work
for business.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one day I had to get the balls and I
had to say, Hey, Tom, the best thing for
[SPEAKER_12]: your business right now would be for you
to go on the mountain and grow the weed
[SPEAKER_12]: that you grow and bring that weed back to
the dispensary and let me sell it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you get the hell out of here.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, you really think so?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, I love you, but you don't
know how to run a business, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're kind of a train wreck when it comes
to a retail establishment.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he took it very well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he handed me the keys and he said,
young man, you got yourself a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_12]: don't do me wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he left and he let me run that
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_12]: We ran that for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I met our friend, White Mike,
that comes on the podcast here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I met Mike there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hired Mike.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mike was the first person I ever hired.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time I ever hired anybody as an
employee, it was Mike.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hired Mike to work as a backup budtender
at Meadowmore Ministries Dispensary in
[SPEAKER_12]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how we met.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hired a few people.
[SPEAKER_12]: The shop got huge.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were the only shop in town.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were the most popular shop in this part
of Colorado for a little while.
[SPEAKER_12]: We hired a couple more employees.
[SPEAKER_12]: We hired several more employees.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had Jordan and Andrea as backup
budtenders and computer people and
[SPEAKER_12]: managers.
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, I'm kind of getting
sidetracked here talking about Meadowmore.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm reminiscing in my own head.
[SPEAKER_12]: One day, a city manager and a police
officer came in and handed us a cease and
[SPEAKER_12]: desist letter that said we could no longer
serve cannabis out of that location.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of the patients that were in the
store, we gave them most of the product
[SPEAKER_12]: that was on the shelf because we were now
closed.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was nothing we could do with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember I picked a jar of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mike picked a jar of chocolate chunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jordan picked a jar of what he liked and
Andrea picked a jar of what he liked.
[SPEAKER_12]: We took those jars.
[SPEAKER_12]: The boss was like, go get a jar.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care what happens to the product.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're closed.
[SPEAKER_12]: It can have the shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the owner gave us the product.
[SPEAKER_12]: We gave most of the edibles and all that
perishable stuff to all the people that
[SPEAKER_12]: were there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when the cop came in, a bunch of people
just left.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they got out of there.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the people that stuck around,
they got a lot of free products.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just gave all that shit away.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Meadowmore was officially closed.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the end of that era, I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was my jumpstart into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take a quick drink of this
frosty cold Dr. Pepper and I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_11]: the rest.
[SPEAKER_11]: While I'm drinking Dr. Pepper,
I want to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_11]: buddy, John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_11]: Much respect, much love.
[SPEAKER_11]: John Hunt is trying to quit drinking Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why somebody would want to do
such a thing to themselves.
All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm back.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Meadowmore ends up closing,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody in this town knew who I was from
Meadowmore.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody knew that I was in the weed
game, that I was growing weed,
[SPEAKER_12]: that I had all the weed available.
[SPEAKER_12]: So everybody started calling my phone.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're like, hey, the store is closed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where can we get some herb?
[SPEAKER_12]: I had what's called a caregiver grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole time I was working at
Meadowmore, I was acting as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a personal home grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was completely legal and compliant with
the state of Colorado because I was a
[SPEAKER_12]: private registered caregiver for five
other medical marijuana patients and
[SPEAKER_12]: myself, which meant that I was allowed to
grow plants for myself and them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was growing product for myself and my
patients, but a lot of these people were
[SPEAKER_12]: trying to get it from me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there were a select few that honestly,
I sold the shit out of some weed to those
[SPEAKER_12]: guys, but I don't do that anymore so I can
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I really ended up doing was I was
caregiving and I was consulting and
[SPEAKER_12]: teaching people how to be a better
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would go, if you didn't know how to
grow weed yet, I'd go to your house and
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd help you set up your grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd figure out how much herb you need to
grow, how much space you've got.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd set you up and then I would either
get a fee upfront or I would get a portion
[SPEAKER_12]: of your harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of how I stayed afloat
there and kept myself real popular into
[SPEAKER_12]: this cannabis industry around here and
caregiving.
[SPEAKER_12]: As soon as I saw Meadowmore start,
I'd been breeding seeds and crossing
[SPEAKER_12]: plants a little bit before now,
before this time.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when Meadowmore went down,
I realized that I needed something solid
[SPEAKER_12]: because the consulting thing was great,
but it's unreliable.
[SPEAKER_12]: People around here, they say they're going
to pay and a lot of times they kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: don't want to pay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I started breeding seeds for retail
distribution and that's how iRegenetics
[SPEAKER_12]: came up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was posting pictures online.
[SPEAKER_12]: People were loving my cannabis pictures.
[SPEAKER_12]: I decided to make an iRegenetics Facebook
page and then iRegenetics really exploded.
[SPEAKER_12]: I began vending my seeds to a vendor known
as naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're now known as thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: They might have a little bit of my
products available right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, if you check them out,
thedankteam.com, you may be able to get
[SPEAKER_12]: some iRegenetics seeds from there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I started putting my seeds out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to a few cannabis cups and hustled
millions of seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got millions of seeds out on the
planet now that are my fault that I've
[SPEAKER_12]: given away and or sold.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was noticing that I was getting a
little stagnant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, I had the podcast after the seed
company got going.
[SPEAKER_12]: I started doing a podcast with my friend
Wade.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a podcast called 719 the blocks.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is now defunct, but he was doing a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: One night I went to a comedy show and he
wanted to do a podcast after the comedy
[SPEAKER_12]: show and he didn't have anywhere to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got this sweet table and I was like,
let's go to my house and record.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did a podcast with Wade and I
honestly fell in love with podcasting
[SPEAKER_12]: because of that, but I did not like the
equipment that Wade had and I didn't
[SPEAKER_12]: approve of the quality production that
Wade was doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I kind of volunteered to help Wade
get his show up to par and I bought some
[SPEAKER_12]: recording.
[SPEAKER_12]: I already had some equipment because I'm a
drummer and a musician, but I bought a
[SPEAKER_12]: couple other add-ons for my equipment,
bought an interface to make it work with
[SPEAKER_12]: my MacBook, started podcasting,
fell in love with podcasting with Wade.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a couple of episodes that featured
cannabis and then he got tired of hearing
[SPEAKER_12]: about weed on his show.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I made my own cannabis spin-off and
we're here now at 112 episodes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys for listening to me rant
this long and for listening to 112
[SPEAKER_12]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I started podcasting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then there were a bunch of dispensaries
opening up in my area and I was watching a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot of my friends in my age group get
really cool jobs at dispensaries and it
[SPEAKER_12]: just kind of looked like fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed the metamar days.
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed having coworkers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was working from home and private
facilities and I wasn't having the
[SPEAKER_12]: interactions with the social interactions
that I missed, that I desired.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my buddy Kevin, our old friend Kevin
that used to be on the show, he worked at
[SPEAKER_12]: the spot dispensary and he kept putting in
good words for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And saying that they should hit me up and
have me be their grower because they were
[SPEAKER_12]: having issues with their master grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I kept putting that off and putting
that off.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I decided I started dating a girl
named Angela and Angela got a job at the
[SPEAKER_12]: spot and talked about how much fun it was.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they would have functions.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_12]: Afro man came out to the spot and we got
to meet Afro man.
[SPEAKER_12]: They did a few other things that I went to
as a guest with Angela and I hung out and
[SPEAKER_12]: the spot crew was a bunch of fun people.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a good time with them.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all dirty minded dudes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had a really good time with Rob and
with Dave and with Vegas and with the
[SPEAKER_12]: whole crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really got along with everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one day Angela said, hey, they want you
to come in and talk about a job.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I walked into the spot dispensary and
they're like, who are you?
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, I'm Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the owner of iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been growing for this long.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been breeding for this long.
[SPEAKER_12]: I helped found the only dispensary in the
city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got a podcast with this many listeners.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had at the time an Instagram following
of like 15,000 followers, which has been
[SPEAKER_12]: deleted.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just threw down who I was and what I
did.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they looked me straight in the face
and they said, can you grow hydro?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I told them, I have very, very little
hydro experience, but I'm pretty sure I
[SPEAKER_12]: can learn it because it's a cannabis plant
and I can learn anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they looked at each other like they
were impressed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they shook my hand and they said,
how much money do you want to make?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I told them and they said,
okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I kicked myself in the ass because I
should have shot a lot higher since they
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't budget all.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, okay, we'll pay you
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's how I got into the spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: I basically, they knew who I was from my
buddy, Kevin, hyping them up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Angela told me that they were
talking to her and that I should go in
[SPEAKER_12]: there and hit them up for a job.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I went in there and they gave me a job
on the spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shout out to Kevin, shout out to Angela
and shout out to the whole spot crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though I'm not there anymore,
I have no ill will toward the spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not my spot for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't have any plants and I need to
grow plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that puts me into the next phase of how
I got into the industry or where I am now
[SPEAKER_12]: in the industry, I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: I worked at the spot for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were having issues getting their grow
rooms up and running and up to par.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was struggling to find something to
keep myself busy with for 40 hours.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was on salary.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was expected to be doing something.
[SPEAKER_12]: I caught myself cleaning dog shit in the
parking lot one time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought about it and I was like,
not to be conceited, but I was like,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a master grower and I'm pretty sure I
make one of the top salaries in the
[SPEAKER_12]: building.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why am I out here picking up dog shit and
not growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_12]: And that really started to like eat at me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, I'm doing things like sweeping
up dead bugs and fixing hanging shelves in
[SPEAKER_12]: the bud room.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, I'm not here to be fucking
Felix fix it or fix it Felix from record
[SPEAKER_12]: Ralph, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not my duty.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one day I was at work and our good
friend hunt from green and healthy
[SPEAKER_12]: wellness sent me a text message and it
said, give me a call as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_12]: And hunt doesn't really send out the SOS
like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually it's like, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's take dabs and you're free.
[SPEAKER_12]: But he said, as soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_12]: So since I wasn't doing a damn thing at
the spot, anyway, I pulled out my phone.
[SPEAKER_12]: I gave him a call.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, what's up brother?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was like, Hey, there was an issue
with my grower here and he no longer is
[SPEAKER_12]: employed and I need a master grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, he actually was calling to
ask if I had a partner or a minion that
[SPEAKER_12]: worked in my grows that I would donate to
him so that he could have somebody to work
[SPEAKER_12]: his grows.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, you know what, hunt,
I want that job.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we agreed on a wage and a starting
date.
[SPEAKER_12]: And about six weeks ago, it feels like I
took over as the lead cultivator at green
[SPEAKER_12]: and healthy wellness in Colorado Springs,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, right now the retail store,
you know, by the time this episode comes
[SPEAKER_12]: out, we'll be just a few days away from
the retail location opening.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, the new location is on four 30 West
Colorado Avenue in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the old gas station.
[SPEAKER_12]: We call it the Terp station.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we've got some art in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, we had a professional artist come and
do some beautiful art on the inside.
[SPEAKER_12]: The building is looking really great.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of parking.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, we will have a bunch of great art and
I'm really excited about it.
We're going to do a lot of art art in the
future.
I've got some art here.
Let's go ahead and get started.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to start with the green and
healthy wellness product.
[SPEAKER_12]: A round of February 1st.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will be harvesting the first round of
green and healthy wellness medicine grown
[SPEAKER_12]: by myself, Rasta Jeff put this into flour.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been taken good care of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'll be ready pretty soon,
but that's where I am now in the industry,
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty much how I got in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: that's where I am today in the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I still breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: My next breeding project will probably be
making an F2 version of the strain Arise.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will also add about four or five other
females into that selection.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there will be some Arise F2s and then a
couple of Arise crosses that come out of
[SPEAKER_12]: iREGENetics in the near future.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do intend to keep this podcast going as
long as people will listen.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know lately it's been a little bit
unprepared, but that's because I'm working
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of hours at Grain and Healthy
Wellness getting things put together
[SPEAKER_12]: there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm definitely adjusting to my new
schedule.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting everything back in order.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the shows are going to get back to what
they used to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: I said that after episode 100,
we'd get back into the grow lessons and
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been doing it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this episode and the one next week are
just going to be me ranting about stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think next week I'm going to talk a
little bit about what I do in the grow
[SPEAKER_12]: room.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to kind of take you guys to
the grow room with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll walk into the grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll talk about my chores that I do,
the things that I check.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll talk about my personal grow and a
small home grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll talk about the large scale grow at
Grain and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll try to talk about both of those.
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to do a checklist of things
that you guys should be doing on a daily,
[SPEAKER_12]: weekly, and monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So those will probably be the next two
episodes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I feel like I'm rambling on and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll keep this podcast going is what I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to keep breeding seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: iREGENetics will continue to come out with
new seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will keep breeding my new stuff to my
old stuff, plus the newest crosses that I
[SPEAKER_12]: find that I really like will be bred into
my lines.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to keep that going.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will keep the podcast going.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be at the Cannabis Cup for most of
the days.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys are coming to the Denver
Cannabis Cup over the 420 weekend,
[SPEAKER_12]: I will try to be there Saturday and
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course I will do my best to make an
appearance for 420.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cannot promise you anything with the way
the Grain and Healthy Wellness Garden
[SPEAKER_12]: goes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a lot of work for myself,
but I love every single minute of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Guys, there will be some collaborations
coming up in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be breeding some strains with some
other well-known breeders.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be also creating strains for some
people who I can't even talk about right
[SPEAKER_12]: now.
[SPEAKER_12]: People that you know their names.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might listen to their music.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might watch their videos.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are things that you might do that we
can't even talk about right now,
[SPEAKER_12]: but there's some cool shit coming up in
the future.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you guys, I feel like I've rambled for
a good 45 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just looked at the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to be a long episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate everybody for listening to
it.

[SPEAKER_12]: We're either going to do the checklist
episode or we're going to walk through my
[SPEAKER_12]: Ganja Garden and talk about my chores.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we'll combine that into one line.

[SPEAKER_12]: Your source for cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_12]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_12]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_12]: for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_12]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_12]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_12]: Roots band for letting me use their music

[SPEAKER_12]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy new year, everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope you guys had a great new year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope you've made some new year's goals.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you haven't made some goals for the new
year, you should grab a pen and a paper
[SPEAKER_12]: and you should just write down a few
things that you want to accomplish in
[SPEAKER_12]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you get that feeling of
accomplishment, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_12]: accomplish bigger goals.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just write down some goals and get that
shit done, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: And also if you had some bullshit in 2015,
now is the time to shake it off and leave
[SPEAKER_12]: it all behind.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you haven't forgotten about the
bullshit of 2015, it's time to take a big
[SPEAKER_12]: old fat dab, smoke a big old fat joint,
smoke a fat blunt, hit the vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_12]: however you do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to take a big old fat dab and
we're going to blow out all the bullshit
[SPEAKER_12]: of 2015.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to start fresh here in 2016.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to do that out of my brand
new Hitman short stack.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to the Hitman crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys know me.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I buy a rig, I like to buy an
American rig, something made in America.
[SPEAKER_12]: Buy an American.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I buy Hitman glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hitman glass is made by dabbers.
[SPEAKER_12]: These kids dab as hard as you and I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hitman Dougie is a dab enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a supporter of the hash movement.
[SPEAKER_12]: He throws a festival every summer in
California called the Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, I'm going to hit my brand new
Hitman short stack.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think there are words to describe
this rig other than fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've got the e-nail hooked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a big old glob of cactus cooler
from Turpex on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys take a dab with me and then we
will get on the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's inhale some positivity and love and
freshness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when we exhale, we're going to
exhale all the bullshit from 2015.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's take this dab together, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that was ... All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now this will be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shout out to the Hitman Glass crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys make sure you follow Hitman
Glass.

[SPEAKER_12]: Also make sure you follow Dougie on
Instagram.

[SPEAKER_12]: Made by guys who dab just as hard as you.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to turn down this music.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll get on with the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, I also want to make a huge
announcement.

[SPEAKER_12]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Drop in and give us a visit.
[SPEAKER_12]: What else do we have for business?
[SPEAKER_12]: The sticker packs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember a few episodes ago, we did a
hashtag and everybody who messaged us on
[SPEAKER_12]: Twitter and used that hashtag,
they're going to get a sticker pack.
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple of nights ago, Mike and I sat
here and addressed envelopes and I will be
[SPEAKER_12]: stuffing stickers into those envelopes and
they will go out Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when this podcast drops, those stickers
will be in the mail Monday, the same day.
[SPEAKER_12]: So by the time you hear this, the stickers
are on the way to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've only got, let's see, how many do I
have here that are addressed?
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got one, I've got two, and the third
person already got there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've only got two.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you were involved in that and you
need to send me your address, send me your
[SPEAKER_12]: address to growfromyourheartathotmail.com
and remind me that you deserve stickers
[SPEAKER_12]: from the hashtag I like it when you ramble
sticker giveaway.
[SPEAKER_12]: Remind me, I'll get you your stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: What else do we got in?
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to give a big shout out to my
buddy, Frosty.
[SPEAKER_12]: I bumped into my friend Frosty at the
Canyon Canyon Dab Club the other day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Frosty, I smoked that Kush bud that you
gave me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit dude, I was high.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I smoked that this morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the first thing I smoked.
[SPEAKER_12]: It made my eyes a little droopy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It made me want to be nice and lazy for
the day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always wonderful to receive the gift
of cannabis from friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's super great when your friends tell
you that they listened to your podcast and
[SPEAKER_12]: learned how to improve their cannabis from
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they give you buds that they
grew.
[SPEAKER_12]: So a shout out to Frosty.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's super good weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You did a good job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well flushed, well cured and superbly
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like your work.
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, I got to give a shout out to
everybody at the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_12]: I dropped into the Canyon Canyon and
everybody there is super kind,
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I walk in, everybody's like dab this,
dab this, try this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried some live resin.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried some butter, tried some shatter,
smoked a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had some solventless, had some full
melt, had a little bit of everything the
[SPEAKER_12]: last time I was there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really appreciate the way they treat me
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And shout out to all my friends at the
Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Camille.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be doing an episode from there really
soon that features our friend Frosty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Foxdrax.
[SPEAKER_12]: So keep your ears open for that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's get to the point of the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been telling you that I was going to
make a checklist of things that you should
[SPEAKER_12]: be taking care of in your garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did that for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a list of things you should do
daily, weekly, monthly, things you should
[SPEAKER_12]: do after each harvest, and also things
that you should do yearly.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a couple of things on that list.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think I'm going to take a dab and a
drink while you guys listen to a couple of
[SPEAKER_12]: seconds of reggae music.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will be right back and we will get
into this checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say here comes trouble,
here comes the danger, sent by the savior,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome the rasta youths.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not free oxy zoo, a degenerate
issue with no warning.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, you guys, I am back and I am
ready to get into this checklist.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you guys are taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: While I was taking dabs, I just hit some
cactus cooler from Turbex.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've ever cracked open a can,
any cactus cooler and taken a drink,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's exactly what this hash tastes like.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of got my mouth watering.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you ever taken a dab that made your
mouth water?
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually your mouth goes dry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me for coughing into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was listening to a podcast today and the
cohost was just coughing into the
[SPEAKER_12]: microphone or I really wanted to turn off
the damn show.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I apologize for coughing into the mic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, this checklist, here we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is stuff that I feel you should be
doing every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of this stuff will vary.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a hydro garden, some of this
stuff will be different.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a soil garden, some of this
stuff will be different.
[SPEAKER_12]: Based on the size of your garden,
some of this stuff will have to be done
[SPEAKER_12]: over a course of a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of this stuff will have to be,
if you've got a little garden,
[SPEAKER_12]: this stuff is just things that'll take you
two seconds.
[SPEAKER_12]: So here is what I've got for your daily
checklist.
[SPEAKER_12]: Daily, visually check each plant for bugs,
molds or signs of deficiencies or
[SPEAKER_12]: over-fertilization and correct if
necessary.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to get in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I walk in and I just pick a random plant
and I just pull a random leaf off of a
[SPEAKER_12]: random plant and I flip it upside down and
I look at it and I make sure there's no
[SPEAKER_12]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel the leaf.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can tell by feeling the leaf how healthy
the plant is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can kind of rub on the leaf and tell,
but I like to pull a leaf off,
[SPEAKER_12]: look for bugs, look for molds,
look around the room, see if any of the
[SPEAKER_12]: leaves are yellow or crispy or crunchy or
if anything's happening.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got anything weird going in
there, work on correcting it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Something I should add, anything that can
be done today, do it today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't wait until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got plenty of shit to do tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever you can do today, do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you just keep adding shit up for
tomorrow and then tomorrow never comes and
[SPEAKER_12]: then one of these days you're going to
have a big ass list of shit that you never
[SPEAKER_12]: did and you're going to find problems in
your grow and you're going to know why.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's because you didn't do that list of
shit that you should have been keeping up
[SPEAKER_12]: on.
[SPEAKER_12]: So try to stay on top of your chores,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: So check your plants every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should be touching every single plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should be putting your eyes on every
single plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get in there and love them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the second thing on my list here,
check to see if the plants need water.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can check visually.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can see if the plants look drier.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're droopy at all, if they're
starting to lean over, if the leaves are
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of hanging down, they need water.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or lift up the pot and check the weight.
[SPEAKER_12]: The standard way to do this is think about
it this way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Water your plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Water until it's full, freshly watered.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pick it up and see how much it weighs.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's its full weight.
[SPEAKER_12]: When it weighs half of that, it's ready to
be watered again.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to pour in water and get it wet
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: So second thing, check to see if the
plants need water.
[SPEAKER_12]: The third thing I would do every single
day, pull any dead leaves and put them in
[SPEAKER_12]: a trash bag or a trash can that gets
removed from the garden area.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like to leave my trash bag or my
trash can in the garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the reasons being, I apologize for
all the coughing and clinging over the
[SPEAKER_12]: throat.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll end here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Took a couple of fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason I like to get yellowing leaves
out of the room is bugs are attracted to
[SPEAKER_12]: yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bugs see yellow leaves as a perfect
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_12]: The outer layer of the leaf has been
softened and they can bite in and get to
[SPEAKER_12]: the juicy insides of the leaves a little
more easily.
[SPEAKER_12]: And bugs know that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're attracted to yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why your sticky traps are yellow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So get all the yellow leaves out of there,
put them in a trash can, put them in a
[SPEAKER_12]: trash bag and get them out of the room
because those are going to attract bugs.
[SPEAKER_12]: So get that shit away from there.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next thing I would recommend,
check the clones in the domes for
[SPEAKER_12]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_12]: Check the humidity levels in your clones
and check for roots.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you've got roots, transplant them,
put them into the next, if they're going
[SPEAKER_12]: into the next size rock wall, put them
into there.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're going into cups with soil,
throw them into there.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they've got roots, do whatever you need
to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they need moisture or humidity,
adjust that shape.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get in there and fix it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can fix the clone domes really easily.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the next thing to do, check the temps
and the humidity of the room and adjust
[SPEAKER_12]: that if necessary.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys try to aim for 40 to 60% humidity
during your bloom phase.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then during the veg phase,
you can be around 60 to 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't go any higher than 70% humidity
and try to have some airflow along with
[SPEAKER_12]: that, or you will get some issues.
[SPEAKER_12]: Try to keep the daytime temperature around
70 to 77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really like 74 degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: Plants really like 72 degrees.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the sativas like to get up to 77
during the day cycle.
[SPEAKER_12]: During the night cycle, try to stay within
10 degrees of what your day cycle is.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if during the day you're getting 77,
at night you want to be at 67 or a little
[SPEAKER_12]: higher.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't go more than 10 degrees swing from
day to night.
[SPEAKER_12]: So during the day, 70 to 77.
[SPEAKER_12]: During the night, 60 to 65 degrees during
your night cycle is what I try to aim for.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another thing that you need to do that a
lot of people forget to do, and I can tell
[SPEAKER_12]: by your Instagram photos, sweep the damn
floor.
[SPEAKER_12]: All you got to do is get a broom and a
dust pan and a bucket and sweep the floor,
[SPEAKER_12]: scoop up that shit that you just swept up
into a dust pan, dump it into the bucket,
[SPEAKER_12]: get it out of there and put it into a
trash can and get it out of the house.
[SPEAKER_12]: All that shit on the floor, first of all,
it looks terrible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you want that shit on your floor in
your grow room?
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the leaves off there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the dirt off there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get that, I can't think of what that
shit's called right now, that white stuff
[SPEAKER_12]: that sucks to step on, the perlite.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the perlite up off the floor.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just sweep up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every leaf on the floor, every little
piece of debris, that's a good spot for a
[SPEAKER_12]: bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a problem with white flies,
fungus gnats, spider mites, aphids,
[SPEAKER_12]: thrips, that's another spot for a bug to
hide.
[SPEAKER_12]: One little tiny bug can hide under a leaf
and lay so many eggs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't give them the opportunity,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fight the battle at your advantage.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't give these bugs a place to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: So sweep the floor.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next thing I would do, check any
equipment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Check your hydro pumps, check the easy
cloner pumps, check your dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're running hydro, check your mix
pump in your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a lot of guys have a big rez filled
with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just put a pump in there to shoot the
nutrients around.
[SPEAKER_12]: Check that pump.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure it hasn't gotten clogged up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those pumps have little filters on them.
[SPEAKER_12]: They like to get gunky.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're using any kind of feed system,
check that thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure your sprinklers haven't gotten
clogged up.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got an easy cloner, check the
water level in that as well and refill it
[SPEAKER_12]: and adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the next thing you should do,
check the pH and PPM levels if you're
[SPEAKER_12]: running any hydro.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a flood and drain kit,
if you're doing buckets or whatever,
[SPEAKER_12]: check your pH.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also check your PPM.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to adjust your pH.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to adjust your PPMs almost every
day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen large hydro gardens need to be
topped off every day if not twice a day
[SPEAKER_12]: because of water evaporation and plant
productivity.
[SPEAKER_12]: And every time that water evaporates and
you add more water, you've got to adjust
[SPEAKER_12]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_12]: So check that shit out all the time,
every day if you can, twice a day if you
[SPEAKER_12]: can on that if you're running hydro.
[SPEAKER_12]: You hydro guys may have a little bit more
work to do than us soil guys, but we've
[SPEAKER_12]: got a lot of soil and dirt to deal with.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the work will kind of math out,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't run a real hydro garden myself,
so I can't speak correctly on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it seems like you have a lot of
cleaning and a lot of maintenance to do on
[SPEAKER_12]: a hydro grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_12]: Prune and train the plants and shape them
the way you want them for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something you can be working on
every single day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind how you want those plants to
be shaped.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the architecture correct so that you
have sturdy plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: Try to use up as much canopy space as you
can with each plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So prune and train your plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take off all the shitty leaves.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take off any little sucker leaves that are
happening.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just get rid of that crap.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make the plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the next step, lollipop, any small crap
while you're in flower, all those little
[SPEAKER_12]: tiny buds that are happening on the
bottom, just cut that crap off.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can lollipop all the way up through
week four.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've done it up into week five.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once you get the hang of it, you can
really get carried away.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll know what to cut off.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll know what to leave.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you're new at it, only do it for
the first couple of weeks, I guess.
[SPEAKER_12]: Until you get the hang of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then once you've gotten a few crops
under your belt that you've lollipop,
[SPEAKER_12]: you'll be able to do it up into week four
or five without pissing the plants off.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've done it too late and caused
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I warn you to go light and then
learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So lollipop stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take off all that small crap in flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pull off any funky leaves while you're
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the next thing that you can do every
single day, you guys, take notes on
[SPEAKER_12]: everything you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything you do, just write down what
you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I run a large grow for green and healthy
wellness.
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, the owner of green and healthy
wellness has put me in charge of the grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I say goes.
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't ask me any questions as long as
at the end of the harvest, there's our
[SPEAKER_12]: goal weight of quality flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody's going to fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to reach that goal.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the OCD person in me, the person that
likes to be accountable, I make notes of
[SPEAKER_12]: everything I do all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I open up my phone, we could read
exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not exactly probably, but I mean pretty
close to every step I did today from
[SPEAKER_12]: walking in and checking the clones,
walking the rows and checking each plant,
[SPEAKER_12]: fixing the sprinklers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I write down what I do every day just
to keep accountability and to keep myself
[SPEAKER_12]: reminded of what's been done so that if
something goes wrong, I can look back on
[SPEAKER_12]: that and go, oh, look, it was right here
when I mixed this stupid shit together,
[SPEAKER_12]: I messed up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, you guys, a good reason to take
notes.
[SPEAKER_12]: This industry is expanding rapidly and
we're going to have marijuana available in
[SPEAKER_12]: every state before too long.
[SPEAKER_12]: When states start legalizing cannabis and
it's time to hire professional growers,
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys, that took good notes of all your
grows, you guys are going to have a
[SPEAKER_12]: portfolio, basically an application or a
resume right there on paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can say, look, I took notes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That shows that you're organized.
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows that you're accountable.
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows that you're planning.
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows that you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows that you're serious.
[SPEAKER_12]: All the other guys are going to be able to
say, well, I grew this much weed in my
[SPEAKER_12]: mom's basement and they're not going to
have any pictures or any notes or anything
[SPEAKER_12]: like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you guys are taking notes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have the advantage there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So take notes on everything you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I talk about that a lot, but it's
something that I think is really serious
[SPEAKER_12]: in a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: What if you do something different this
time and it comes out perfect?
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to want to know what you did.
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way your dumb high ass is going
to remember is if you wrote it down
[SPEAKER_12]: because you're smoking too much good weed,
because you're growing too much good weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: So write shit down.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is my weekly or my daily to do
checklist.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm now going to move on to weekly.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is stuff that you should be
handling once a week.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to pick Mondays and just kick
Monday's ass.
[SPEAKER_12]: I get all the chores done on Monday.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then through the rest of the week,
you can just focus on the plants and
[SPEAKER_12]: keeping everything clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: And doing all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: So every Monday, this is what I would do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would start each week with a
well-planned feed in each room.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a clone area, if they've got
water in trays or in a cloner,
[SPEAKER_12]: dump that water out, put fresh water in
there, fresh nutrients, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_12]: using.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're using A and B in the cloner,
or if you're using rapid start,
[SPEAKER_12]: or if you're using clone X, whatever,
put fresh solution in your cloner,
[SPEAKER_12]: get it going fresh on Monday or whatever
day you choose to start.
[SPEAKER_12]: But once a week, clean that sucker out and
get it going fresh.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also water all of your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: Feed your veg plants with a strong
nutrient solution on Monday.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're little babies, maybe just some
A and B.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're getting a little bigger,
maybe throw a little liquid karma in
[SPEAKER_12]: there.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're getting even bigger,
maybe they want some potassium silicates
[SPEAKER_12]: and maybe some Cal Mag in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should definitely be feeding your veg
plants a little bit of root inoculate
[SPEAKER_12]: also.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get those roots going.
[SPEAKER_12]: So also feed your flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: A well-planned feed each week.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's time to flush, you need to start
flushing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's another good reason to take
notes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you know when to flush.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys need help planning your
feeding, I did an episode all about
[SPEAKER_12]: feeding your flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: So episode number 69 will give you a
weekly schedule of what to feed your
[SPEAKER_12]: plants while they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you want to check that out,
that may be useful for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So every week feed your plants,
a well-planned feed.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next thing I would do every week is
dust all of the fans.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those fans get dirty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just dust the backs of them off.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to take off the screen and
clean the blades every week, that would be
[SPEAKER_12]: super cool of you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your room would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: All of that dust is going to end up in
your dabs if you don't clean the fan.
[SPEAKER_12]: Think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next thing I would do, check the
timers for proper time and function.
[SPEAKER_12]: Be there when the lights come on a couple
of times a week.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you can't be there all the time
when the lights come on, but if you can,
[SPEAKER_12]: try to be there.
[SPEAKER_12]: If the lights come on at nine o'clock,
just be standing outside of the room like
[SPEAKER_12]: 8.57.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that when the lights click on,
you can hear it go click, and then you can
[SPEAKER_12]: open the door.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can make sure the timer is working.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then be there again when the lights go
off.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just check the timers for proper time
and proper function.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every week I would calibrate your meters.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a pH meter, you should have
one of those calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the four, the seven, and the 10
solution, and just calibrate that thing
[SPEAKER_12]: once a week.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're a small time grower and you have
a hydro store near you that you frequent,
[SPEAKER_12]: they will probably calibrate your pH meter
for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll be nice and do that as a courtesy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So calibrate your pH meter.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should also have a PP meter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Calibrate that as frequently as you can at
least once a week.
[SPEAKER_12]: That can make a huge difference in the
quality of your flowers.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're measuring something and your
meter is telling you that it's at seven,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's actually at five and you're
adjusting to get to six, five,
[SPEAKER_12]: you're actually going to be adjusting down
into the fours, and you're really going to
[SPEAKER_12]: cause problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: So calibrate your meters, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next thing I would do at least once a
week is check all your blowers and fans
[SPEAKER_12]: and make sure that they're not clogged or
restricted in any way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of the time this can be done
visually.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can look around the room and see that
there's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you have a fan that's not plugged
in, you can put your fingers in any
[SPEAKER_12]: blowers, unplug them and give them a long
time to quit spinning.
[SPEAKER_12]: They spin for a long time, and just the
natural force of those fans spinning on
[SPEAKER_12]: their own weight, that's enough to put a
nice cut on your finger.
[SPEAKER_12]: So watch your fucking fingers with those
blowers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've cut myself on a blower before.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sucks more than you would ever know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take it from me.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's blood, sweat, and tears in my
garden, and that's where the blood came
[SPEAKER_12]: from.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the next thing, guys, visually check
the duct work and make sure that
[SPEAKER_12]: everything is sealed up.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're blowing a lot of pressure through
these ducts where the ducting connects to
[SPEAKER_12]: the lights, where the ducting connects to
the blower, where the ducting runs out of
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever room you're using.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just make sure that all that stuff is
sealed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also clean your air stones.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're making any kind of teas or
running any hydro, or if you've got
[SPEAKER_12]: cloners with air stones, or if you've just
got water sitting there to get bubbled,
[SPEAKER_12]: to get the chlorine out, clean the air
stones, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those things get murky.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes you might just want to throw
them away and replace them.
[SPEAKER_12]: They are not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a few bucks, just go buy new
ones.
[SPEAKER_12]: The next thing, clean your dehumidifier or
humidifier filter.
[SPEAKER_12]: In Colorado, we probably don't even have a
dehumidifier in most rooms.
[SPEAKER_12]: We use a humidifier in some places,
but clean those filters.
[SPEAKER_12]: They get funky.
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit gets dirty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything that has water running through it
frequently needs to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll get gross.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just clean your shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're running hydro, clean out your
reservoir every week to 10 days and start
[SPEAKER_12]: with fresh water and fresh nutrients.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I keep saying, water that sits
around, that gets old, gets gross.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit's able to grow in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Things can colonize in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You want fresh stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're running easy cloners,
do the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: Flush out those easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_12]: I talked about that a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just dump it out, fill it with fresh
water, fresh nutrients, pH it,
[SPEAKER_12]: and get it going all over again.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your plants will love you for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to drink old funky water,
do you?
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't even leave your dog's bowl
sitting there for too long without putting
[SPEAKER_12]: fresh water in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't do that to your plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: Love your plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're family too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Something you're going to need to think
about weekly, you need to dispose of your
[SPEAKER_12]: grow room trash carefully.
[SPEAKER_12]: When the trash man comes, I would wait
until the morning and take the trash out
[SPEAKER_12]: when you know he's coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't leave that trash sitting out there
on the curb overnight.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's out there on the curb,
your trash is accessible to the public and
[SPEAKER_12]: it is legal for police officers,
neighborhood kids, hungry homeless people,
[SPEAKER_12]: curious neighbors, whoever, private
investigators.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody can walk up to your trash and look
through your shit and they can take it if
[SPEAKER_12]: they want.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those guys stole my trash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they can do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: They really can.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, if you don't know the movie I'm
talking about, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was kind of cheesy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your trash is fair game if it's out there
on the curb.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a whole bunch of leaves in
there and you live in a state that is not
[SPEAKER_12]: legal to produce cannabis, that could be
evidence of a crime right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dispose of your grow room trash very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're doing a large grow, take it to
the dump yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: The guys at the dump don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just take it to the dump, have it in big
trash bags, just go drop it off.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't care that you're dropping off
weed leaves.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those guys have their own business going
on.
[SPEAKER_12]: So dispose of your grow room trash
carefully.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another thing I would recommend doing
weekly, look around the grow room,
[SPEAKER_12]: look on the walls and the ceiling and the
floors and look for any mold or moisture.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got condensation happening
somewhere, figure out why that's
[SPEAKER_12]: happening.
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got any mold, I've seen blue
mold form on the walls in grow rooms,
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen little green mold form on the
walls in grow rooms, clean that shit up,
[SPEAKER_12]: get rid of it, use H2O2, use bleach,
use peroxide, use something strong.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to go organic, do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do your thing, but clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is unhealthy for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unhealthy for the plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: Figure out why it's happening and resolve
the issue to make it not happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once you've cleaned it, you've got to
figure out what caused it and stop it from
[SPEAKER_12]: happening, or it'll just come back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mold is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can clean mold.
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw somebody clean mold off of a wall.
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to say it was about the size of
a quarter, maybe a 50 cent piece.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she scrubbed the mold with bleach and
hot water.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she called me the next day and she's
like, come over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want you to see this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I walked into that mold and formed
into like a four by four square.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just grew that much in like 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you've got mold, figure out what's
causing it, clean the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You may need to call a professional
eventually.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't ruin our mental home, growing weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: God, I apologize for clearing the throat
so much in this episode, but I've got a
[SPEAKER_12]: whole bunch of good dabs from the turp
station.
[SPEAKER_12]: So a shout out to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can blame all the throat clearing on
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounded grosser than it was meant to,
but there we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's everything that you should do
and my opinion stuff that you should do
[SPEAKER_12]: weekly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to move on to things that you
should do monthly.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're running hydro or if you have a
feed system, I recommend that you clean
[SPEAKER_12]: the lines out some way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who recommended it to me?
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember who said it, Shane.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was our friend Shane.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shane recommended that you use an air
compressor to clean out the lines of your
[SPEAKER_12]: hydro system to blow out any clogs.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you've got a feed system,
you've got a hydro system, clean that shit
[SPEAKER_12]: out.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got little sprinklers,
clean those out.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got drippers, clean those out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might have to hand poke them.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might have to get something pokey and
just hand poke each little hole out by
[SPEAKER_12]: hand, but you need them clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: So clean the shit out of those.
[SPEAKER_12]: Monthly, clean your air conditioner
filters.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that needs to be done
monthly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also test your smoke detectors.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should have smoke detectors in your
grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you don't want that shit burning
down.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it catches on fire, you want to heads
up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So test your smoke detectors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Replace the battery if necessary.
[SPEAKER_12]: That should be obvious.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing like hearing beep,
beep all the time when you're growing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The damn battery is trying to die.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the worst sound ever.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how anyone can live with
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another thing you should do every month,
clean the glass in your reflectors,
[SPEAKER_12]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: This may need to be done more or less
often, depending on your style.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're spraying in there, if you're
using a foliar spray, that shit's going to
[SPEAKER_12]: probably end up a little bit on the
reflectors, unless you're careful.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're spraying bug sprays,
it's going to end up on the light
[SPEAKER_12]: reflectors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Clean that glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just clean it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can, slide the glass out,
clean the inside.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes your carbon filter blows a
little bit of carbon in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just clean that stuff up.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're paying for the light to shine.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's taking electricity.
[SPEAKER_12]: The light is shining.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't put a dirty lens between the light
and the plants that you're trying to put
[SPEAKER_12]: the light on.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just makes more sense to clean it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're paying full price no matter what
you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: So clean that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of paying full price,
the next step, these may sound like no
[SPEAKER_12]: brainers, but pay your electricity and
water bills every month, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should be okay running a whole bunch
of electricity and using a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_12]: water, but the first time you miss a bill,
they're going to come fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to knock on your door.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to want their money,
and that's when shit can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: So pay your bills.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't ever try to ditch out on a grow
bill.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't ever steal electricity.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't ever steal water.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just pay your bills.
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of the people that listen to this
show should already be doing that,
[SPEAKER_12]: but don't ever steal.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do get caught stealing electricity
or water, the government, I think here,
[SPEAKER_12]: I was told that they're able to charge you
threefold for what you use.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you use a hundred dollars on
electricity and you get caught stealing
[SPEAKER_12]: it, they can charge you $300.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because you stole it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So pay upfront.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my stuff you should do monthly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to move into things that you
should do every harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every harvest, you're going to need to
dispose of your sticks and leaves that you
[SPEAKER_12]: have left over.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's going to be a bunch of sticks and
a bunch of leaves and a bunch of trim.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not the small trim.
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to make cash out of that,
but like a bunch of trim crap that you
[SPEAKER_12]: don't want laying around.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, don't go throwing that in the
trash and just leaving it out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might want to wait for the trash guy
to come.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might want to find a friend who has a
construction site and get permission to
[SPEAKER_12]: throw your trash in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't go using someone's dumpster because
if you get caught doing that, that's a
[SPEAKER_12]: fine for throwing your trash into somebody
else's shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they'll want to see what you
threw in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then this cops looking at you and your
big ass bag of weed leaves.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you're trying to figure out a
story.
[SPEAKER_12]: So figure out a clever way, a safe way,
a smart way to get rid of all your sticks
[SPEAKER_12]: and leaves.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also dispose of or compost or recycle all
of your soil carefully.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to be in the backyard
dumping out your old pots.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then your backyard ends up full of
perlite and it's all white and speckly and
[SPEAKER_12]: the dirt doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to figure out a way to either
dispose of or recycle all of that soil
[SPEAKER_12]: that you use.
[SPEAKER_12]: Recycling soil isn't as hard as you would
imagine.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just needs to be re-amended and kind of
stirred around.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you can definitely use that soil
again.
[SPEAKER_12]: So figure out a way to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've done a little bit of talking about
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still experimenting with it myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: So once I get good at it, I'll do a full
episode on recycling soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: I made a little note about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, you're going to have to learn how
to get rid of a bunch of dirt.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have sticks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're also, if you're running hydro,
you're going to have rock wool cubes or
[SPEAKER_12]: you're going to have those hydroton clay
pellets.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate those things.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have to get rid of that
shit too somehow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure you can recycle the rock
wool cubes, the hydroton pellets.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can rinse them off and use them again.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can clean them, but eventually you got
to throw those away because they get
[SPEAKER_12]: funky.
[SPEAKER_12]: So don't go throwing those into your
trash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure you get rid of those safely and
smartly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is smartly a word?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also clean your pots, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every harvest, you should clean your pots.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should also clean your hydro trays.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a four by four botanic care
tray or one of those four by eight trays,
[SPEAKER_12]: you should clean those things.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're going to think I'm crazy,
but here's how I recommend you do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Throw it in the truck and just take them
right to the car wash and just line the
[SPEAKER_12]: pots up against the wall and just spray
the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Colorado here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody knows what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just go spray your shit down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_12]: The hydro trays, lean it up against the
side of the truck, spray the shit out of
[SPEAKER_12]: it, throw it in the back of the truck,
take it home.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're in another state, that may be
kind of weird, but if cannabis is legal,
[SPEAKER_12]: just take them to the car wash and hose
them down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't use any soap.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't use the car washing soap.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't wax them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just use hot water on them with the high
pressure thing and just spray the shit out
[SPEAKER_12]: of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So once you got your pots cleaned,
I recommend you clean the room thoroughly
[SPEAKER_12]: from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_12]: I said earlier, use H2O2, use bleach,
use hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a thousand other products I
could say to use, but use something to get
[SPEAKER_12]: in there and sanitize the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't just clean it up, sanitize it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Our good friend Mike helps me out when
it's time to clean the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mike and I dress up in our little let's
get clean suits.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically just our shittiest clothes
we have.
[SPEAKER_12]: Put bandanas on our faces, put our hair in
crazy hats, go down in there and just
[SPEAKER_12]: clean everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the time we're done, you can eat
off the floor of my grow rooms when
[SPEAKER_12]: they're freshly started.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is so gorgeous in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Since I'm talking about Mike, I want to
give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_12]: We recorded a podcast last night and the
recording sounded like shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Something went wrong in the recording
software and everything sounded like
[SPEAKER_12]: robots.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounded like R2D2 and Darth Vader and B8
having conversations.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just deleted that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize to Mike for that podcast,
never making it to the air, but you know
[SPEAKER_12]: he'll be back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mike, you'll be back, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry that did not work, but you'll
get over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to come dab and hang out anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thanks for coming and let's get back
into the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sanitize your room, every harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, clean the floors and the walls and
the ceiling, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wipe them down, scrub them down.
[SPEAKER_12]: The ceiling gets funky.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's humid.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're in there spraying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're in there spraying foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that puts moisture everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then it gets humid.
[SPEAKER_12]: Water rises.
[SPEAKER_12]: The ceiling is going to get funkier than
you're going to assume.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just scrub it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll think it's clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll hit it with the rag and you'll
realize it is not clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: The walls, obviously, same thing with the
foliar spray, same thing with the
[SPEAKER_12]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the floors, everything lands on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've spilled nutrients there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been walking there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just filthy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Clean that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, inspect any seals you've made.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've sealed up any windows or doors
or anything like that, if you've put
[SPEAKER_12]: caulking somewhere, re-caulk it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've taped it, re-tape it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, if you've put up, I put up HEPA
filters.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I've got a wall between two rooms
and I'm pulling air from one room to the
[SPEAKER_12]: other, I just go to Lowe's and buy those
little square HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just cut them kind of close to the
shape I want and just staple them to the
[SPEAKER_12]: wall.
[SPEAKER_12]: I replace those.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every time, every harvest also,
I try to because they get dusty,
[SPEAKER_12]: they get dirty, but they keep all the funk
out of the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just go ahead and replace those.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just those little square HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can find them at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can't find those, just use any kind
of filter will work for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just better than having the hole
where the air is moving open.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just want to put a filter over there
to catch the dirt or any bugs or anything
[SPEAKER_12]: that may be trying to move around,
trying to migrate from place to place.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yearly, here are a couple of things
that I think you should do every single
[SPEAKER_12]: year as a grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I forgot to mention every harvest,
that little sleeve that goes around your
[SPEAKER_12]: carbon filter, take that off and clean it
and put it back on.
[SPEAKER_12]: And good luck not getting carbon
everywhere the next time you turn on your
[SPEAKER_12]: carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are tons of tricks on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you use a carbon filter, every time
you move it, you jar the carbon inside and
[SPEAKER_12]: then you put a blower on there and you
plug in the blower to start blowing the
[SPEAKER_12]: air through the filter just to use it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then all that carbon you've just
stirred goes flying through all of your
[SPEAKER_12]: lights and into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got to figure out a smart way to
catch that carbon.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I do is I blow it into a... I've got
a... What is it?
[SPEAKER_12]: I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't think of the brand.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Crown Royal bag because the Crown
Royal bag will let the air out,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it'll catch all of the particulate
that's coming through.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just put the ducting into a Crown
Royal bag and hold it and then plug it in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then it blows into there for a couple
seconds.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I just pull that off and seal it
up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've caught all the carbon in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a trick, one really weird random
trick to keep all of the carbon from
[SPEAKER_12]: blowing out when you've got a new carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_12]: So take that little cover off,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: It comes with a sleeve.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take that off, clean it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like shit when it's all dusty
anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: You want that white and clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Put some OxiClean in the water.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get that sucker white again.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yearly, here's where we are.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yearly, replace your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_12]: The guy at the hydro shop swears to me
that my carbon filters are going to last
[SPEAKER_12]: two years.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do not.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a guy replacing a... What's it
called?
[SPEAKER_12]: A transformer in my backyard a couple of
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he told me, sir, it smells like you
got a skunk back there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Check here.
[SPEAKER_12]: There were no skunks back there.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a little bit of grateful dog
crossed a space queen.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was sneaking up the whole
neighborhood because my carbon filter
[SPEAKER_12]: needed to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a new one sitting there now.
[SPEAKER_12]: As soon as I rebuild the room,
I'll have a fresh filter.
[SPEAKER_12]: The neighbors will quit smelling the candy
scented skunks.
[SPEAKER_12]: So replace your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_12]: They only last about a year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another thing that you should do every
year, you guys, have your fire
[SPEAKER_12]: extinguisher checked and replaced or
charged.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got a little red, yellow,
and green gauge on them.
[SPEAKER_12]: You want it all the way in the green.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it starts to get to yellow,
it's not reliable anymore and you need a
[SPEAKER_12]: new fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_12]: You either need to go get it charged or
just buy a new one.
[SPEAKER_12]: They sell them at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_12]: They sell them at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not expensive.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully, you never need it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really hope you never need it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you do, you want it fully charged.
[SPEAKER_12]: Always have a fire extinguisher near your
grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a veg room.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a flowering room.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a fire extinguisher hanging on the
outside of my flowering room.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have it on the outside.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you hear that smoke alarm and they're
going off, grab the fire extinguisher,
[SPEAKER_12]: check the door for heat.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's stupid hot, you have a decision to
make.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to open that door or not?
[SPEAKER_12]: Open that door, hit that fucker with the
fire extinguisher that you've already got
[SPEAKER_12]: in your hand.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to open the door and run in
there and find the fire extinguisher in
[SPEAKER_12]: the smoky, hot, fiery room.
[SPEAKER_12]: So have it on the outside.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really, I pray to Jah that you never
have to use your fire extinguisher,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I'd rather you have it and it work.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd rather you be safe than this thing
fail on you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've got another fire extinguisher
right just outside the veg room also.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just that's where shit can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a lot of lights, a lot of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just want to be a responsible grower,
try to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_12]: So get your fire extinguisher inspected
and replaced once a year.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's all I've got for the
checklist you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really want to thank all my friends on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_12]: I posted to Facebook asking for some
updates and a lot of people contributed.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many of you that I'm not even going to
try to list everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shout out to my Facebook community that
helped out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some things I did leave out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that things got left out
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll need to work on a pest management
system.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll need to integrate that into this
checklist somehow.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't see any issues, you can
simply spray once a week with an organic
[SPEAKER_12]: application, whatever you want to use.
[SPEAKER_12]: I use Azimax if there's no problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: Since I travel from so many gardens,
I hit my plants once a week with Azimax
[SPEAKER_12]: when they're in veg just to make sure that
I don't bring anything home from all the
[SPEAKER_12]: other gardens I play in.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you see any issues in your garden,
you may need to increase the frequency and
[SPEAKER_12]: the potency of whatever you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe change the active ingredient to
something a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully you don't get any pests if
you're doing something preventative,
[SPEAKER_12]: but that's something you'll have to work
into this regimen here as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also going to be a point in time
where you're going to need to change your
[SPEAKER_12]: light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did another episode on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every bulb is different.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every garden is different.
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about swapping out your thousand
watt HPS bulbs about every one to three
[SPEAKER_12]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard people using them for a full
year.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard people using them for a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like I said earlier, when your bulbs
start diminishing, your eyes won't notice
[SPEAKER_12]: it, but your plants will.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're still paying for all of the
electricity.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got a thousand watt bulb and
it's six months old, it's probably only
[SPEAKER_12]: putting out 60 to 70% of its output,
but you're paying for 100% of that
[SPEAKER_12]: thousand watts to be running.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go upgrade your bulbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't cost that much money.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you think about how much herb you're
going to grow from a fresh bulb,
[SPEAKER_12]: the difference, the cost of that bulb
should definitely be worth it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what I've got for you
[SPEAKER_12]: on this podcast, but I'd love to hear what
you think of this garden checklist.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get started.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I just confused the shit out of
your head, but I will post a picture of
[SPEAKER_12]: this to Instagram so that you can check it
out.
[SPEAKER_12]: A huge, huge shout out to my friends at
Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure you follow them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let them know that you heard about them
from the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: We would all appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, now that the show is over,
I would appreciate it if you go to the
[SPEAKER_12]: iTunes store, search for the Grow From
Your Heart podcast, find the review
[SPEAKER_12]: section, give me a five-star rating,
and after that, type in a comment and let
[SPEAKER_12]: me know what you think of the show,
and I will read your comments on a future
[SPEAKER_12]: episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I haven't done that in a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to save up a couple,
and once we've got enough there,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go and read three or four or five
comments, and we'll share that with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd appreciate it if you go and do
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: What that does is that it exposes the show
to more people.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll move us up in the rankings.
[SPEAKER_12]: More people will see the podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: More people will listen.
[SPEAKER_12]: More people will grow better cannabis,
and that's the main goal here,
[SPEAKER_12]: is just get more people to grow better
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you guys, don't forget that the show
is available on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Stitcher and every single episode is
always and forever archived on
[SPEAKER_12]: iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't forget about the donation button on
the website.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, on the top right, if you go to
iregeneticscolorado.com, click on the Grow
[SPEAKER_12]: From Your Heart Podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the top right, there is a donation
button.
[SPEAKER_12]: That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm never going to charge you for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: This podcast is always going to be free,
but if you'd like to make a contribution,
[SPEAKER_12]: I would truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're curious where your contribution
goes, it goes to paying for the hosting of
[SPEAKER_12]: my website.
[SPEAKER_12]: It goes for things like new microphone
covers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I try to have microphone covers for the
guests because they do this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_12]: They rub their faces all over the
microphones when they're talking because
[SPEAKER_12]: they're new.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I try to have a cover for each guest so
they don't have to go rub their faces.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rubbing their face on another person's mic
cover.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that that's gross.
[SPEAKER_12]: Water bottles for all of the guests,
but mostly it goes to covering the
[SPEAKER_12]: Bluehost hosting fee, which is where I
have my website, which is where I host
[SPEAKER_12]: this show.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's 113 episodes up there,
so it does take a little bit of bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I'm just letting you know where
that goes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like to contribute, I would
definitely, definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd give you a big shout out on the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Send you a couple of stickers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_12]: What else do I have for you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure you listen next week.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys will have Foxtracks on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's all I've got.
[SPEAKER_12]: Please follow me on Instagram,
irey underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna give a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks again for listening and until next
time, take a fat dab and give your mama a
[SPEAKER_12]: hug for me.

joint on it.

[SPEAKER_12]: Before I get that far, I want to give a
huge shout out to my friends at the Canna

[SPEAKER_12]: take some dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can smoke some flowers with us.

[SPEAKER_12]: The place is classy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will have Camille, the owner of the

[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, check it out,

[SPEAKER_12]: It's at 1507 West Colorado Avenue in
beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a sign out front that says the
Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be easy for you to find.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to fade out the music for a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be right back with our friend
Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fox.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_12]: We are here at the Canna Canyon in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me find the address.
[SPEAKER_12]: We are at 1507 West Colorado Avenue in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_12]: We are at a really cool place,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a place where adults 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got an ID and a few bucks at the

[SPEAKER_12]: and you can take dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are people from Colorado here that
are heads in the scene.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of Colorado's finest is here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Colorado Springs' finest is here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, we've got people here from Texas
hanging out, taking dabs, being beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are ladies here.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are dudes here.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are more ladies than men here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is pretty rare for a cannabis club.
[SPEAKER_12]: Big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: Leaving the club right now is my good
buddy, Jason Margulies.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great day, buddy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Be safe on the road.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's out of here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sitting to my right, I'm going to
introduce the man, the myth, the legend,
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fox.
[SPEAKER_12]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty good, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_14]: How about yourself, brother?
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I am great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited to have you here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited to be at a club.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love this place.
[SPEAKER_14]: This place has such a great vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's definitely one of the first spots I
go to when I come down to the Springs now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm actually here now, so you know,
it's one of the first places I go to.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to be doing shows from here a
lot, I feel like, because this place has a
[SPEAKER_12]: great vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Camille for inviting me here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to the whole staff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they treat me like a VIP when I show
up?
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard not to feel special when I come
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't turned a doorknob here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every time I show up, somebody opens a
door for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: They carry my goodies in for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the sweetest thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Big shout out to the club.
[SPEAKER_12]: So our friend Fox here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you mostly as Fox.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll probably call you Fox most of the
show.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are who I refer to as my CBD expert.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I've got a CBD question, I usually call
you up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess what I should start with is can
you tell my listeners a little bit about
[SPEAKER_12]: what CBD is?
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD, just like THC, is a compound
cannabinoid in cannabis that is
[SPEAKER_14]: non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's say THC is a psychoactive
compound, which obviously gives us a great
[SPEAKER_14]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that
has different qualities that THC doesn't
[SPEAKER_14]: have.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of 138 found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: 138 cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I only know of maybe 12 or 13.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, PhD was sitting down with me and
telling me all this and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_14]: go on, please.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get that PhD guy on here one day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bring him next time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So THC is the one that we all love.
[SPEAKER_13]: It gets us high.
[SPEAKER_13]: It gets us blazed.
[SPEAKER_13]: You said there's no psychoactive effects
to CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, there's more like a euphoric effect.
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, in high doses, you can get kind
of like an elevated euphoria, but it's
[SPEAKER_14]: nothing like a psychoactive effect where
you feel high per se.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've smoked a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: Being in Colorado, we're blessed to have
CBD available.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't smoke a lot of CBD myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't do anything for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a medical marijuana patient,
but I don't need the CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I try to save it for the patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did talk about it on one episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll talk a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_12]: About the effect that it had on myself and
a friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I want to hear more about,
so why are we going for the CBD?
[SPEAKER_12]: What does it really do for you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are you so enthusiastic about CBD if
it's not psychoactive?
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, my story with CBD is a little bit,
it's long, but- We've got plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the long-terms of it, when I was
young, you know, I'd lost a child to
[SPEAKER_14]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so- Your own child?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: I never knew that.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, yeah, it's fine, brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I'm here and that's why I raise
awareness.
[SPEAKER_14]: I lost my second child to epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was very young when it happened.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had no idea about epilepsy at the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Literally, it took me by storm.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a good seven-year period where I
had went to a very confused place.
[SPEAKER_14]: It put strain on every relationship around
me.
[SPEAKER_14]: All that I continued to focus on at the
time was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had no idea that it would bring me
round circle to something that I had dealt
[SPEAKER_14]: with and not really knew about what had
gone on until I met a parent going through
[SPEAKER_14]: something similar with their nonverbal
autistic child who was a cannabis patient
[SPEAKER_14]: in their state.
[SPEAKER_14]: They started telling me all about the
wonders of how CBD is working for them,
[SPEAKER_14]: but they have problems getting it,
problems obtaining it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The CBD that they were getting was tainted
and making their child sick.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's probably a question for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Terrible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we didn't know much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's say, this was two years ago that I
contacted other parents.
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't know what we know now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what is available now definitely
wasn't them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen you come a long way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen you- The hash that you brought
today is amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: How much of that did you make?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Only one of these, actually.
[SPEAKER_14]: The rest of them are from companies that I
love to support.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can shout them out if you feel like.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a little bit of a craft
concentrate as well as a viola live resin
[SPEAKER_14]: and some wonderful full malt extractions
from natural mystic caregivers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some blueberry, cherry CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to mix it up, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually if I run something, it's out of my
garden and it's first donated to the
[SPEAKER_14]: patient.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's very limited on the- Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very limited small batch drops that I
have.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I rather just, you know, I'm luckily in
a great place where a lot of our friends
[SPEAKER_14]: are in the community and the industry and
they're killing it at what they do.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm happy to support any of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the way you do things.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been watching you on- We should let
people know how they can follow you on
[SPEAKER_12]: social media.
[SPEAKER_12]: How can they find you on Instagram and
Facebook while they're listening?
[SPEAKER_14]: On Facebook, I am KabukiJFox.
[SPEAKER_14]: And on Instagram, I am at foxtrax,
F-O-X-T-R-A-T-C-S.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go check them out while we're talking to
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go make sure you stalk them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm coughing into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_12]: He gave me a big old fat dab of some
solvent a few minutes ago and I'm still
[SPEAKER_12]: sweating a little bit from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: Super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Off of a- We got to give a shout out to
Bear Mountain Glass for the gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_12]: What colors exactly are those?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is my Bear Mountain Studios custom
one-of-one rain drop and purple lollipop
[SPEAKER_14]: Kleinda.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a Klein, but it's kind of a Klein.
[SPEAKER_14]: So he calls it a Kleinda.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what I've kind of been calling
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_14]: I get a lot of compliments on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sort of got almost an egg sort of a
feel to it as well with the way that it's
[SPEAKER_12]: hollow there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost like a hollow honey jar of sorts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The opals really do kick it off.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys follow me on Instagram,
it's irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will post a picture that I took a nice
picture of you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure you can find it on Fox's
Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be sharing all those photos.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we'll take a pic of that and take a
pic of us together.
[SPEAKER_12]: So man, that's why you've got the passion.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I understand what put passion into
you.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why you came out of nowhere and
you're winning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, congrats on the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny that Jason, who was actually
here, it was my material that I grew.
[SPEAKER_14]: We ran it together on a wonderful unit
that he had, I think a sweet leaf or
[SPEAKER_14]: something.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Caleb over there got the oil and
cranked it out into the award-winning
[SPEAKER_14]: chocolate bar that it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of funny that he had all
those people in the room at the same time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of in a room full of rock stars
and beautiful ladies right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: This could not have gone any better.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: You should definitely give Caleb a little
shout out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shumit bars, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's definitely cool with the CBD work
he's doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to the Shumit bars.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a few left on the shelf down
there at the Cana Canyon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come by.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll tell you how you can get a hold of
those.
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Try the peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very yummy.
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite was the banana.
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_12]: A banana something you gave me?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was the entry, the banana cream
pie.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I walked around just slow for the rest
of the day.
[SPEAKER_12]: It put a little slowness on my day.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the oil that we used for it,
it came back testing out at 71.3% CBD,
[SPEAKER_14]: 10.95% THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: So a really strong 7 to 1.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we cranked out and did the math
and he dosed it out, it came out to like
[SPEAKER_14]: 160 milligrams to that bar.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, it was almost the perfect
ratio for just literally having the
[SPEAKER_14]: calmest day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was calm.
[SPEAKER_14]: We gave some and donated some to some
autistic patients that were having some
[SPEAKER_14]: rage issues, pediatric nonverbal.
[SPEAKER_14]: So obviously, you know, it's hard to gate
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the results that we were getting back
from the parents were almost immediate
[SPEAKER_14]: saying just from a few chips of this
chocolate bar, they were getting calming,
[SPEAKER_14]: soothing effects.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was really helping with those
serious anger conditions.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no way that I could be rageful or
angry after eating that thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just completely calm.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was walking around day two of the
cannabis cup just in shallow mode.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a kind of bubble around me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you said it really helped the autistic
children with their rage.
[SPEAKER_12]: What other things does CBD help with?
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to educate my listeners a little.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to get these guys up to speed.
[SPEAKER_14]: So CBD is a neuroprotectant, anti-cancer.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me pause for a second when I say
anti-cancer.
[SPEAKER_14]: We all know that THC kills cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD freezes the cancer cell in its tracks
so it can't progress or grow any further,
[SPEAKER_14]: but it will not kill it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So anti-cancer is freezing it at bay its
best.
[SPEAKER_14]: It basically causes cell death in the
mutated cells so that the tumors can't
[SPEAKER_14]: grow anymore, but they remain.
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll still exist if they're done.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you use a conjunction of a high CBD,
high THC regimen with cancer, you're bound
[SPEAKER_14]: to basically stop, freeze, and kill those
mutated cells and get back to a healthier
[SPEAKER_14]: way of living.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_14]: So CBD is a neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_14]: So obviously it's very popular with
epilepsy and other neurological diseases,
[SPEAKER_14]: Asperger's, autism, children on the
spectrum, Crohn's, PTSD, anxiety.
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of goes on.
[SPEAKER_13]: So almost anything that an adult would be
suffering from.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I take CBD for my headaches.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even take any form of aspirin or
any.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I have completely separated all
that with different regimens of CBD and
[SPEAKER_14]: THC and just a healthy cannabis regimen.
[SPEAKER_14]: Feeding that endocannabinoid system is
very important.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we all, as medical patients,
have our own deficiencies in those
[SPEAKER_14]: systems.
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD is one of those all around
protectants.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the multivitamin of the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to make a sticker out of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: The syndrome sticker of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: It does so much in different variations
and ratios.
[SPEAKER_14]: It can help so many different things.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cerebral palsy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nerve damage.
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it literally, in CBD itself,
there's other spectrum of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_14]: CBN, CBG, CBC, you know, that all have
different medical attributes that aren't
[SPEAKER_14]: psychoactive, get you high kind of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of these is an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of these is a antibacterial.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of these is a bone regenerant.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I make a CBG cream for a couple
of patients that have this rare disease
[SPEAKER_14]: called Keenbox disease, which is where a
bone in your wrist is basically dying.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I came up with a salve that literally
supplies immediate relief for people that
[SPEAKER_14]: have had the surgery and have that pain.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm trying to make that more readily
available.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: That should definitely sway some of the
people I encourage people that don't know
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot about cannabis to listen to my show.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that should sway them to believe a
little bit more in medical marijuana and
[SPEAKER_12]: the uses, the practical uses.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that we're not just in this just to
get as high as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, a lot of us are.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love to take fat dabs and get wrecked,
but there is definitely medicinal value in
[SPEAKER_12]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I actively use CBD in the part of my
regimen all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't just advocate it or, you know,
do what we do with the genetics and,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the breeding.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just everything in general,
I need it.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I literally, I know I'm happier
with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm calmer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a much more productive person.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have going through some of the
things that, you know, I've gone through
[SPEAKER_14]: at a young age, you know, that kind of,
you know, it weighs on you a little bit,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it gets hard sometimes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Literally, as soon as I started enriching
my cannabis diet with CBD, I've noticed a
[SPEAKER_14]: wide spectrum of problems that I was
having day to day really kind of just have
[SPEAKER_14]: more control over.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really, I don't let it get to me
anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just find myself being incredibly
more productive when I have it in my
[SPEAKER_14]: system, you know, and I can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel the same way about THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, and I'm glad that we can sit here and
talk about that because like yourself,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, you're obviously a wonderful
advocate for THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my friends, Team Landon,
they cured- Oh yeah, shout out to those
[SPEAKER_14]: guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, shout out to Sierra.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, Sierra?
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_14]: Love them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they'll be coming back soon.
[SPEAKER_14]: I miss them.
Hey, Judy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're out.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just did their New Year's and they-
Yeah, I'm stalking you guys on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're both beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, dude, we'll do a visit, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're the roomies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we'll just say hey.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, he cured his leukemia with THC
Strong Cannabis, though he started with
[SPEAKER_14]: the realm of caring, which is obviously
known for Charlotte's Web and the- Strong
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the CBD oil, which he actually wasn't
even using for the most part.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they used it as a supplement
because they noticed it was stopping what
[SPEAKER_14]: the chemo was doing, but they made it
very- They were very adamant that THC is
[SPEAKER_14]: what killed and stopped his leukemia.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, shoot, it's been,
I think, over six months since he's had a
[SPEAKER_14]: clean bill of health.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: No forced state chemo anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: State forced chemo, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: No more.
[SPEAKER_14]: All the tests have come back completely
negative.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there's no signs.
[SPEAKER_14]: He still maintains a healthy regimen.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sierra maintains as his caregiver and we
oversee, you know, all of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've seen what both sides of it does.
[SPEAKER_14]: So at the end of the day, though,
we advocate for our different compounds,
[SPEAKER_14]: our different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whole plant cannabis is what I think is
best all around the board.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: The full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: The synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shout out to Team Landon.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to hear that he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's doing awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, play this episode for me,
guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope- Put him up by the iPhone and let
him hear this, Judy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want him to hear this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: He'll love this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out, little guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you ever need anything, let me know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got your back.
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Colorado Springs is so neat.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were talking a minute ago about how the
medical community here has united because
[SPEAKER_12]: we don't have recreational.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't have the- there's not as
greedy of a vibe in cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking up at the counter.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a bunch of people just hanging
out in line just waiting to get a dab and
[SPEAKER_12]: it's all peaceful.
[SPEAKER_12]: No one's got a problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got people up there whipping up dabs
for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're pressing up rosin and everyone's
just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so peaceful.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, guys, come on down to the Canyon
Canyon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get a dab with us one of these nights.
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Come by.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll give you a CBD dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: So earlier you told me, we talked a little
bit before we hit record.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, we hung out and got comfortable,
took a bunch of dabs together,
[SPEAKER_12]: but you were telling me that you made
extracts before you even grew.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: That whole thing started as me just being
a process.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate saying that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just made oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of devalues what you're doing,
but I understand the term.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where we were, whatever the case was,
it started one way and it started becoming
[SPEAKER_14]: clear that we couldn't control,
you can only control so much of what you
[SPEAKER_14]: make because it's all in your starting
material.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to start controlling the type of
medicine that I was making instead of just
[SPEAKER_14]: processing other people's material.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, because it's hit or miss,
you have some people that put their love
[SPEAKER_14]: and their everything into their material
and it shows when you end up pulling it
[SPEAKER_14]: out and sometimes not the case.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got guys that put their fluoramide and
everything else into the oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know exactly what you mean.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the most wonderfully nice way I can
put it to start off this new year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Started processing the oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Found out that I kind of really love doing
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It caught back to my roots in chemistry
and just little things like that and
[SPEAKER_14]: seeing what people were doing with
distillation even a few years ago and
[SPEAKER_14]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing how we're coming along.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still a budding baby industry in the
chemistry world.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing to see what we're doing now
with technology that's been around for a
[SPEAKER_14]: long time and now we have these wonderful
new ways and freedoms to apply these new
[SPEAKER_14]: applications.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great to see what these guys are
doing and people are coming out with new
[SPEAKER_14]: extraction techniques, whether it's in the
solventless world or whether we're using
[SPEAKER_14]: non-polar solvents or whatever the case
is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's exciting to see across the board.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are some of the things you make?
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen you make a bunch of different
types of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_12]: Run us through the list of what you can
do.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've made suppositories for some
patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've made dog CBD biscuits.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've also made one-to-one treats for the
cancer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of our old canine friends have fatty
tumors or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, poor dog.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: We do what we can and started coming up
with some solutions to try to help those
[SPEAKER_14]: patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those parts of our family that we love.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a few myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: From there, salves, balms, different
ratios of capsules for a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_14]: ailments from everyday cannabis regimens
for a normal medical patient to an
[SPEAKER_14]: extended hospice patient where what we do
at that point is make them as comfortable
[SPEAKER_14]: as we can.
[SPEAKER_14]: These patients are in the excess of taking
anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis a day to make them comfortable
because that's what you can do.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're able to produce that reliably for
these people?
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's commendable.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything that we do, we make per
patient.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's specifically per.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing minus the salve that I've
talked about, the CBG salve, and then any
[SPEAKER_14]: collaborations that we've done with
friends like Caleb or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are things that are even close to being
mass-produced.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything is small batch.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything is individually made per
patient.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've done cannabis saline infusions as
well for those children that have to feed
[SPEAKER_14]: through G-tubes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've done- Good thinking of everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we've done some medicated lubricants
as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've done- Those work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shoot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, different concentrates.
[SPEAKER_14]: Water extracted, butane extracted.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the white CBD stuff I've seen?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: The isolate.
[SPEAKER_12]: Isolate, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: My friends team Landon have a company
called Landon's Health Hut and they work
[SPEAKER_14]: with the lab here in the States that
produces this hemp-derived 99.57% CBD
[SPEAKER_14]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_14]: At first, she started telling me about it
and I was very skeptical and I wanted more
[SPEAKER_14]: information.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then when we got in touch with the lab and
I found out that they were using American
[SPEAKER_14]: source hemp and they kind of walked us
through the process of distillating and
[SPEAKER_14]: then crystallizing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, I know it just made it sound
like it's a simplified process,
[SPEAKER_14]: but it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a matter of getting the right
material.
[SPEAKER_13]: You said you've got a chem background,
so for you it probably is just basics.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I skim the pond with the rocks at times,
but what catches really catches.
[SPEAKER_14]: Through a lot of trial and error,
you will learn.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what this industry is all about.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Trial and error is your friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I do everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: We try to focus and don't get anything out
until it's right.
[SPEAKER_14]: In the series of things, I can really only
think of one little thing that we've ever
[SPEAKER_14]: gone through.
[SPEAKER_14]: Through making edibles for someone,
I learned my mistakes and putting flax
[SPEAKER_14]: seed in there because some people are very
susceptible to that allergy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than that, I can't think of ... What
we make has really helped a lot of people
[SPEAKER_14]: across the board for all the different
ailments.
[SPEAKER_14]: We stay away from alcohol extractions as
far as RSO, any alcohol-infused tinctures
[SPEAKER_14]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just because we mostly started with
pediatric epileptic patients, any trace
[SPEAKER_14]: amounts of alcohol could ... The
medications that they have to take for the
[SPEAKER_14]: most part, even trace amounts of that
could affect and totally just give them a
[SPEAKER_14]: huge variety of complications with their
medication.
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, it's very hard on their digestive
systems.
[SPEAKER_14]: Children that are going through chemo,
children that have autism, children that
[SPEAKER_14]: have epilepsy, all have compromised immune
systems and compromised digestive systems
[SPEAKER_14]: in their own way.
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the problems that I've seen with
pediatric patients using RSO is that they
[SPEAKER_14]: have problems holding down that medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: I started going around and promoting
different carrier oils, different ways of
[SPEAKER_14]: taking this non-solvent or solvent extract
and decarboxylating and putting it into a
[SPEAKER_14]: healthier carrier oil for these children.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's an example?
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe coconut oil?
[SPEAKER_14]: Avocado oil, coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: If someone is diabetic and they want to
try a healthier route, there's always hemp
[SPEAKER_14]: seed oil, which is the healthiest.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's protein juice.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's absolutely wonderful for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I always say hemp seed oil first.
[SPEAKER_14]: If not, avocado oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Grape seed oil is another wonderful
example of something you can use other
[SPEAKER_14]: than coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people are very happy with
coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: If it works, then it works for them.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people are on the coconut oil
case.
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems to be real popular lately.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_14]: My first questions with that is if they're
a Crohn's patient or a diabetic,
[SPEAKER_14]: I ask them right away.
[SPEAKER_14]: Transparency is everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: True.
[SPEAKER_14]: This knowledge is all open source.
[SPEAKER_14]: The more you can be open with the patient
and explain it to them, the more they
[SPEAKER_14]: leave knowing at the end of the day,
the better it is in the long run.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you thought about going to
dispensaries and maybe to medical shops
[SPEAKER_12]: and teaching the budtenders this sort of
stuff?
[SPEAKER_14]: I absolutely think there's a really
important part in people, budtenders
[SPEAKER_14]: specifically, getting some form of
education because a lot of them,
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be very blunt when I say this,
a lot of them look at it as just a job.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of them come in looking at it as the
retail job.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of retail aspects to what it
is because it is a PO, a point of sale
[SPEAKER_14]: system.
[SPEAKER_14]: At the end of the day, you're dealing with
medical patients and what you're
[SPEAKER_14]: providing, what you're helping sell is a
medical product based on the
[SPEAKER_14]: recommendation of the state.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to be taken seriously like a
medical industry like we're trying to.
[SPEAKER_13]: We should take the time with the medical
patient is required.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think anyone ever got too mad at a
budtender for knowing too much proper
[SPEAKER_14]: information about their meds.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been a budtender and I've annoyed a
few people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people just don't care.
[SPEAKER_14]: You tend to feel them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: People that are just there for what they
want are there for just what they want.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those curious patients that come in and
they have genuine, real questions about
[SPEAKER_14]: things that they don't know, it's always
wonderful to have somebody there that
[SPEAKER_14]: knows what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just make them feel more welcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: More often than not, you build wonderful
business relationships with your patients
[SPEAKER_14]: and they feel comfortable coming back and
getting their medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: From people that actually know and care
about what they're providing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd rather go eat at the restaurant where
the guy remembers me and remembered,
[SPEAKER_12]: oh, you liked this last time.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just want to go back where you build a
relationship and aren't treated like
[SPEAKER_12]: customer number seven for today.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you say you don't make a Rick Simpson
oil type of product.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have an alternative?
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.
[SPEAKER_14]: I literally will infuse.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the oils that we make in
comparison are either infused with hemp
[SPEAKER_14]: seed oil, the tincture per se,
or we crank the ratios out with raw,
[SPEAKER_14]: vegan hemp seed or grapeseed oil or
coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll use that as the carrier.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've seen, I can get the dosage
almost down to similar to what it would
[SPEAKER_14]: be.
[SPEAKER_12]: And your body's going to love that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that black tar, that black sludge
is super hard for our bodies to digest.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen people get nauseous and change
colors from it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people still eat that stuff raw and I
don't understand how they can do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, you know, so we're just trying
to find better ways of easier ways for
[SPEAKER_14]: this to get into our system and healthier
ways.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rick Simpson was an innovator for what he
did, but now knowing what we know about
[SPEAKER_14]: NAFTA and the process.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, we're at a different place now
medically, so we know better and we should
[SPEAKER_14]: provide that to our patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I like your integrity on that aspect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have nothing to knock about.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have nothing but respect for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We kind of got sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were talking about you started making
hash before you started growing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how did you end up, because you weren't
satisfied with the material that was
[SPEAKER_12]: around, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Cali in the Bay was kind of,
people were on that cookies trip a few
[SPEAKER_14]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, I know about the cookie hype.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was all about the cookies.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, all right, a lot of the
CBD flour that was coming out was looking
[SPEAKER_14]: like grass clippings or, it was really
bad.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to be mean.
[SPEAKER_12]: Plants are hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the CBD heavy plants are not as easy
to grow as some of the more THC or Cetivo
[SPEAKER_12]: or Indica dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for recognizing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: As a breeder and a grower, I recognize
that heavily.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like CBD dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: So here's the thing, as a grower that
started out just growing CBD dominant
[SPEAKER_14]: plants, the first time I popped some seeds
that were THC dominant, I was like,
[SPEAKER_14]: this is really easy.
[SPEAKER_13]: You had the curve now and you just took
off the training wheels and wanted to fly.
[SPEAKER_14]: The curves that I had to deal with for
growing the CBD were not what I was
[SPEAKER_14]: dealing with and growing some very
wonderful THC genetics that I had been
[SPEAKER_14]: gifted.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was just like, oh my God,
this is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a little bit... Those CBD plants
will harm on you.
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't grow very well.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to be happy all the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Your ratios will be affected severely if
there's any sort of stress during the
[SPEAKER_14]: vegetative state whatsoever, because that
CBD is already there in the vegetative
[SPEAKER_14]: state before it's been flipped or
anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: So glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_12]: People often completely overlook their veg
state.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've watched people build $10,000 flower
rooms and spend six or 800 bucks just
[SPEAKER_12]: fixing up a shitty old bedroom to make a
veg space.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, come on, do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's like you said, that's where
the plant starts.
[SPEAKER_14]: The starting stage of life.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're growing from seed, you obviously
want to flex your tapper.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to make your plants as sturdy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good, strong adolescence before you put
them in an adult room.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I learned that with CBD plants the very
hard way.
[SPEAKER_14]: And every time something happened,
I would call one of my friends and be
[SPEAKER_14]: like, look, this is what I'm going
through, please.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to thank... I just want to say
this now and if it's okay if I shot them
[SPEAKER_14]: out.
Always.
[SPEAKER_14]: Offer Chronic Genes, my friend Clancy has
been one of the most stand up guys that I
[SPEAKER_14]: know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually have free CBD seeds in my book
bag from him right now that I'm just
[SPEAKER_14]: remembering.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will gladly donate free CBD seeds to
anyone that wants them right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope people in this room heard that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, legit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'll gladly say it again.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, he's been a wonderful,
wonderful friend and Josh from La Plata
[SPEAKER_14]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, good dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, yeah, every breeder, every person
that I've talked about what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_14]: do with CBD has been completely open
source with me and helpful and any little
[SPEAKER_14]: thing that it's literally fast tracked me
so much that it's a blessing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm completely grateful for the knowledge
that's been dropped on me because it took
[SPEAKER_14]: me from trying to provide for my patients
and struggling to knowing things that I
[SPEAKER_14]: just would have never grasped before.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like I said, it's I'm truly
grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I started as an extractor.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just took one of my friends getting
screwed over basically for me to say,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know what, dude, I'll grow for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Step up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Became very public about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I first started growing,
my problem was people hoard these or they
[SPEAKER_14]: were hoarding these strains.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was like, well, let's share them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's, you know, let's pull cuts and,
you know, give them out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I you can only help as many people as
you can get this cut out to, which is
[SPEAKER_14]: something I'll touch into later.
[SPEAKER_14]: But my main source was, you know,
OK, well, let's make this happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: So my time in Cali, people were on this
crazy cookies craze.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going from NorCal to SoCal and
really in Southern California,
[SPEAKER_14]: no hits at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: No progress whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Northern California is where I fell in
love with a wonderful plant called Sour
[SPEAKER_14]: Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I met an amazing group of breeders in
the Emerald Triangle that changed my life.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were already caregivers for some of
the children in the state going through
[SPEAKER_14]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_14]: These men showed me what real compassion
was at the very starting point when I was
[SPEAKER_14]: in this industry and blessed me with some
genetics and knowledge and pointing me in
[SPEAKER_14]: the right directions of things for what I
wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a name to shout out,
like a crew name or something.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ringo, you know, he's no longer with us,
man.
[SPEAKER_14]: The spirit lives on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a there's a lot of them,
you know, they know if they hear this,
[SPEAKER_14]: they know who they are.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're the kind hearted people who don't
do this for the name.
[SPEAKER_14]: They just do this for the sake of
continuing to push cannabis forward,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, for the sake of.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they've got my respect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So these people in NorCal, you find this
crew in NorCal and you follow in love with
[SPEAKER_12]: them.
[SPEAKER_12]: You find Sour Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You start growing that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Started asking questions, started doing
runs with the plant specifically.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then people started talking about this
plant, this, you know, because at the
[SPEAKER_14]: time, even California, there was such a
hype about Colorado and Charlotte's Web
[SPEAKER_14]: and what it really was.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all these guys in California had no
clue.
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you had these streams popping up
like Sour Tsunami and they're like,
[SPEAKER_14]: oh, well, it's just like Sour Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you had Harlequin popping up in
Harborside down by Oakland.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was one of the stronger three to
one, two to ones.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're like, no, it's nothing like
Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then this ACDC plant started to come
around, you know, and people just started
[SPEAKER_14]: comparing them because no one knew as all
these new strains are coming out.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were.
[SPEAKER_12]: From Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that a Colorado strain, the ACDC?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it is not.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wanted to know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it started in Spain,
from what I believe.
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that.
[SPEAKER_14]: From what I understand, it started in
Spain and somehow made its way to
[SPEAKER_14]: California.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then from that's just from what I
understand, from what I've been told.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, as far as our Colorado CBD
strains, you know, R4, R5, the RU5.
[SPEAKER_14]: Toro Bora is well known around here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Toro Bora, Toro Sue, you know,
the work that Natural Mystic Caregivers
[SPEAKER_14]: down here in the Springs of Douglas.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Blueberry Sue, the Harlequin Sue,
the Blueberry Ox.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Canna Sue, you know, all those are
absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_14]: Great strain.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Natural Mystic for they're
one of the only shops that really focuses
[SPEAKER_12]: heavily on CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can find a three or four different
kinds of top shelf flower that are CBD
[SPEAKER_14]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually one of my favorite places in
the Springs to go to for CBD flower
[SPEAKER_14]: because, you know, I support any place
that will put good CBD products on their
[SPEAKER_14]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know the growers there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Joey pretty well.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do a good job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out, Joey.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope you're listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: What else was I going to ask you?
[SPEAKER_12]: I got so many questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: You were talking about labs that getting
your stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have a lab that you prefer?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there was a friend of ours that has
an independent lab and he really does help
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of people with low cost testing and
does his part to help.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Colorado law is made a little
hard for caregivers, patients,
[SPEAKER_14]: parents to have their meds tested because
obviously most labs are forced to deal
[SPEAKER_14]: with people that have MIPS licenses,
whatever the case is.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are those few independent people
who have taken it upon themselves with
[SPEAKER_14]: their own dollar to provide a place where
patients can have their meds tested.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's actually a place like that
down here in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have all the information,
so I don't want to shout out.
[SPEAKER_14]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nate knows who he is and he's definitely
killing it down here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So once I get more information,
I'll gladly pass along your way and we can
[SPEAKER_14]: share it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we'll get it out to the people.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the one who did the testing for the
cannabis cup entry that Caleb and I did.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's done some other testing for the oil
that I've done before.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the numbers have always come spot on
to the point where if I go somewhere else
[SPEAKER_14]: and I feel like my numbers aren't right,
I go to Nate because my numbers are always
[SPEAKER_14]: right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can count on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the cannabis cup is coming up.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's January.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys were recording in 2016 and it
sounds so weird to say that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to do anything for the cup
this year?
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are some few plans for the cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm keeping myself open right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: The way that they split up SoCal for the
two weekends is a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So honestly, that is why we kind of backed
out of doing anything so quickly.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we had some things going.
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, you know, with whatever happens
in Denver, we'll have a show going out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is something in California that
is calling my attention that, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: a few people reach out.
[SPEAKER_14]: You never know what collabs you might see.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Queen Bee Extracts,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: She was the CBD winner for Chalice,
I believe, and won.
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's doing great things out there in
California.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure you support the Chalice
Festival, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey Man, Glass Nuggets is the sponsor of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm like definitely looking forward to
seeing what will come to fruition between
[SPEAKER_14]: now and the cup season, as we all know
what that refers to.
[SPEAKER_12]: Five days this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's one more day.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's either the Friday before or the
Wednesday at the end there.
[SPEAKER_12]: For Denver?
[SPEAKER_12]: For Denver.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because 420 is on a Wednesday,
I think.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's either Tuesday or Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're just stretching it out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm incredibly excited for whatever
they want to do for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have a good time.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you know that the MED has their
feelings about how cannabis events should
[SPEAKER_14]: be and what they are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a huge opposition to a lot of
the way that these events are run.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your two cents, if I can ask
personally, on how that goes here for
[SPEAKER_14]: people like us, you know, that obviously
have companies and promote within,
[SPEAKER_14]: as well as the people who enjoy these
events?
[SPEAKER_12]: What it does for me is I work for a
MED-regulated dispensary, so I can't take
[SPEAKER_12]: my seed company and set up a booth because
I'm affiliated with that dispensary so
[SPEAKER_12]: closely that I'll be fined.
[SPEAKER_12]: My dispensary will be fined if I'm there
selling products or giving products out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I understand that.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you get your MED badge, that's part
of what you sign.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I feel that dispensaries, this is
Colorado, we're allowed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone there is 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in an enclosed area.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be able to, the dispensary
should be able to go and set up a booth
[SPEAKER_12]: and show our wares just like any other
industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have beer festivals where, I'm not
going to name any beer brands,
[SPEAKER_12]: but whatever brand A, B, and C bring their
beer truck.
[SPEAKER_12]: They set up beer, they serve it to people
all day.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they shut down whole blocks,
you know, to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, whole blocks of downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're doing this at a private event area
at the, I forget the name of the place,
[SPEAKER_12]: the X, no it's not, Denver Mart.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're renting a place, we're not even
doing it in the city blocks.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that the dispensary should be able
to come set up a booth and bring smoke and
[SPEAKER_12]: smoke you and I out and everybody out.
[SPEAKER_12]: They should say, this is our flagship
strain.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what we grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come check us out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it should be fully allowed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of crap that it's not.
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad to get your two cents on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you know, being an independent
caregiver on the other side of it,
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't necessarily have to answer to
them, but at some point, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: we cross paths and things are mentioned.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's interesting for people that are
running within that model.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Colorado and how that affects us for
trying to actively promote at events like
[SPEAKER_14]: this, you know, without being threatened
with fines or whatever the case may be,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, fines and your business closed,
which, you know, a big enough fine and
[SPEAKER_12]: green and healthy is a small, small
business.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a few of us and a large enough fine
would end us.
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be the end.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to be pretty careful on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't even risk it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish you guys all the best.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be down there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you guys open this whole week for the
software?
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that working?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're officially open.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this will come out.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're open today, but this will come out
in like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be full on open.
[SPEAKER_14]: By the time you guys hear this,
I will have checked them out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, he will.
[SPEAKER_12]: He'll be back to give you guys a review on
what he thinks of the turpix.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I definitely will.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come check out the shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a couple of cool rigs there and
some stuff you'd want to see.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: I took some notes, but I think I've gone
through them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, I love how cool Colorado Springs is.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have one of these in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is kind of chill to be able to
come.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there may be one, but it's real low
key and I haven't gone there yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's open yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: So as soon as it opens, I'll go check it
out.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is chill.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's just hanging out, having a good
conversation, taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cloudy as shit in here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's an incredibly cool vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then just let us come hang out and do a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I can get Camille's attention to
come say hi.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: She didn't hear me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to bug her.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's being social.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's a great host here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone here is super gracious.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love coming here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'll be here a lot more often.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, bro, we've been going for like
40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got anything else that you want to
throw out to the world about CBD while
[SPEAKER_12]: you're on the microphone?
[SPEAKER_12]: You will be back on the show, so if you
forgot anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll have another opportunity.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I started this company because obviously
something happened to me, to somebody that
[SPEAKER_14]: I can help.
[SPEAKER_14]: My goal is to help as many people as I can
because if you know that feeling of not
[SPEAKER_14]: being able to help someone, but then are
put in a position where you can,
[SPEAKER_14]: why not?
Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so every day I encourage people to
learn something new about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: I encourage people to take up a cause
that's close to them.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, it's epilepsy awareness and I will
talk about it until my face turns blue and
[SPEAKER_14]: you know more about epilepsy than you did
before we started talking.
[SPEAKER_12]: I learned a lot today.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really glad.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that being said, like that's just my
main focus with everything that I do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Jeff, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, thanks for coming, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know that anything in the
iRegenetics lineup is always available to
you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't do a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like there are a lot of people out
there doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you do need my help, you let me
know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that from the bottom of my
heart.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Back at you, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like a great way to wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?
[SPEAKER_12]: One more big shout out to the Canna
Canyon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to everybody here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to all the people to my left
that listened to this ridiculous podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's been super awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're over there half listening.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be back to close the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks again for coming.
Anytime.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to take some dabs now,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to hit stop recording.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was episode number 114.

[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fox once again for coming down and doing a

[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, I'll be back in seven days with
another podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to wrap up this show with some
fortunate youth.
[SPEAKER_12]: The song is for a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_12]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, mama, yes, I've got you on the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, telling you that I'm coming through
the red bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I'm coming under bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, you know it's wrong,
and oh, you do it so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I want a song that can do no wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're going to see yourself a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me tripping.

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, tell me that justice is wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's so wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, your mama tried to go in three
demands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're telling me that I'm going to
do some talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, mama, tell me so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one day I hate to see my son do all
the go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So free those minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, all of those minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, tell me you lost your mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: You
[SPEAKER_04]: got me tripping.
You
[SPEAKER_04]: got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're my son, and I hate to see you
go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're my free man, and you're still
going through the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, bring me down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's not just when you're on the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can take this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I hope I make it over long.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: You
[SPEAKER_04]: got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's so far.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so far.

You got me tripping.

[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
Oh, you got me tripping.
Oh, you got me tripping.

[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you got me tripping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you got me I started off loving an
old-school bong head.
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember back in the day?
[SPEAKER_12]: I do remember that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the most gigantic bong head I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the bong in the car.
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to be the bong guy and now
everybody knows me.
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember back when you were doing the
bong with the hot plate and the dabs on
[SPEAKER_15]: the bong.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the skillet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Big D from Broadway Wellness
who sold me my very first real dab rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the first cannabis cup when I first
got that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That old, the dub tube with the little
swing arm skillet on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it evolved quickly from bongs
right into the hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I like to take like half gram dabs out
of a nice Hitman rig, which that's a good
[SPEAKER_12]: way to work into this advertising here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I like to buy a new rig, I like to
shop in an American store and buy an
[SPEAKER_12]: American product.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to buy a rig made by an American
person, not a Chinese kid with no
[SPEAKER_12]: protective eyewear.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chinese kid not getting paid a real wage.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want something made in America.
[SPEAKER_12]: Buy an American.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hitman rigs are made by dabbers.
[SPEAKER_12]: These guys dab as hard as you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Big shout out to my buddy Dougie at Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure you follow at Hitman Glass,
Dougie on Instagram, and also visit www
[SPEAKER_12]: .hitmanglass.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, Hitman is a great company.
[SPEAKER_12]: I support them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, you should check out the Chalice
Festival.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're going to be in California this
summer, the Chalice Festival, what is the
[SPEAKER_12]: slogan there?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hash music and art.
[SPEAKER_12]: What could be better?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hash music and art, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys want to go to the Chalice
Festival with me in California?
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's over the 7-10 weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's go out to California and get down
at Chalice.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to get out there this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: You never know what could happen in Rosted
Jebs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Rob from the Sour Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob, I hope you're doing better,
bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob had a health scare.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was supposed to be on the show tonight.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will get him back in the very near
future.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob, take good care of yourself,
brother.
[SPEAKER_12]: Much love from everybody at the table.
[SPEAKER_12]: Much love from the whole iRegenetics and
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole team, the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, get better, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's scary.
[SPEAKER_12]: You told me that shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sincerely worried.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're second that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody here has got this somber look on
their face now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We went from having fun and taking dabs
to, oh shit, what's wrong with Rob?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's all your fault, Rob.
[SPEAKER_12]: We love you, Rob.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we kind of put together an impromptu
show.
[SPEAKER_12]: I called my friends over.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, dude, my guest bailed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on, help me out with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we got Carlos.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got Alan here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to talk about a few random
things.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before I get there, I have to let you guys
know the stickers from the hashtag,
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it when you ramble, Twitter
campaign, whatever that was called.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those stickers should have landed at your
door.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you participated in that, check your
mail.
[SPEAKER_12]: They should have some stickers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got an email I want to read.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm prepared, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, hey now, just wanted to drop a
note and say how much I loved episode 112
[SPEAKER_12]: or how I got into the business.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great story.
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking forward to the grow focused shows.
[SPEAKER_12]: This guy also says he's waiting to hear if
he gets hired for a job in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, dude, I really wish you good luck on
the job in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_12]: And man, thanks for listening and thanks
for the kind words about episode 112.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really like hearing from the listeners.
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes all the effort I put into this
show super worth it.
[SPEAKER_12]: All you guys got to do is say thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got an email you'd like to send
to me, it's growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_12]: .com.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can also find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: Since I'm telling you about the email,
the last episode was all about CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had our friend Fox from Foxtracks come
on to talk about CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: A friend of mine told me that that episode
made her cry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry and you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's making you cry, we're doing
something right, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you've got questions from the CBD
episode, I encourage you to email me those
[SPEAKER_12]: questions and I will get Fox back on the
show and we will do round two of CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So our first topic that I wanted to bring
up on social media lately, there have been
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of crazy pictures.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you guys seen the picture of the
super clear shatter that that guy posted?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I have, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen that picture of a super clear
shatter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Turn your face toward the mic a little
more, please.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to get you in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You see how good you sound?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, much better now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw that picture that was going around
on Facebook of the super clear shatter.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was just, I couldn't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know exactly how they did it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want me to tell you how they did
it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they put, so actually nature put a
puddle of water on the hood of somebody's
[SPEAKER_12]: car and then it got really cold outside
and they picked it up and they carried it
[SPEAKER_12]: inside and held it in front of a vac oven
with gloves on and took a picture of it
[SPEAKER_12]: and posted it to the social media.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's just a piece of ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody, when they saw the vac oven and
the rubber gloves, everybody on social
[SPEAKER_12]: media just went, oh shit, look at this
hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fucking ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's ice hash is all that is.
[SPEAKER_15]: I felt that right off the bat too.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought there's no way that's possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: They let that ride for a few days,
but then they went and they're like,
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey everybody, it's just ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shout out for fooling everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: I should have pulled up the Instagram
account.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hashtag hoax.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you guys were blown away by that
super clear hash that was held up a few
[SPEAKER_12]: days ago on Instagram, a lot of people
were reposting.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was all over Facebook.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was all over the social media.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was frozen water.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can make hash that clear.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're doing it in the freezer right now,
probably.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you live in the right part of the
country, it's happening in your backyard
[SPEAKER_12]: right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could do it in Pueblo tonight.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going on right here in our
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_12]: So sorry to burst everybody's bubble.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was just a piece of ice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So another social media thing that has
been really catching a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_12]: lately.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a glass convention in Las Vegas
just recently.
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure that was Vegas.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, there's a glass convention,
an industry convention or a mothership
[SPEAKER_12]: rig, a Sagan and Scott Deppy collab sold.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, I want you to sit down before I
tell you how much this rig sold for.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're driving, you might want to pull
over.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're at work, put down your knife.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody bought a hash rig for $101,000.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even believe that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly overpaid by a grand.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was an auction style.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the other guy was like, a hundred Gs
and this guy's like a hundred and one.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they gave it to him for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a lot of money for a hash rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: How much hash do you have?
[SPEAKER_12]: You better be smoking the best hash ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, if I remember correctly,
when I was looking at it, did it have a
[SPEAKER_15]: flower bowl set up right up on it right
away?
[SPEAKER_15]: That was actually a mothership honey
bucket.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like a big bowl, but the skillet
swings in and out of there.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it does look like a big fat bowl.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I like that you said that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's open up that flood gate.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to say this on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: About 5,000 people are going to listen to
this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure at least a hundred of them
are going to send me dirty emails.
[SPEAKER_12]: That rig is fucking ugly.
[SPEAKER_12]: $101,000 for a really ugly rig.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a connoisseur on many other things as
it comes to weed and flowers, connoisseur,
[SPEAKER_15]: oil and all that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But that rig was, man, it was all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's got a gaudy ass base.
[SPEAKER_12]: So one thing I should mention,
this rig is covered in moons.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you turn the rig around slowly,
it goes through the phases of the moon.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that Debbie pointed out,
Scott Debbie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Scott Debbie.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to Sagan Glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great work you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think it's ugly.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously enough people love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So don't be mad at me for thinking it's
ugly.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people, somebody paid $101,000.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's obviously not ugly.
[SPEAKER_10]: One person loved it a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: Loved the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Way more than I hated it.
[SPEAKER_12]: He loves it 101,000 times more than I
dislike it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think it's ugly, but it's poorly
planned.
[SPEAKER_12]: The base is God awful ugly.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got moons glued to it on the base.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in this odd shape.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like the base was just,
they made the top and they're like,
[SPEAKER_12]: well, we need something big enough to hold
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they made that gaudy base and then they
put a, I think the color would be called
[SPEAKER_12]: stardust, black stardust, Faberge egg.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you guys know anything about glass,
the Fab egg is the artwork.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the way to go, but they made it out
of a color of glass you can't see through.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you could barely tell that it's a Fab
egg.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like a grenade.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly what it looks like
actually.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any way you can pull this up?
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a picture here on my phone
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: I posted it up to social media,
so it shouldn't be too hard to find.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will pull this up for you to take a
look at.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it looks like poorly planned.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it looks like they just glued
moons around it to give it the moon vibe
[SPEAKER_12]: that they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said that I wanted to buy it and
just glue a rocket to it just to complete
[SPEAKER_12]: the whole space theme.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I found the, Oh, look, there was the image
right away.
[SPEAKER_12]: So give me a minute to find the image.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause Facebook likes to do that thing
where it jumps around.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pulling it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a rig that somebody paid $101,000
for.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got some great colors to it,
but it looks like something that less clay
[SPEAKER_12]: people or Tim Burton would have put
together in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a very good, and mothership is
known for a really clean, sleek,
[SPEAKER_12]: smooth, tight baller status.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, their rigs are gorgeous and clean
and perfect and flawless.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this thing, this doesn't come close.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're seeing, I like that Alan's not
really into the glass scene.
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't, he hasn't mentioned anything
about glass in the time that I've known
[SPEAKER_12]: him.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's out of the loop there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he just does, he already knows that
that doesn't fit the mothership motto.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mothership, I'll give you guys a shout out
though.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those new race car themed rigs are the
bee's knees, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a couple of those that I really,
really love.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like I'm doing too much,
pulling up stuff on the phone here,
[SPEAKER_12]: but I'll show you guys these race car rigs
because they are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can do editing if any of this gets
carried away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hit me or mothership.
[SPEAKER_12]: These rigs, I'm going to try to describe
it now since I'm pulling it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they took a normal Taurus rig,
which would be clear and they have used
[SPEAKER_12]: yellow glass on one portion and blue glass
on another.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it looks really sleek and it's super
smooth.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they call it the race car series.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a Klein.
[SPEAKER_12]: And where the Klein function happens,
they used clear glass to make a window so
[SPEAKER_12]: that you can see the water bubble in
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really love the race car series.
[SPEAKER_12]: Check that one out.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is very cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shout out to mothership glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do not like that expensive piece,
but I really love the race car series.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_15]: With the clear window.
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks good, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is very good.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a tight look.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that rig levitating in that picture?
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems that rig is levitating,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I wondered if I was the only one that
noticed that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to mothership.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how you made that happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: I should probably stop talking about
mothership since I'm sponsored by Hitman
[SPEAKER_12]: Glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Buy yourself a Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we all agree that that rig was way
overpriced, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, it definitely was.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think everybody at this table does
financially well.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all kind of in the legal cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the most money that you would find
acceptable to pay cash for a rig at this
[SPEAKER_12]: point in your life?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd pay a good $150 for a good rig.
[SPEAKER_15]: $150?
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: $150.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have to go to a trade show
and pick up a Hitman because that's the
[SPEAKER_12]: only way you're going to find one for that
price.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone gives me shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: They break.
[SPEAKER_12]: You smoke cash out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_10]: $250, I think.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to go $250.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not a dabber, so I'm guessing
you're going to buy a nice bong or a good
[SPEAKER_12]: pipe at that point.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey guys, I want you to send me a tweet to
at GFYH podcast and tell me right now if
[SPEAKER_12]: you're going to buy a rig, what you would
find to be a reasonable budget.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you in the $101,000 range or are you
over here like Carlos with the $150 rig?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm using a Hitman E-Series sidecar in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one, say I bought this at Illusions
Glass in Denver, and this was a $550 rig
[SPEAKER_12]: at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's worth that at this
point, but it was at that time.
[SPEAKER_12]: In front of me here is the, shout out to
Hitman Glass once again.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would put down $250 for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one on their website is $800 for the
short stack.
[SPEAKER_12]: Guys, Hitman sent this to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you won that lottery, if you won the
lottery, you'd buy two of those,
[SPEAKER_15]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I still have that ticket.
[SPEAKER_15]: The Powerball.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to check out those numbers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad you came here and recorded a
podcast before you checked out your
[SPEAKER_12]: Powerball numbers, because if you won
that, I would not have seen you tonight.
[SPEAKER_12]: You would be calling me from Costa Rica
like, hey bro, can we reschedule that?
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that I wanted to talk about
since everybody at the table is into the
[SPEAKER_12]: legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should back up and talk about how we
ran into each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have known you since I was the budtender
at Metamar.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was 2008 when we got closed.
[SPEAKER_12]: You were one of our first patients that
would come in and buy medicine from us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you come in when it was in the
apartment upstairs?
[SPEAKER_12]: I did.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you got to see it evolve from that
guy's couch.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't talk about that guy's name on the
show.
[SPEAKER_12]: We leave names out to protect the
innocent, but it went from that guy's
[SPEAKER_12]: couch and then it went to the middle floor
and then we moved it down to the main
[SPEAKER_12]: floor and then we busted it out and went
hardcore for a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: 2008 is when that shop was really booming.
[SPEAKER_12]: 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, 2008 is how long I've known this
guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he used to shop at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_12]: Which Tom Sexton pretty much handed the
keys to me and it was like, here you go,
[SPEAKER_12]: run this shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: So since then we've both gotten into that
shop was legal, quasi legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how legal that shop was.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what we would call that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was such a gray area.
[SPEAKER_12]: We called it the wild, wild west.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was growing herb at the house and Tom
was growing herb at the house and we would
[SPEAKER_12]: take it and put it on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then customers would show up with a
backpack and you'd know, they'd be like,
[SPEAKER_12]: I just need to talk to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they'd send them back and they'd come
talk to me and they'd be like,
[SPEAKER_12]: look at all this weed I grew.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you guys want to buy it?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we just buy it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it was good enough and they wanted a
reasonable price, we could buy the weed
[SPEAKER_12]: from them and put it on the shelves at
that point.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the good old days.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the herb was a little bit better
back then.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Boutique batches are much better than
these large scale.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I work in a large scale girl.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's a different type of thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a, it's a totally different monster.
[SPEAKER_12]: The airflow is different.
[SPEAKER_12]: The temperature control is different.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one of the things I've noticed
about everything is that commercial grows
[SPEAKER_15]: are just, oh my God, they're just,
it seems like I can't believe how weed
[SPEAKER_15]: back in the day was so much better.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was just people working with almost
no budget compared to people who have
[SPEAKER_15]: millions, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, and a lot of that is because the
passion, the industry evolved,
[SPEAKER_12]: the rules evolved to where only people
with a million dollars can play in the
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis game right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to have a million dollars to get
involved in the cannabis game,
[SPEAKER_12]: to have a legal shop and to grow a grow
that supports that shop, to be able to
[SPEAKER_12]: open and have a clean environment to build
your grow and a retail environment and to
[SPEAKER_12]: hire a staff and to get product and to get
insurance and to get security.
[SPEAKER_12]: Security is so expensive to open any type
of anything, uh, marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_12]: division regulated every square foot where
people can go needs to be covered by a
[SPEAKER_12]: camera.
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's a doorway, they want a camera
on both sides of the door so that if they
[SPEAKER_12]: look at two camera views on the monitor,
they can see you leave one room and enter
[SPEAKER_12]: the other room flawlessly.
[SPEAKER_12]: There can be no gaps in your travel on the
cameras.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it costs you a million bucks to get
into the industry nowadays.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what sucks about that is people like
you and I, we have heart.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got mad heart.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been doing this since before we
should even admit we were growing in our
[SPEAKER_12]: basements.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were getting it on.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we've got heart.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have a million dollars because we
had to hide.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had to, we were growing weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: We weren't going to college.
[SPEAKER_12]: We weren't running a car dealership.
[SPEAKER_12]: We weren't doing whatever these other guys
are doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had to make our own money.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now that we've got it, uh,
your headphones, all right?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'll tap them.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tap them and they'll start working.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, maybe I'll wiggle the cable.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got a great voice man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hear you over the headphones.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as you're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll edit that part out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm good too.
[SPEAKER_15]: 17 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_15]: You good?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys can hear me?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: We can hear you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's his headphones.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mine just went on.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't ever buy the HA04 headphone
amplifier from Livewire.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're a guitar center and they offer
you that, uh, give them a dirty look and
[SPEAKER_12]: buy the one that's $20 more expensive.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be well worth your time guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're talking about this industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't have a million dollars,
you can't get into the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_12]: but Los and I, Carlos and I have mad
passion.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wouldn't be able to buy a shop right
now and set that up because we've been
[SPEAKER_12]: growing weed and living like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to kind of hide when you're a
cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: Back in the day, we couldn't have all the
money that we had.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had to hide that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We couldn't go open a store because we
couldn't talk about, how'd you make this
[SPEAKER_12]: money?
[SPEAKER_12]: I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: You had to kind of be on the down low.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the people that are able to open shops
now are guys that have had other
[SPEAKER_12]: businesses that were doing other things
and no offense to those guys, but they
[SPEAKER_12]: don't have the heart that somebody like
you and I have about the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a business to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they have an accountant and a lawyer
and then the master growers are the guys
[SPEAKER_12]: that are just supposed to go grow their
employees.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to point this at your face.
[SPEAKER_12]: You sound better when you're talking to
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I was kind of getting at a little
bit is right now master growers and head
[SPEAKER_12]: growers, I'm called a lead cultivator is
my official title.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hated the word master grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we changed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_12]: I lead the cultivation team.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're making hella good money.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we're being paid fat chunky salaries
as lead cultivators in this industry right
[SPEAKER_12]: now.
[SPEAKER_12]: People that have been at it for I've been
growing cannabis for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been involved in the cannabis
industry or the cannabis scene for,
[SPEAKER_12]: wow, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to think about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been messing with weed for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you guys, there's a big difference
between being like a weed grower and a
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis caregiver and being in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not paying taxes on it and you
don't have some kind of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_12]: any deregulated license, you can't say
you're in the industry in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're just growing weed now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of the new standard we're going
to make here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't say I do this in the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're underground.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get on paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pay taxes, do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_12]: But so what I'm saying is the people that
own the industry, they have all kinds of
[SPEAKER_12]: money now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the people like myself that are
making good money, we better stick to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We better make a fat resume.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys that are trimming, making,
I know trimmers that make anywhere between
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 and 20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're making good money trimming,
start documenting how many hours you've
[SPEAKER_12]: been trimming.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're using a trim machine,
if you're using the satellite,
[SPEAKER_12]: if you're using the ripper, document how
many hours you use on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Put that as part of your resume.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you know how, if you're applicator
certified, that goes on your resume
[SPEAKER_12]: because in the future, this is going to
turn into just a basic job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, people like Alan said over
here, it's a business.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's headed that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Owners aren't going to want to pay the
next set of growers my salary.
[SPEAKER_12]: The people that come after me are not
going to get paid what this group of
[SPEAKER_12]: growers are getting paid.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to start tapering off because
what I think creates a high dollar product
[SPEAKER_12]: is an illegal product.
[SPEAKER_12]: Since it was illegal, it was highly in
demand.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there wasn't any supply.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: We could grow the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have to hide.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are we charging so much for it?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only for production.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once we catch up with production,
which won't take too long, we're building
[SPEAKER_12]: their greenhouses going up every single
day.
[SPEAKER_12]: So once we catch up with the production,
I see prices going down and then the
[SPEAKER_12]: producers are going to start being paid
less and less.
[SPEAKER_12]: Trimmers aren't going to get hired on for
15 an hour anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: The industry is going to taper off.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be any other agricultural industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll find more temporary staffing going
on it probably.
[SPEAKER_10]: But getting back to the leaf cultivator,
like any industry, I do believe that if
[SPEAKER_10]: you can show someone that you are worth
your money, you can get a higher wage for
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can go in there and you can
increase production and show them that you
[SPEAKER_10]: can do it, you can bring it up 10,
15, 20%.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll still have a competitive edge over
someone else to be able to present that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You make good recommendations of
absolutely documenting your history and
[SPEAKER_10]: what you've been able to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's going to make a lot of
difference.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that works in any industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Document what you're doing, have proof.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just harder in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: But as we're evolving, a lot of guys like
us, we're ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_12]: So stay ahead of the game and document
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get stuck in your bubble and write
down everything that you're learning.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that goes on a resume.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, if you can use the satellite,
that goes on your resume.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can use the OBDOS, that goes on
your resume.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can run a sweet leaf extractor,
that goes on your resume.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because eventually you guys, you're not
going to... So Alan brought up a good
[SPEAKER_12]: point.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can impress them and you can jump in
and make a few more dollars on your
[SPEAKER_12]: salary.
[SPEAKER_12]: But a lot of those guys, a lot of those
jobs are taken by guys like us that got a
[SPEAKER_12]: jump on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's the next wave of people.
[SPEAKER_12]: All the rock stars are kind of doing that
now.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have to be a badass to get
that kind of a salary in the future,
[SPEAKER_12]: I think.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I agree with you on that a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still going to come down to
networking too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've worked in other industries.
[SPEAKER_10]: Networking was important.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have those crossover
relationships.
[SPEAKER_10]: But nothing like this industry,
if I ever experienced the words,
[SPEAKER_10]: so I'll use the word incestuous,
it really is.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to know someone in a lot of
instances to get in the door.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I was pretty fortunate.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got hired on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only been in the industry about eight
months now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've been badged.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've worked at a couple other
facilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting at the ground level, literally.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did walk into one place and with my
crossover skills and my resume,
[SPEAKER_10]: I was able to get in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've had to work and hustle to learn
this industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it does matter a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can name drop a little bit,
I think it helps a tremendous amount more
[SPEAKER_10]: so in this industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can completely testify to your
statement.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would not be in the position I'm in if I
weren't.
[SPEAKER_12]: I earned it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I earned the spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if I did not know Grimy Gatsby,
if I wasn't tight with Hunt like I was,
[SPEAKER_12]: I would not have found my spot where I am.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was my homie from before he had a spot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when things went wrong, he called me
right away, like, you can grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So get out and join the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's kind of what you were
bringing up.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can join some other clubs or
anything like that, some social groups
[SPEAKER_15]: that are- I think just getting out and
getting your badge first is always- Go get
[SPEAKER_15]: your badge.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get your badge.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the very first thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a brief episode on how to get your
badge.
[SPEAKER_12]: I should do a complete in-depth episode on
how to get your badge.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to make a note of that here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to do this in the phone here
since it's right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Episode about badge.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, guys, I'll do a full episode on
how to get your badge.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll do a little update thing for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you guys are new, kind of fairly new to
the legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we talk about what you guys are doing
or is that- Would you like to keep some of
[SPEAKER_12]: that quiet for now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I won't mention who I'm with because
I don't think it's the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I'm just in quality control.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trimming, if you will.
[SPEAKER_10]: But really those- You'd mentioned dropping
the master grower and lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_10]: The trimmer is the last- Well,
not the last person, but one of the last
[SPEAKER_10]: people to see what that product is going
to be like when it gets out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it has turned into more of a quality
control issue in the industry,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you hear that forward thinking,
you guys?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something we need in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not just a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are a quality control.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're inspecting my buds that I handed to
you to trim.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're the last eyes that are going to
look at them before we put them in a jar
[SPEAKER_12]: and customers touch them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to be- What did I call that
the other day on?
[SPEAKER_15]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_15]: What would I call that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Flawnspector.
[SPEAKER_15]: Flawnspector.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, look for seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Look for mildew.
[SPEAKER_15]: Flawnspector.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look for anything that we may have
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, find it for us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the last eye is before it hits the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Quality control.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so be a forward thinker.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're going to come join the cannabis
industry, just like he's saying,
[SPEAKER_12]: you're not just trimming it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not staring into the buds all day.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are making sure they are beautiful so
that when I put them in the jar and the
[SPEAKER_12]: patients come in, they go, oh,
who trimmed that black cherry Kim?
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to smoke it all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, especially on the hand trimming.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fun skill to learn.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it takes a lot of technique and it
can be boring, but I mean, you have some
[SPEAKER_10]: great conversations over the table.
[SPEAKER_10]: You meet such a wide variety of people.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have personalities in the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So many different people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've been out doing other
industries, real estate for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually find that I'm always the
minority at the table and I'm the native.
[SPEAKER_15]: I always find that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I always find that out to be.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone else is from out of state.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, everybody's moving to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody's moving here.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's getting a little crowded.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's starting to get the rents going up.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's getting a little bit full.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have an abundance of labor for the
market, so it is competitive.
[SPEAKER_10]: So work on your skills and work on getting
to know people in the industry where
[SPEAKER_10]: someone will give you a chance.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then like every other thing, show up and
do your stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a place where you just sit around
and party.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a lot of people that want
to get into the industry because they
[SPEAKER_10]: think it was like high school where
everybody just sits around and toks around
[SPEAKER_10]: the table or something.
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like that, but I'm the lead
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a serious business.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will send you the fuck home if
you're playing with your phone,
[SPEAKER_12]: if you're standing over there in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take a couple of pictures.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a huge garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take a couple of pictures.
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand, but take your pictures right
before, right after your shift.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do them and walk in and take them
or finish up, take them.
[SPEAKER_12]: But don't pull out your phone every 20
minutes to take a picture.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't text your girlfriend all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just do some shit while you're in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't just be walking around smelling
plants and sniffing your fingers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's work to be done.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's 300 plants and 85 lights in one
room.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I called you over for a few hours of
work.
[SPEAKER_12]: I need you to work, not play with your
phone.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're in the industry, appreciate
your position.
[SPEAKER_12]: Start taking notes of everything you do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Document all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure you're getting paid a fair wage.
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of pay attention to the way that the
market in this industry is going and make
[SPEAKER_12]: sure that you are getting a competitive
wage and bring it to your employer's
[SPEAKER_12]: attention that you can now run an OB dose.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can now run a satellite.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure that all that shit is noticed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sure you're getting paid for what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're coming to join the industry,
I would say get a key badge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't even waste time with a support
badge.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're worth more money with the key
badge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go get that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll testify to that for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been going about a half hour.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you guys want to take some dabs?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Alan's never taken a dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you interested in taking a first dab
on a podcast?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still going to be an observer tonight.
[SPEAKER_12]: No peer pressure.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one offer.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to twist his arm,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to smoke some of this lemon G.
[SPEAKER_12]: I should ask a question to get you guys
going, but I didn't think of a good
[SPEAKER_12]: question yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: We already talked about.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you think of this whole
concentrate scene?
[SPEAKER_12]: Where did you come from?
[SPEAKER_12]: You're new here to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been up here a year in December.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you've come a long way in just a year.
[SPEAKER_12]: See, this guy's a go-getter.
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't sit on the couch and fuck around
when he got here.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I would encourage everyone
else out there that's going to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Treat it like it's a job.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly using a product that's
always been associated with good times.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want everybody to get the medicinal
help out of it that they need.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with the rec, people that just want to
use it for enjoyment that it brings us.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you're on the job, it's a job.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to make sure that all of those
other components work or it'll be a
[SPEAKER_10]: short-lived industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: The cash register has to come out right at
the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't do that if you're too high.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you think of this whole hash
scene and the way that we all just smoke a
[SPEAKER_12]: shit ton of hash here?
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it like that at all in Arizona or is
that just kind of a Colorado thing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't in the industry down there,
so I couldn't tell you how much people
[SPEAKER_10]: were, what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys enjoy it up here a lot.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think if I was going to get Allen to
smoke some hash right now, it'd probably
[SPEAKER_15]: have to be some bubble hash or some ice
hash or something like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got dry sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got bubble.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got crumble.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got 9,000 different kinds of hash
here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, Allen.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know the old school stuff?
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't peer pressure the guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh wait, I need the rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need the dabber with a dab on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No peer pressure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of a quiet guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I start... Him and our buddy
Ernie, he's come across as very
[SPEAKER_12]: well-spoken and very intelligent so far.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's let him continue that reputation on
the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: We won't turn him into a bubble or a
puddle.
[SPEAKER_12]: We won't do that to him on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to twist his arm here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm heating up the highly educated.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one's the duality mail.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I do have to say, I used to,
when I participated when it wasn't legal
[SPEAKER_10]: as a younger man, I had one of the old
hobbit bongs that I used to smoke my stuff
[SPEAKER_10]: through.
[SPEAKER_10]: Had a wonderful ex-wife.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now she's wonderful because she's an ex.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is the Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that what this is?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love you the glass where they have
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, to sit here, you don't have to
really smoke to appreciate the art or the
[SPEAKER_10]: craftsmanship in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is really... Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see why someone who asked the
budget may spend the money on one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Art is subjective, and it's not jumping
back to what we're talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I'm sitting here looking at what
you have on the table, I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's three beautiful pieces.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Two Hitman's and then a piece from
Elevate.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's so trippy how glass has
changed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when maybe the last 10 years,
I remember just going into the glass shop.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was kind of like, so, so, you know,
and then now this just seems like the
[SPEAKER_15]: glass shops have just exploded with all
the dab, the dab thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: All the dab scene and all that,
all the rigs.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's something about being a grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: I caught myself falling into it.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you harvest, you have too much money
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like any young guy that has too much
money and a big ego and shit going on,
[SPEAKER_12]: you got to go buy something.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't do the gold chains.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't do rims on my car.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the thing I like to do is smoke hash
and listen to good music.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've got a slamming stereo system.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got really good headphones on and I've
got really nice hash toys.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's every harvest.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would go buy something ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like this was one of my first good harvest
they hit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're talking about those,
like a harvest that I grew this one here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just drew some extra herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, I'm going to set up this room.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that extra room bought me that rig was
pretty much what I pulled out of their
[SPEAKER_12]: extra, you know?
[SPEAKER_12]: So stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to go buy a rig instead of
buying rims and gold chains and jerseys
[SPEAKER_12]: and Air Jordans.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you have gold chains and Air
Jordans are your thing, fucking rock them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd rather have a Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can come hit my rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll look stylish doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not worried about looking that
style.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like skate shoes and Dickies.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice and easy for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the new one that you got there?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is called the Hitman short stack.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the one we were hitting a little
earlier.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shout out again to Hitman Dougie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Ryan at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey Ryan, I got the rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was supposed to tell you when I got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot this.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's here, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot to send you that email,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of clogged up.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should clean it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something I could talk about.
[SPEAKER_12]: How to clean your rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a good chunk in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's probably a half gram of just bus
stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a very intricate piece to be trying
to... I'm going to have to dissolve it
[SPEAKER_12]: really well with rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_12]: So get you some 91% isopropyl alcohol and
just fill the rig up as high as you can
[SPEAKER_12]: with alcohol and let it sit for a few.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then pour a little bit of kosher salt
in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: The kosher salt's real rough and then
shake the shit out of the rig.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cover the holes with your thumbs and shake
the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't drop it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it over the carpet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it over the couch if you feel like
you're clumsy and just shake the fucking
[SPEAKER_12]: shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll scrub it up real good and then rinse
it with hot water a few times.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let it cool off and then you're ready to
dab again if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, one of the things I noticed is
if you give it a decent... Well,
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That piece is pretty intricate,
but I noticed that once when you're done,
[SPEAKER_15]: if you want to leave it nice and streak
free, you give it another rinse with the
[SPEAKER_15]: alcohol and let the alcohol dry on there.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't get a nice... Polish it up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Almost like the day you got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a super good tip right there for
all you glass nerds when you're done
[SPEAKER_12]: cleaning your rig.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Carlos got a lot of good tips for
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a sharp guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, he does.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now that you're comfortable with the
headphones and the mic, we'll have you
[SPEAKER_12]: back on for another show and I'll have
stuff written down for you because we'll
[SPEAKER_12]: talk about how you grow and stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how you grow, but we'll let you
teach the listeners.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, we've been going for 33 minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you got anything else that you want to
say to... I'm going to let you guys know
[SPEAKER_12]: now that the show is coming to an end.
[SPEAKER_12]: When this comes out, within 48 hours of
this episode being posted, 5,000 people
[SPEAKER_12]: will download and listen to this episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll come out on a Monday, by Tuesday at
midnight, 5,000 downloads.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people are going to hear all the
stuff you had to say today.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wait until the end of the show to tell
people how many people are going to hear
[SPEAKER_12]: them.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you got anything you want to say to
that many people, now is your chance.
[SPEAKER_12]: Microphone is on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't do shout outs for anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't have anybody to represent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Always encourage people to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you get out there and support
the people that are supporting this
[SPEAKER_10]: industry, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's a politician, make sure that they
have your interest at heart and get out
[SPEAKER_10]: there and support those guys doing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's very wise words.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank both of you guys for
coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a great show, you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good conversational show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey Rob, get well soon, man, because I
need you on the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to have Rob from Sour Seed on in
a very soon episode.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to talk about selecting males
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_12]: That should be a very fun episode to good
breeders.
[SPEAKER_12]: We may get Rusty from Canaventure.
[SPEAKER_12]: If he's available, he has to travel an
hour to get here, but if he can come,
[SPEAKER_12]: if we can all match up, we have three
well-known seed breeders here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys have questions about selecting
a male, email it to me, growfromyourheart
[SPEAKER_12]: .hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm digging for that paper that I read at
the end and it's, I don't know where it
[SPEAKER_12]: is, so we're just going to go like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remind me to ask him.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to select a male for some seed
breeding.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, not now, but I have to get
into that, get the wheel rolling in that
[SPEAKER_15]: direction.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe you guys can come hang out
when Rob's here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's cool.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So guys, I want to thank you for
listening.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be back in another week.
