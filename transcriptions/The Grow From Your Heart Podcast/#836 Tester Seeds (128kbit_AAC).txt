[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 836 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a great episode lined up for you
in today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about the free seeds later
on in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to start by inviting you to the
dude grows growers cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: June 1st in La Porte, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude grows crew is throwing the dude
grows growers cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude grows crew will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scotty real will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The iry army will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all cordially invite you to join us at
the dude grows growers cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check dgccup.com for all of
the information on the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, the next thing I want to talk
about is the 420 sale at iry direct.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420 is quickly approaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have already started the 420 sale at iry
direct.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check iry direct for the new
drop of April O'Neill and Baxter Stockman.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few packs left at the time of
this recording, so make sure you hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: website for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, every order over $100 does come with
a free two pack of cherry goat feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the cherry jelly cross to the
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving two of those with every order
over $100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you do check iry direct.com
for current inventory and sale pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing I want to talk about when
it comes to iry direct, you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you are putting your shipping address
in there, it gives you the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: put in your name and your address.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a spot for a company name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please you guys stop putting silly things
in that company name slot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that you're proud of your
company name.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're proud of your Instagram handle,
but putting that Rasta Jeff's manja farm
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, that does raise suspicions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without that on the package, nobody cared
what was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you put wildbills weed sanctuary,
everybody wants to know what's in that
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just not put those details in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're proud of your company name,
but it's highly unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure most of you watching listening
are not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to speak to a different audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys, please think about it when
you're putting that on your package.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mailman is going to read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mailwoman is going to read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person at the post office receiving
that is going to read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look at every package I hand them and
they scan them one at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look at the name, the address,
and they scan it and make sure it matches
[SPEAKER_01]: on a computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you put Rasta Jeff's pot farm or
ganja Larry's fucking ganja weed farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: they see that and they give me silly
looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I could easily delete it,
but sometimes we're in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't notice all that as we're printing
labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please stop putting that silly stuff on
the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does raise suspicions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if that's not a real company,
if that's not like a bonafide company that
[SPEAKER_01]: the mailman is aware of, or the postal
carrier is what I should say now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may not get that package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may get returned to me because it was
sent to a fake company that does not
[SPEAKER_01]: exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So help us help each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help me help you out when it comes to that
address line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put if it is not necessary,
please don't put a company name in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that ramble got as long as it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should not have been that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's jump into a this is
going to be a combination part of today's
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I cover something that we
call the pet peeve section of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know what a pet peeve is by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that just drives you crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that just bothers you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be just something that only bugs
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is your pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes in a grow room, I may see
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes at a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes in a smoke circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll get a question or hear a
story that is a pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a topic that drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to talk about pet peeves in the
podcast and cover my peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I like to answer emails that are
questions about cultivating cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our pet peeve is going to roll right into
the email portion of the podcast and you
[SPEAKER_01]: will quickly see why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this pet peeve did come to me on my
website at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that website, there is a tab that says
grow help or grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab, you are given
the opportunity to send me a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is how you can win free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to my website, iregenetics.com,
click on that grow help tab, send me a
[SPEAKER_01]: good grow question, a well thought out
question that will help you and other
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send that question to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this first message did come from that
grow help tab on iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person is going to remain anonymous
for this message, but here is their pet
[SPEAKER_01]: peeve and also our topic for today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says my pet peeve is someone charging
money for a pack of tester seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: then on top of that telling people what
they can and cannot do with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand where this is going and I've
got a good response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also says if you didn't want cuts given
out before you release the strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: then why would you charge people for the
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to testers being free to see
if they're worth growing or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why pay money to help people do your job?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then be told what we can and can't do with
my own property.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell you're fired up, but calm
down, bro, because I've got basic answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to be this aggro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pet peeve, charging money for a pack of
tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there's a lot of stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually got some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to combine my notes with your
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charging people for a pack of tester
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I charge for tester seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me back up and talk a little bit
about tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might not have any idea what
I'm talking about when it comes to tester
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me start with not only am I a
podcaster, I'm also a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the seed breeder and sole proprietor
of iReGenetics Premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all the selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little bit of help with some
packaging and some artwork and a few
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, but it is 99% me running
the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am iReGenetics Premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make orangegasm, lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make a lot of great strains out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put me on the spot, I can't even
think about them, but there are so many
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that I've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm known for the Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was real popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make these strains, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys love to grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm making new strains,
sometimes I get this idea of what if I put
[SPEAKER_01]: plant A and plant B together and breed
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make some cool new shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, hopefully my intuition and my
breeding intelligence and knowledge works
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can kind of predict the outcome of
this breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the two plants together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be really easy to put them online
and sell them, but that's kind of a dick
[SPEAKER_01]: move in my opinion because I don't know
what those seeds are gonna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be hopefully my breeding
intuition was accurate and I have made a
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing seeds that will produce amazing
progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also there's a chance there's always a
chance that maybe there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they just suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they don't germinate properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they don't grow well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they don't put off good aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's no buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we get the dreaded intersex plants
out of the batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have just made the most amazing
new shit or I could have just made garbage
[SPEAKER_01]: or some more in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to figure this out is by testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now first, I test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll run as many as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna say too many numbers because
I've got different locations and at some
[SPEAKER_01]: places I'm allowed more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some places I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's in my house, I do fucking six of
them because it's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm renting space some more in a
commercial facility or things that I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about contractually, then I'll do
more seeds and I'll have people help me
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I test them first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I've got a small group of friends
that you've heard me talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them want to be known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some want to remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give those people seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like testers that live near me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the seeds first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I'm into flower and I see if I've got
any problems right away or if I see that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy with what I'm getting,
I'll pass a few seeds to a few of my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that are close to the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once I see that they're having
success with that, by now I'm harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what the seeds are gonna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're about halfway through a
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I decide that it is time to
share those tester seeds with the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can grow those seeds and have a good
outcome, a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be able to grow every plant by
now and have a good outcome, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that I bred and created.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my rooms dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my feeding methods dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: My SOPs are under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have success with 95%,
99% of the plants that I attempt to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I get it right, that's not a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna find a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna see what the plant does in my
environment under my care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see the phenotypical
expression that happens in my environment
[SPEAKER_01]: or different environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very limited to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't run 20 different rooms to go see
what these plants are gonna do in 20
[SPEAKER_01]: different rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not feasible for me
logistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got my friends running them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I see what happens in their different
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends, he does straight up
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One guy does HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other guy does ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: One guy does hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other guy does soilless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just being hypothetical here so I
can go see those different variables and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look at their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smell their plants and see what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, so I'm tier one testing,
they're tier two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once I'm satisfied, I want to see
what happens in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and my crew, I'm not being
braggadocious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fucking professional growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be able to grow the shit out of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The testers can be anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be amateur growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be people dreaming about growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be their very first pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could also be professional commercial
cultivators like myself and my crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be growing indoors in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be growing in a closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be in a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be in a big 25 by 25 room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what they're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they running LEDs, gavitas,
metal halides, HPSs, ceramic metal
[SPEAKER_01]: halides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they using plasma lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they running under canopy lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they doing, like I said a minute ago,
soil, soilless mix, hydro, aeroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they in cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they just straight hanging the plants
in the air and misting them some magical
[SPEAKER_01]: way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Aeroponically, there are so many different
variables that I cannot create.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by putting the testers out in your
guys' hands, I can see what is happening
[SPEAKER_01]: with my new creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is why I send them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what testers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole idea is what are testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testers are new shit that have not been
verified or proven to be added to the
[SPEAKER_01]: official lineup of iRegenetics Premium
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what testers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are two questions, three
questions to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I sell them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I sell them because what I noticed
when I used to give them away,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give them away and nothing would
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would give me reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would ever say these plants were
fire or these plants were trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not get any return on the seeds
that I gave away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that selling seeds, the tester
seeds for a low price, people have more
[SPEAKER_01]: pride in something that they paid for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives them some initiative and some
motivation to put that plant in the dirt
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow it instead of just taking a
freebie seed and acting like they got a
[SPEAKER_01]: cool gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as much as I did love and do love
giving shit away, testers, I need them
[SPEAKER_01]: ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need them tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are testers, not keepers,
not souvenirs, not drawer decorations,
[SPEAKER_01]: not trinkets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please grow those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to scan your question here,
get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll scan my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charging money for a pack of tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then telling people what they can and
cannot do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand where this came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another listener said they wanted to give
clones of my new testers away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do whatever you want with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this goes for any clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I sent you a clone of anything,
if I told you it was Northern Lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I told you it's Golden Goat,
if I sent it to you, it is your
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility as a farmer, as a
cultivator, as a cannabis community
[SPEAKER_01]: member, as somebody that wants to forward
the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is your responsibility to grow that cut
and verify that it is worth passing to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it would be good etiquette
to just get that plant, cut clones of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and pass it right along.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be a verification step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't just say that with my tester
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like a general rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a courtesy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just being classy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you want, so let's just
hypothetically say, hey man, I just
[SPEAKER_01]: sprouted this seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to send you clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd lose contact with you,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk to you anymore just
because that's just how business goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plant is going to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I find, unfortunately,
that this plant I just sent you clones of
[SPEAKER_01]: is Intersects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably cut clones of that and
sent it to your friend who was probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, instead of improving cannabis,
I just accidentally spread an Intersects
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You possibly, I don't know your level of
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just estimating you possibly could be
a brand new grower that doesn't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to look for Intersects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to fuck up your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before you did that, you took a bunch
of cuts and sent them to five other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's five other people who are
spreading them and it goes exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intersects plants all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were my fault on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I say grow them out before
you pass any clones out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you're putting your word on that
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I bred it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I created that line, but you're the one
that selected that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your name is on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your selection reputation is on the line
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have aroma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it grow well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Intersects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it get powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it prone to spider mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your responsibility to learn that
at least one time before you share it and
[SPEAKER_01]: spread it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I said that it would be
common courtesy to not spread that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what you're getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You paid for something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always talk like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stop you from doing anything with
the seeds that I've sold you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also said this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be like me selling you a
motorcycle and telling you you can't go
[SPEAKER_01]: fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go fast, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But common courtesy would be to not share
clones that have been not been that have
[SPEAKER_01]: not been tested, verified, tried and true
and ran at least to fruition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why do you want to pass out some shit
that you haven't even tried yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, don't don't you want to know that
it's good or know that it's terrible
[SPEAKER_01]: before you share it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's that's what I would want to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to your message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to get cuts given out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you charge people?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do whatever you want,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just common courtesy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to testers being free?
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't care about free shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw this when I just talked about I
notice when I charge more for the seed for
[SPEAKER_01]: the testers, people buy them and then they
post their tester reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in a band, if we did a free
concert, nobody would come.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we charge three dollars, the backyard
would be full.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have more value in something they
had to pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just that that just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave them they gave money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want something in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's free, they're not attached to it
in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those seeds go in the drawer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They forget all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why pay money to help you do your job?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, bro, there I don't have every
single type of grow space equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't meant to be egotistical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love getting the tester seeds out to new
growers because they're going to fuck them
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to overfeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to underfeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to overwater underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to see what happens when they
face those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, some of those testers are bad
motherfuckers with photography and I want
[SPEAKER_01]: their photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those photos are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing what's happening with my plants all
over the world, getting those grow
[SPEAKER_01]: reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is great info.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to slide your message over
and I'm going to stick to my notes here
[SPEAKER_01]: because I do have some more notes to
ramble on about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I expect when I send you tester
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy tester seeds, I really expect
and hope that you grow them in a timely
[SPEAKER_01]: manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand you've got more crops going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're waiting for one crop to
finish, a room to be empty, a tent to be
[SPEAKER_01]: free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But please grow them so that we can get
those test reports going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can find out if they're really good
or not amazing or where they fall on that
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we know if we put them out for sale
to the general public or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow them to the best of your ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I do recommend, and these are
your seeds, you can do what you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but keep in mind they're testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're testing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not verified that these are
amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want something to put in a big pot
and grow huge, buy something from the
[SPEAKER_01]: proven line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But testers, they could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg them for a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg them until you can get a clone or two
off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then flower them is my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if they're amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would you veg them out super big?
[SPEAKER_01]: And waste a bunch of time, space,
energy, resources, lights, soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: water, nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why would you waste all that on a
tester if you don't even know that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be hot fire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely they will be if they're coming
from me because I've done my pre due
[SPEAKER_01]: diligence, but they're testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say run them small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three gallon pot is big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg them till they're about knee high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What also I would like to see is if you
could, and I understand this is this is
[SPEAKER_01]: not always possible, but what I do with
the tester if I've got six feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, they all get treated the exact
same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do anything different to anyone
because then my test is invalid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if I run six of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also kind of how I do a phenol
hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm running six plants, I feed them all
six the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them all six the same treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they react?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I see out of those six?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I want to do the testing
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you do all the time to these
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your SOP so that we could see how they
respond to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my man expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Etiquette is my next thing I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do what you want, but I wouldn't
give out clones until you flower them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is part of the etiquette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then please do keep in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the expectation I would
like in the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot to show me, but if you
notice something that stands out,
[SPEAKER_01]: email me as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contact me if you can take pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say this is what is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know that shit excites me and
interests me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things I want to know are how many
seeds did you try to germinate?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many germinated?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all on my website also,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys under the tester tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what's going on with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many you germinated?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many sprouted of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many made it to the flower room?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any mutations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any weirdos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any problems or anything amazing that you
stood out?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to flower, I would hope for
weekly photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe at the start of week one,
the start of week two, and then right
[SPEAKER_01]: before you harvest, take some pictures and
let me know what they look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at the end, I would appreciate a
smoke report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what it did for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how much you harvested out of
how much space, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would hope for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand all those things aren't
always possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of people are going to say,
how do I send you these photos?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I send you my reports?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I give you this information?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very easy to access.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is iregeneticsathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send me all your pictures,
your grow reports there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do that, put the word grow report
or tester report in the subject line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it easier to find that for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm scrolling through or searching,
pops up much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way to send me those photos is
through the website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send pictures through that grow
help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and send me photos there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I would appreciate it and love it if
you join us on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link in the show notes in the
video description to get to the Discord
[SPEAKER_01]: server.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scroll around in the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left, you will see a tab that says
iregenetics testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when you post the pictures in
the tester tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great testers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can go and look and see the
progress other people are making.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can share your progress, get feedback
from other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go in occasionally and look at every
single tester picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I capture all of them, put them in a
folder so that I've got all the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: documented so that when I want to post
stuff online or talk about things,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got photos for references.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Discord is one of my favorite ways
to see the photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a very communal way to come hang
out and join the community, join the iRE
[SPEAKER_01]: Army.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you're there, jump in the
growers' lounge, the smokers' lounge,
[SPEAKER_01]: and hang out on the chat with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll answer your grow questions there on
the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got three ways so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send them on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can join the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I ask for you guys is when
the grow is completed, once you've
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested, you've smoked it, on
iregenetics.com, there is a tab that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually says testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you click on that tab, a big old list
of questions comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Answer those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also type in any details and info that you
may think would be valuable to me as the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and the person selling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if you saw amazing colors,
if it smelled like something brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got higher than you ever been,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if it totally sucked, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me that grow report.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is on the website at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a full tester report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I send out these tester seeds,
it does come with a little card with most
[SPEAKER_01]: of that info on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this was overwhelming, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this info does come on a little card
so that you can refer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got my email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to the Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a QR code that should take you
right to the Discord on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that little card that comes with
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to review my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I sell them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you guys respect them more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I expect from them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow them right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think and then fill
out a grow report at iregenetics.com at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to run them all the same if you
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love a lot of photos, as many
photos as you can send me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say you cannot send me too many
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's a bad idea to say that,
but load me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love tester photos, especially you great
photographers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something I was going to come
down to at the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite growers and photographers do
give it free tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm looking for somebody to grow some
shit, I got some brand new shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few people that I call up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Marco Esquandolis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure who else wants their name
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nehe is also one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few of you guys out there that
do a great job with the testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm leaving people out just by
saying a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You testers know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the favorites will get free
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So send me those grow test pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I love your photos, I may send you
free seeds to grow test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, just because they look really good
on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps us both out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could share clones if you'd like to,
but I'd rather you didn't share them until
[SPEAKER_01]: you're finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is basic etiquette with all the
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, that is my new
tester update episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments or concerns, you know that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would love to hear from you.

your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love constructive criticism,
positive feedback, and also I can take
[SPEAKER_01]: some hate mail if that's what you feel the
need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my friend that sent me this email,
I have got your email address.
