don't know caribou heart TV I apologize
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going fast here check out caribou
heart TV on the YouTube thanks guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed being on there something else I
want to talk about I have noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: online there are a few websites selling I
read genetic seeds miss Jill seeds other
[SPEAKER_00]: brand seeds and we have never done
business with those companies when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: buying seeds I highly recommend that you
are very careful where you spend your
[SPEAKER_00]: money do a little bit of research most of
the reputable popular breeders right now
[SPEAKER_00]: have our own websites their own websites
you can go to I read genetics.com you can
[SPEAKER_00]: look on a vendor list on that list of
vendors there are seven vendors listed you
[SPEAKER_00]: can click on a link it goes directly to
their website if the web guy did it right
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes right to my tab on the website I
haven't gotten to check every link but
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to my web guy you do a great job
bro but click on the link it'll take you
[SPEAKER_00]: to the website where those seeds are
available those are the preferred and
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended and trusted vendors on my
website I put them up there because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done a lot of business with them I trust
them I know they are reliable there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of new vendors that have not been
added to the website yet it takes me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to vet them I get them seeds
they get going I make sure they're cool I
[SPEAKER_00]: do a little bit of recon maybe I order
seeds from them and they don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: it was me or maybe I have a friend order
seeds and we just make sure the seeds come
[SPEAKER_00]: in a timely manner that they're packaged
appropriately I inspect them make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't fuck with the packages that I
send I do check on that sort of stuff once
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that the companies are legit
they're doing a good job then we add them
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the website if you ever have a
question about somebody selling irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics beans please contact me say is
this a legit vendor of irie seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I haven't added them to the website
right away maybe they're new maybe they're
[SPEAKER_00]: an auction house doing an auction
somewhere with social media they've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: change their names their social media
quite often we do have to keep up with
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that but my advice you guys if
you're and I'm not saying just buy irie
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if you're gonna buy irie seeds miss
Jill seeds if you're gonna buy jinx proof
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds whatever brand you were looking at
buying do some research before you spend
[SPEAKER_00]: your money there are a lot of companies
out there they just want your money they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care and now they're taking crypto
cryptocurrency and once you pay in crypto
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no recourse if they steal your
crypto your crypto is gone there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service there's no middleman so
you've got to be extra careful now crypto
[SPEAKER_00]: is amazing the future is awesome the
internet is great but also it can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge trap it's opened up a lot of doors
for a lot of shitty people a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you do get seeds sometimes you
don't even get seeds from some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors but if they're claiming that
they're selling irie seeds and I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned them maybe just send us an email
say hey irie genetics is this really a
[SPEAKER_00]: vendor that we can trust and I'll tell you
yes or no and then you can go to social
[SPEAKER_00]: media and you can say hey Rasta Jeff
approved this vendor we can buy stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: them you can share that with your friends
and let everybody know for me but yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: check online before you buy stuff guys if
it's gonna be my seeds if it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody seeds please just send us an email
make sure but I did I did say there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of new vendors out there that I
have not added to the website yet they
[SPEAKER_00]: will go up pretty soon I've got to pass
the info to the web guy he's got to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to approve them first of all is
the main thing here so be very careful
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're buying seeds buy from a
reputable vendor what some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing they just take your money and they
say thank you and the cool thing about a
[SPEAKER_00]: website is I can print customer reviews
and make it look like part of my website
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can say like Rasta Jeff donated ten
million dollars to our charity he came
[SPEAKER_00]: here and fucking healed the sick he
touched little kids and they walked they
[SPEAKER_00]: were in wheelchairs for their whole lives
there were fucking people with AIDS and
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer and he blew kisses at them and they
danced in the streets and they're healed I
[SPEAKER_00]: could put that on my website I could make
a customer review that looks like that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened the internet is really easy to
manipulate so you go to a website and you
[SPEAKER_00]: see a thousand good reviews great shipping
good product amazing outcome and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sold you know what I mean but then you buy
the shit and the shit either doesn't show
[SPEAKER_00]: up or what does often happen so that these
people can keep taking your money they do
[SPEAKER_00]: send you seeds but it is nothing like what
you expected it to be it is not my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the stuff I bred I never touched
it I don't know what it is they never did
[SPEAKER_00]: any business with me they don't even have
my stuff but they're saying these are I
[SPEAKER_00]: recede so you buy a package and it's just
random seeds that they got from whoever
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever they could have bred them in
their backyard they could have bought them
[SPEAKER_00]: from a breeder in another country their
cousin could be doing it but the point is
[SPEAKER_00]: that those are not the genetics you paid
for you got seeds but you don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: pedigree you don't know the lineage you
don't know the heritage you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get you when you saw the arise or
strawberry starburst on the website you
[SPEAKER_00]: went I want that for a specific reason a
lot of people do a lot of research before
[SPEAKER_00]: they pull to pull the trigger on a pack of
seeds money's expensive seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and I try you guys I know I'm
rambling now but I try really hard to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: my seeds affordable I have to be
competitive with the market and stay at
[SPEAKER_00]: market rate but I'm a little bit lower
than most of the the big dogs because grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart breed with love where I'm
trying to get the seeds out to the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have a lot of money you don't
need to be rich to be a grower I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to have a lot of money to be able
to get into this club I want everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: growing so I try to keep my seeds
affordable I often wonder if when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: scrolling through when you see like I'm
not even gonna say the breeder but some
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders have seeds listed at like three
and five and six hundred dollars on
[SPEAKER_00]: websites and then you scroll down and you
see mine they're about 80 bucks on most
[SPEAKER_00]: websites 80 90 dollars depending on what
shipping is and all that good stuff it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about 80 or 90 bucks for a 10 pack of my
seeds which I think is very very
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable when you look around a lot of
them are 120 130 and then you see those
[SPEAKER_00]: three hundred and five hundred dollar
packs I wonder if that almost D values my
[SPEAKER_00]: product and people say well that's cheap
shit because it's cheap shit but honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because I don't need to get rich and
I'm trying to get the seeds out that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal is to get good seeds in the hands
of good people and good people aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: always rich people but be careful you guys
when you're spending your money be careful
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want you to get what you think
you're paying for you've done all this
[SPEAKER_00]: research you've fucking watched seven
episodes on a rise you've heard me talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about a rise for five years now and you're
like I need some a rise and then you go
[SPEAKER_00]: order it and you get it from some company
that's never been heard of and you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and they're all white and they're
not even the right shape and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: they do grow they grow all crooked and
shitty and they're not what you thought
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you send me a message going hey
these are I see it's fucking suck and I
[SPEAKER_00]: say where did you buy them and then you
tell me some random website called this
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like I've never heard of them so
you don't have my seeds I apologize that
[SPEAKER_00]: that happened to you please do better
research so my advice here you guys my
[SPEAKER_00]: ramble the the short version of this is
check my website check whoever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying seeds from check their website for
a list of reputable vendors then when you
[SPEAKER_00]: do find a reputable reputable vendor do
some research on them the social media is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing for this sort of stuff Pinterest
is amazing for this sort of stuff discord
[SPEAKER_00]: is amazing for this sort of stuff I'll
give you advice on other breeders like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for somewhere to get any
other breeder I don't even care who you
[SPEAKER_00]: ask me if you can't find them and I know
where it's available I'll tell you where
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it I don't find any competition
between other breeders I don't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why maybe let's just say I make
vanilla cake right I'm the pro at making
[SPEAKER_00]: vanilla cake if you want chocolate I have
no problem telling you where to get
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate cake because when you want
vanilla you're gonna come get vanilla cake
[SPEAKER_00]: from me all day and I'm no problem sharing
sources and resources and all that good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff all right I got stoner and I got
fucking rambly that is a good way to segue
[SPEAKER_00]: into the next topic of this podcast you
guys um I smoked some rosin earlier today
[SPEAKER_00]: from 14 or and it was some papaya cake and
I'm not usually a rosin smoker you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: hear me talk about smoking green dot
batter green dot diamonds all the time my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite local dispensary has made some
changes and there are also rule changes
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up here in Colorado so things are
changing with availability of concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stores um which why you heard in a
previous episode I was smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates made by a friend a local
person who made some stuff themselves I
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer I just prefer good concentrates I
don't even care if it came from a person
[SPEAKER_00]: or a store I prefer good clean safe
concentrates but I think I prefer a batter
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've been shopping and buying
different things just because it's there
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can't get what I want sometimes I
hit this 14 or batter and the change up
[SPEAKER_00]: was changing up from what I'm usually used
to smoking to go into this batter it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a whole new buzz it kicked my ass it
may have put me down into the couch and
[SPEAKER_00]: made me take a little bit of a nappy poo
on the couch for a couple of minutes so
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out to 14 or I think there's
called 14 or extracts or 14 or the papaya
[SPEAKER_00]: cake I said that really weird papaya cake
put me on my ass for a few minutes had to
[SPEAKER_00]: regroup I had to get my shit together but
what that wanted me to talk about what
[SPEAKER_00]: that got me want to talk about was do you
have crazy dreams when you smoke like if I
[SPEAKER_00]: take a dab and I'm like oh I'm gonna lay
on the couch after that one and doze off
[SPEAKER_00]: for a minute that little short nap that I
take I can go on the most amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: adventures in my dreams the most amazing
vivid dreams I I see people that are in my
[SPEAKER_00]: life and we have deep conversations about
shit we solve world hunger we build towers
[SPEAKER_00]: we build lasers we go to other planets
sometimes I wake up and I have to like
[SPEAKER_00]: Google shit like did this happen because I
had a really intense dream that fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: like California slipped off the fucking
earth and fell into the ocean and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: sending drones out there to rescue people
and sharks are eating people and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the kind of shit that I'll dream
about and it will be vivid but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time a lot of time this is fucking weird I
dream that I'm late for a concert a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times it is a fill in friends or fish
concert and my buddy Robbie and I what's
[SPEAKER_00]: up Robbie the dude I hope you're watching
we will I'll be dreaming and I'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: drive to get to Rob and then when I get to
Rob I'm like cool I'm gonna get Rob and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're driving to the music but it always
ends up I get Rob and we're driving and we
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the place Rob's like take a left
bro take a right because Rob used to be my
[SPEAKER_00]: navigator on road trips before we had all
this technology Rob would be like take a
[SPEAKER_00]: right bro take a left he'd have the map in
his hands and shit and then we get some
[SPEAKER_00]: are and I'd be like bro there's no concert
here and he's like no bro this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: airport where the plane is to get us to
the other island to get us to the boat to
[SPEAKER_00]: get us to the concert and I'm like mother
like we only have an hour to do all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this I don't know why my dreams are so
stressful you guys but I'll dream that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna miss this damn fish show and it's
just it's always with Robbie and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always because it's really crazy and then
we show up and I dreamt one time that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was nobody else at the fish show
because nobody else realized you had to go
[SPEAKER_00]: from the airport to the island to the bus
to the fucking little boat to this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to the fucking little puddle jumper to the
hovercraft to the fucking walkway and me
[SPEAKER_00]: and Robbie were the only ones at the fish
show and we got to call out songs all
[SPEAKER_00]: night that was kind of cool but those are
the kind of fucking dreams I will have if
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke some good concentrates and then
fall asleep I had some crazy dreams on the
[SPEAKER_00]: couch today bro just wonder if you guys
have crazy dreams send me some feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: post it on the patreon post it on the
Twitter there is a Twitter it's at GF YH
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast post it up on the social media
send me an email grow from your heart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com do you dream some of my
friends say that when they smoke they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't dream at all which I find man that I
would that just be such a bummer I love
[SPEAKER_00]: the crazy crazy dreams all right I'm
stoned and rambling I did say that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: some emails let's get into that part of
the show you guys this one came from this
[SPEAKER_00]: one came from the I read genetics website
I read genetics.com on that website there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a grow help tab if you click on the
grow help tab it takes you to the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help section we do ask you about ten
preliminary questions things like what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your name what name should we use on the
podcast what strain are you growing basic
[SPEAKER_00]: questions we don't ask you anything too
invasive this helps me help you if I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of information I know what's
going on in your grow this is just like
[SPEAKER_00]: checking your pulse checking your
temperature making sure that you're alive
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a little bit of a little waiting
room a little check in stuff here but
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway this came from the website the grow
help tab you answer those quick few
[SPEAKER_00]: questions then at the bottom there's an
opportunity to type in and tell me what
[SPEAKER_00]: your problem is and then I do my best to
help you so let's jump right into it this
[SPEAKER_00]: one came from it says name to use on the
podcast our dog what up our dog thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for the message their strain they're
growing is magic melon they're growing it
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors they're growing under the sun the
plants are in veg they're in soil we do
[SPEAKER_00]: ask about the feeding and stuff but that
doesn't matter for this question I already
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's going on here so we've got
some plants outdoor we're growing magic
[SPEAKER_00]: melon I've never heard of magic melon that
sounds pretty nice magic is always good in
[SPEAKER_00]: a strain name get your fucking high get
your buzzed and melon who doesn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: melon flavored products I'm way off topic
let's get back to it I have one plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: I put outside all right we got a plant
outside it started flowering that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense I'm thinking it may have been from
not up potting it soon enough but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know plants get confused when we take them
from HID lighting on a schedule that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking solid solid schedule and the same
thing every day and then we put them
[SPEAKER_00]: outside in nature they got a little bit of
a change they're experiencing far-red and
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome experiences they've never had
before plants kind of trip out when you
[SPEAKER_00]: put them outside if it's not the right
time if they aren't timed just right and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an outdoor grower with a lot of
experience who could teach you more about
[SPEAKER_00]: that Jesse is the guy to talk to you there
so you got to time it right or they will
[SPEAKER_00]: go into flower and then they will go back
into veg which is what I think is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen here it says I up potted to a three
gallon from a one gallon I let her get
[SPEAKER_00]: settled in and I decided to pollinate with
some pollen I collected from a male so
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a plant that's outside it
started to flower it got pollinated with
[SPEAKER_00]: some pollen that makes totally good sense
so far it says here we are about two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: later and she looks like she is revegging
yeah the season right now the plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: revege they'll start revegging for you
it'll go kind of crazy it'll get bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll go grow stronger and longer and then
it's gonna flower here I think August
[SPEAKER_00]: right August I don't even remember dude
Jesse taught me but I'm an indoor guy so
[SPEAKER_00]: don't pay too much attention to this
anyway the question is will she make seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: the short answer is yeah all of those
pollination sites all of those the pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: they were pollinated if you have got a
pollinated ovule on that seed has begun
[SPEAKER_00]: yes it will make seeds the plant has
shifted all of its shifting gears now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pregnant I'm protecting my babies I'm
making big healthy strong babies my
[SPEAKER_00]: defenses are a little bit different
shifting gear so yes it is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to make seeds your plant will go
back into veg and then it will continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: make say seeds while it's vegging then
it'll go into flower and continue to make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds while it's flowering so you may get
some lower parts that are seeded and then
[SPEAKER_00]: as the plant goes into veg and grows more
it'll grow more new growth and then it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go into flower and you may have new buds
that aren't even seeded or you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy revege I don't know how hard your
plant is going to revege I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics I don't know this is gonna be
very plant plant specific very much so I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk about something else this is
what I do when I'm breeding indoors I talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this a lot and people think I'm
crazy I've said it a few times on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: and people always send me messages they're
like is that really what you meant to say
[SPEAKER_00]: to where I have to type the numbers 18 6
in the titles of the episode so that
[SPEAKER_00]: people really believe me that that's what
I'm talking about here's what I do when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breeding seeds the seeds that you guys
are purchasing the seeds that come from
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds here now calm from heritage seed
bank from Golden Ticket seeds from El
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuego seeds from shy town seeds I know I'm
missing somebody but I love you guys all
[SPEAKER_00]: equally those seeds that you are
purchasing those are made with this method
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinate the plants naturally normally
like we normally do it I get the male into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower I get the females into flower some
females want to get pollinated around day
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 somewhat pollen around day 32 I stagger
the female plants in the room I get the
[SPEAKER_00]: male pollinating to where he's really
dumping a lot of pollen busting a big load
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's the right time drag the boy over
to the girls put him right in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of the girls give him a good shake then I
wait three to five days then I give him
[SPEAKER_00]: another good shake at this point I'm done
with the male plant so I will cut him down
[SPEAKER_00]: and honestly I beat him against the
fucking ceiling so that all that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: rains down all over the plant sometimes
I'll smack him against the fan it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: funny when the fan is spinning and you
smack a male plant against the fan pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: just goes fucking everywhere it is
disgusting you taste it it gets in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hair it gets in your dreads you really got
to clean that shit up unless you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: savage breeder I wouldn't really recommend
doing that but it is for a breeder that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to do it so take the dude over
there smack him get that pollen everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: the girls are now they've been double
pollinated they've taken two loads of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen I'm sure that every pistol in that
fucking room has received pollen there is
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen everywhere I'm tasting it it's in
my teeth I got this this gritty taste in
[SPEAKER_00]: my teeth the camera feels dusty if I'm
holding the camera it is funky in there so
[SPEAKER_00]: we have achieved successful pollination at
this point I'll wait three maybe five days
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes a little bit longer I want to
watch the pistols curl up and I want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that that that those girls are
pregnant I want to make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination has taken place once I see the
when you plants get pollinated the pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: will start to wither up and turn brown
that's why I always say pistols are never
[SPEAKER_00]: a guide or a determining factor to help
you determine ripeness the pistols can get
[SPEAKER_00]: withered up from getting touched getting
sprayed getting pollinated getting too hot
[SPEAKER_00]: too cold too moist too dry those will
wither up so don't ever let those trick
[SPEAKER_00]: you into thinking the plants ready because
they've done something could simply have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated plant a spider could have
crawled across there you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: touched it anything could have fucked that
up too hot too cold too dry wind all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff anyway after pollination those
pistols will weather they'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: shrinking in turn it brown change in shape
then within a few days you'll just start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing something different look in the
buds don't look like they normally do
[SPEAKER_00]: normally where you've got a calyx forming
it looks a little bit harder it's got like
[SPEAKER_00]: something going on it it's a seed in there
that's what that is the seed is forming
[SPEAKER_00]: once I see that seed you might think I'm
crazy but I switch my lights back to 18
[SPEAKER_00]: hours on and six hours off that's a 24
hour light cycle of 18 on and six off why
[SPEAKER_00]: would I do that my goal is no longer to
produce a big fat bud that's coated in
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes and it's gonna get all trimmed
up and be pretty and posted in a magazine
[SPEAKER_00]: and then get smoked this bud is loaded
with seeds I'm going to cut this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: down and grind it up with gloves on I'm
just gonna grind it up over a bowl and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna drop seed it's just gonna be
dust all of that plant material is going
[SPEAKER_00]: into a compost pile or a bokashi bucket
that is not going to be used as smokeable
[SPEAKER_00]: consumable flower in any way it is all
being grown for seed so if you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: for just seed at this point flip that
bitch to 18 six now we are getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: light energy per day in my opinion I think
light is the number one most useful
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient whatever you want to call it the
source of life energy for that plant light
[SPEAKER_00]: is what it wants more than anything so you
give it more light that gives the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: more energy that gives it more time per
day to build healthy babies it's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more light it's doing photosynthesis it's
saying hey I got all this light to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with it's gonna be a long day I can work
out all day I'm out here it's lifting
[SPEAKER_00]: weights or it's in the garden or whatever
you do that keeps you healthy it's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that all day long it's got six more hours
to do it than the plants that are only
[SPEAKER_00]: getting 1212 what I find by leaving the
lights on for the extra six hours my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are harder and thicker and fatter and
prettier and healthier and a more
[SPEAKER_00]: successful germination rate and more
vigorous plants than the plants that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving under a 1212 flowering cycle
something I have also noticed is these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants these seeds finish a little bit
earlier sometimes it'll take 10 weeks 11
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks for a seed to get good and hard when
I'm doing it in this method they're done
[SPEAKER_00]: in eight weeks maybe nine but it's quicker
it's 10 to 14 days quicker most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time sometimes a little bit longer
depending on the cultivar some plants just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to take a long time to make seeds
some really just want to take forever some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them will spit out seeds in no time
it's really amazing and really just
[SPEAKER_00]: watching different plants do this when I
breed to the Platinum Tangi that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun kiss comes from the orangegasm
comes from that one wants pollen really
[SPEAKER_00]: early and when she gets hit with that
pollen those seeds are done before
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else so I could take her down
early the strawberry starburst on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other hand which is what makes the
strawberry fields and other stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be released here in the future we'll
talk about that soon that one she wants
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen closer to day 30 so the sun kiss or
the Platinum Tangi wants pollen like day
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 25 strawberry fields wants the pollen
around day 30 27 day 32 in that range is
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's best to pollinate her for
maximum pollination I can hit her early
[SPEAKER_00]: but she's not gonna make as many seeds as
she would if I waited and gave her time to
[SPEAKER_00]: make more fuzz that little the hairs the
pistols the more of those the more seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to make so give her a little bit
longer but that by then that fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum Tangi plants almost done the
seeds are already getting formed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I haven't even pollinated the other
plant yet I have because I stagger the
[SPEAKER_00]: start times honestly but that's that
plants gonna take ten weeks for those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to get ready the other one's gonna
take seven so that's why sometimes things
[SPEAKER_00]: are sold out that's why things are
staggered but that is mainly why I do the
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 six because it makes my seeds finish a
little bit more quickly I think they are
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger harder bigger faster I have more
successful seeds if you're a breeder and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've made a whole room of seeds you'll
notice that you get a portion of your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are those white unusable seeds
excuse me some of your seeds are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: make are gonna be throwaway seeds you just
got to toss them or keep them for yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow them don't share them don't sell
them because people freak out when you
[SPEAKER_00]: give them those ugly white seeds I get
less of those when I do the 18 six method
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that I just have more successful
seeds in the batch also this is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: sales pitch for Canon LEDs in my
experience I'm getting better seeds under
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs I'm getting better seeds under LEDs
running them on 18 six that is the magic
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking formula in my opinion for making
seeds it's what I've had the most success
[SPEAKER_00]: with LEDs on 18 six after pollination so
the question here they got all this
[SPEAKER_00]: started was is this gonna work yes this is
gonna work for you you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and your plants will revenge for a
little bit and they'll go back into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll have seeds if you're doing this
indoors though you can you're leaving them
[SPEAKER_00]: on 18 six indefinitely they don't go back
into flower what will begin to happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have a plant that is filled with
seeds and the top buds of the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: start making revenge shoots if you leave
them long enough they'll revenge and make
[SPEAKER_00]: full-on clones out of the top of these
flowered plants that have seeds you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to go in there and cut
clones off of those plants if you did not
[SPEAKER_00]: save your genetics now is your time you've
got these genetics again you can rescue
[SPEAKER_00]: them right now another thing I do that
people think is crazy I do this to plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not seeded this is for my usable
smokable consumable product this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing with finished product flowers
that I intend to smoke myself or with Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: or with patients or however it ends up
this is what I really do the last 14 maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days depending on the strain in the
room and the needs of the room I do put my
[SPEAKER_00]: lights back on 18 six for my flowering
plants I do this for the same reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the seeded plants I feel that light
is the number one source of light and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy for our plants you got lights air
water and soil there's not a lot to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about lights I think are number one so I
put the lights back on 18 six for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days maybe the last 14 days and I
noticed the plants get bigger fatter
[SPEAKER_00]: beefier bulkier they just bulk up that
extra light energy gives them more energy
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow to bulk up to beef up and that's
what we want right at the end now people
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna say you're putting my flowering
plants on 18 six from 1212 that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up my crop my plants are going to go
back into a vegetative stage yes if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't cut them down in 10 to 14 days they
will go back into veg but we're looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest here in 10 to 14 days anyway
that's not gonna happen that's you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: time for that to happen you're gonna cut
them down before that so you've got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this with a plant with a cultivar you are
experienced in growing something you know
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant takes 64 days do it to a plant
that you know then at day 50 flip that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking timer back to 18 six you may be
able to cut that plant down instead of 64
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be cutting it down at day 60 so
when you start flushing flip that timer
[SPEAKER_00]: back to 18 six pay very close attention to
your trichomes and pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: tips of the tops of the buds at the very
top of the plant if the plant should
[SPEAKER_00]: decide to go back into veg it will happen
at the very tip top of the very top bud on
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant and you'll see it it'll just
look different it'll look like the bud and
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud and then there'll be just a little
thing coming out of the top harvest now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's starting to revedge it's not a big
deal if it starts but take note it fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 days into 18 six it was time you just
cut two days off your harvest time if you
[SPEAKER_00]: make note of that you can cut two more off
next time before that little nub happens
[SPEAKER_00]: you just cut four days off of your cycle
and the plants are going to be bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: fatter and beefier now here's another
thing that this benefits if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to revedge your plants if you did
not get a clone of this plant you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: it on 18 six for the last two weeks of
flower harvest most of the plant when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done leave a couple nugs at the
bottom and those are already revedging
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been in 18 six for two weeks now
the hormones have already switched over
[SPEAKER_00]: your two weeks ahead of yourself on your
revedge you just got to wait a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of time now now that you cut the rest of
that plant off and all the energy is not
[SPEAKER_00]: moving around the hormones aren't like i'm
in flower up here i'm in veg over here the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's gonna say he took off all my
flowers i've just got these little flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: here to deal with i got a big root zone
and i'm on 18 six he wants me to veg watch
[SPEAKER_00]: this kapow and it will veg really quickly
that way on you so carefully pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to your plants you can put them on 18 six
at the end of flower for 10 to 14 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: in my experience not my opinion in my
experience they will get beefier fatter
[SPEAKER_00]: chunkier you'll have a fatter weight
you'll have more bud and they'll probably
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit more dense so 18 six is a
good thing toward the end if you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds 18 six is good a little bit after
pollination get a lot of messages about
[SPEAKER_00]: that i mean it it's real it helps you with
a lot of things it also sets you up for
[SPEAKER_00]: that revedge so if you're trying to
revedge you can pollinate a room and then
[SPEAKER_00]: get seeds out of it and then pull clones
off of it and have a mother plant to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: again or you can grow your plants and
harvest them and i said harvest i got one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those hard agents again you can harvest
the plants and then you got clones coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up that you can revedge make a mother
plant out of don't be afraid to experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys don't be afraid to experiment i
do understand these plants are precious
[SPEAKER_00]: you're learning a lot you're growing a lot
they may be paying the bills they're
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping you medically supplied but don't
be afraid to try some experiments i do
[SPEAKER_00]: think that this 18 six idea that i
switched to was a really good idea it's
[SPEAKER_00]: helping me out all right i think that is
all i'm going to give you for this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: because the next email that i've got
deserves a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to be a long one seven
tenors i want to thank all of you for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to another episode of the grow
from your heart podcast 650 episodes dude
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit i had no idea it was going to go
this far uh we're chilling at maddie and
[SPEAKER_00]: spence's and people kept asking me the
same grow question and i said i should
[SPEAKER_00]: record this and when people ask me the
same damn question i should just hit play
[SPEAKER_00]: on my phone and let it go and then i
thought or you could do a podcast and just
[SPEAKER_00]: help all kinds of people since everybody's
asking the same question there's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of people out there with that
question too started off with a really
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty sound and audio show and now here
we are bro 4k hd 650 episodes uh 7 000
[SPEAKER_00]: youtube subscribers 225 patreon supporters
thank you guys i really do appreciate it
[SPEAKER_00]: this is amazing to me that this uh this
little idea stoned idea ended up being a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking fruitful successful business that
helps thousands of people that that means
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot to me thank you i do appreciate it
um i was rambling today shout out to 14 or
[SPEAKER_00]: for the uh papaya cake live ros and then
shit got me going uh after a little nap i
[SPEAKER_00]: look forward to all the emails corrections
uh comments concerns responses to this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode the email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com don't be shy
[SPEAKER_00]: send me some love send me some hate don't
worry about my ego i'm cool we can handle
[SPEAKER_00]: this at this point um also make sure you
check out the website i read genetics.com
[SPEAKER_00]: i talked about the list of trusted vendors
there's a grow help tab on there there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: link to the irie genetics web store
there's also a spot to sign up for the
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetics newsletter that's right it
says keep in touch or stay up to date if
[SPEAKER_00]: you type in your email address it will add
you to the mailing list approximately once
[SPEAKER_00]: a month i send out a newsletter in that
newsletter there are coupon codes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors there are links to new vendors
there are there's always a coupon code to
[SPEAKER_00]: my etsy store i change the coupon code
once a month so that people uh can't just
[SPEAKER_00]: keep using the same damn coupon code but
we'll give you some deals on the etsy
[SPEAKER_00]: store sometimes one item is on sale
sometimes every item is on sale you never
[SPEAKER_00]: know what i might do on the etsy shop my
advice to you is sign up for the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter you can stay up to date it's uh
on the website i read genetics.com type in
[SPEAKER_00]: your email address it will send you uh
just links it right up for me then when i
[SPEAKER_00]: send out the mail chimp you will get the
notification that was a mouthful to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: say also if you feel like the show is
educational informative or entertaining uh
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you'd like to throw us a couple of
bucks because i made you laugh maybe i
[SPEAKER_00]: rescued your plants all you have to do is

[SPEAKER_00]: like this but money's expensive right now
we're in a pandemic a lot of people lost
[SPEAKER_00]: their jobs a lot of people have fucking
fucked up situations and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing to spend their hard-earned money
on a podcast thank you i really really do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that i don't know how else to
express it uh i'm going to uh i'm going to
