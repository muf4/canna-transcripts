[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a great episode lined up for

[SPEAKER_11]: Jesse is back to give us another outdoor
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to read a little bit of news
before we get to that so let's get down to
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, this story comes from The
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually written by John Engel of
the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_11]: The headline is Police Stings.
[SPEAKER_11]: No Pot Shops Found Selling Marijuana to
Miners, MED says.
[SPEAKER_11]: Police have so far sanctioned no
recreational marijuana stores for selling
[SPEAKER_11]: to minors during underage compliance
stings across the state, according to
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER_11]: Authorities in Denver and Pueblo working
with regulators from the State Marijuana
[SPEAKER_11]: Enforcement Division have conducted 20
undercover stings in which they see
[SPEAKER_11]: whether a store will sell pot to someone
under 21.
[SPEAKER_11]: 16 of the compliance checks have occurred
in Denver, home to most of the state's
[SPEAKER_11]: recreational marijuana stores.
[SPEAKER_11]: So far, no store has sold to someone under
21 in the checks.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they sent undercovers around to
dispensaries to go try to buy weed and
[SPEAKER_11]: they sent people that weren't 21 and those
people were turned away by every shot.
[SPEAKER_11]: That they went to.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good job, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is proof right there that we can
follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_11]: The people that own these businesses do
not want to risk their businesses by
[SPEAKER_11]: selling to somebody under 21.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are plenty of people 21 and older
coming from out of state to buy herbs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they don't even need to risk it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good job, you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job for following the rules.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the article continues and it says.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is imperative that we keep marijuana
out of the hands of kids.
[SPEAKER_11]: Barbara Brold, the executive director of
the Department of Revenue, which includes
[SPEAKER_11]: the Marijuana Enforcement Division,
said in a statement.
[SPEAKER_11]: These results show that strong efforts are
being made by the MED and the marijuana
[SPEAKER_11]: business license to do just that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Licensees, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marijuana business licensees to do just
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: While medical marijuana stores can sell to
registered patients under 21, recreational
[SPEAKER_11]: stores can only sell to those over 21 and
must check identification.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stores that are found selling to someone
underage could have their license
[SPEAKER_11]: suspended or evoked or face a fine up to
$100,000.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says here medical marijuana stores can
sell to registered patients under 21.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are a Colorado resident and you're
a medical marijuana patient that's under
[SPEAKER_11]: 21, then you can go to the medical
marijuana stores as long as you have your
[SPEAKER_11]: card.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go to the medical shops.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're under 18 to get medical
marijuana, you have to be seen by two
[SPEAKER_11]: doctors, I believe.
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be under 21.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's under 18.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're under 18, you have to be seen by
two doctors at the same time and they both
[SPEAKER_11]: have to approve your medical marijuana
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of the little why they
mentioned that people under 21 can get
[SPEAKER_11]: into some shops, only the medical shops.
[SPEAKER_11]: It continues.
[SPEAKER_11]: It wraps up with we are pleased with the
results and will continue to monitor the
[SPEAKER_11]: businesses to ensure the compliance
efforts are maintained.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that you're not selling to the
people that you're not supposed to.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad you're doing your job and
checking your IDs.
[SPEAKER_11]: They mentioned Pueblo directly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out to all my friends in Pueblo
that have shops that are following the
[SPEAKER_11]: rules.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for doing it right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys realize it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You are the example.
[SPEAKER_11]: All eyes in the world of weed are on
Colorado right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So do it right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't fuck it up for everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll give you praise.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got one more piece of news that I
found really interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we're going to go ahead and get
into the grow lesson with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is from the Denver Post written
by David Magoya.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says Colorado's 40 casinos and hundreds
of others, including the gaming Mecca in
[SPEAKER_11]: Las Vegas are bound by the same money
reporting rules that have made banks
[SPEAKER_11]: reluctant to let legal marijuana
businesses open bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Federal authorities now say that means
casinos can keep anyone associated with
[SPEAKER_11]: legal weed enterprise from dispensary to
grow operations away from gambling tables
[SPEAKER_11]: anywhere in the country.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they do allow them to play,
casinos must file the same suspicious
[SPEAKER_11]: activity reports banks must file whenever
they handle money derived from pot
[SPEAKER_11]: profits, according to the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network, a division of the U
[SPEAKER_11]: .S.
[SPEAKER_11]: Department of the Treasury.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is going out to all my friends
that like to go party in Vegas and have a
[SPEAKER_11]: good time.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to quit wearing our brand shirts
and we can't talk about what we do if we
[SPEAKER_11]: are in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what goes on to say because the
government says casinos are financial
[SPEAKER_11]: institutions like banks, they must have
stringent anti money laundering programs
[SPEAKER_11]: in place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Filing suspicious activity reports or S.A
.R.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: to crack down on money laundering by
criminal and terrorist organizations is
[SPEAKER_11]: not new for casinos.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is new is that it now extends to the
legal marijuana trade.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Fincet in February announced how
banks could work with legal marijuana
[SPEAKER_11]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_11]: The government only now realize that it
extends to casinos.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's in any casino in the country,
whether in Colorado, Atlantic City or Las
[SPEAKER_11]: Vegas on land, on water or on sovereign
American Indian soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a casino in the Las Vegas strip would
by law have to pay attention to the owner
[SPEAKER_11]: of a marijuana dispensary in Colorado who
heads there to gamble.
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that trippy?
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that weird?
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're from Colorado and you go
there and you're kind of looking like you
[SPEAKER_11]: got some loot because you own a dispensary
and you're trying to treat your employees,
[SPEAKER_11]: you are now suspicious and your money will
be reported.
[SPEAKER_11]: So currently, 22 states have legalized the
sale of medical marijuana and two Colorado
[SPEAKER_11]: and Washington have legalized recreational
sales.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado and 41 other states have some
form of legal casino gambling.
[SPEAKER_11]: The news revealed June 12th that a Las
Vegas conference directed at curtailing
[SPEAKER_11]: money laundering has stopped state
regulators and the casino industry in its
[SPEAKER_11]: tracks.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Colorado Division of Gaming was
unaware of the Fincet guidance spokeswoman
[SPEAKER_11]: Cameron Lewis told The Post, division
management will be taking this matter
[SPEAKER_11]: under discussion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Similarly, the Colorado Gaming
Association, the trade group that
[SPEAKER_11]: represents the state's casinos was unaware
of the requirement.
[SPEAKER_11]: To my knowledge, we have not been
contacted by Fincet regarding any issues
[SPEAKER_11]: dealing with marijuana suppliers,
executive director Lois Rice said.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like banks, casinos must know their
customer and have some knowledge of their
[SPEAKER_11]: source of funds.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been to casinos and nobody in there
gave a shit what my source of funds was.
[SPEAKER_11]: They had no idea how to tell.
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as they could tell, I worked at a
shoe store.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they had no idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: So unless you're going in there with your
brand shirt on, unless your shirt says I
[SPEAKER_11]: make cash or the big green dispensary,
then you should be cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: But be careful if your money stinks like
weed, if you happen to keep your money and
[SPEAKER_11]: your weed and a safe together or somewhere
near, air your money out before you go to
[SPEAKER_11]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just stop at your local bank in
Colorado, make a deposit and then pull
[SPEAKER_11]: more money out later so that you just
traded money for that stinky money for
[SPEAKER_11]: non-stinky ass money.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just don't want to take your stinky
weed smelling money to Las Vegas or any
[SPEAKER_11]: casino.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got plenty of casinos in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got Cripple Creek and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So be careful going there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll read more.
[SPEAKER_11]: Know their customers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_11]: The casino industry keeps close track of
gamblers through a variety of methods.
[SPEAKER_11]: Including high roller clubs, frequent
player programs and other in-house
[SPEAKER_11]: incentives.
[SPEAKER_11]: Casinos must comply with the government's
guidance on filing suspicious activity
[SPEAKER_11]: reports, said Jim Dowling, an anti-money
laundering consultant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Their alternative is not to conduct a
financial transaction with these
[SPEAKER_11]: individuals who are involved directly or
indirectly in the MJ business,
[SPEAKER_11]: said Dowling, a former IRS agent who was
also an advisor on money laundering issues
[SPEAKER_11]: to the White House.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because marijuana is illegal under federal
law, FinCEN's requirements for doing
[SPEAKER_11]: business with the marijuana industry
modified how financial institutions are to
[SPEAKER_11]: file SARs, SARS, suspicious activity
reports is what that means.
[SPEAKER_11]: The reports must now reflect that clients
are in states where marijuana sales are
[SPEAKER_11]: allowed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you win a big jackpot and you got to
show your ID and your ID, because you got
[SPEAKER_11]: to show them that you're 21 if you collect
a big ass prize, the ID is going to show
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado is your home state on there and
they're going to make note of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to fill out a suspicious
activity report on your ass.
[SPEAKER_11]: The marijuana specific reports would
either identify the cannabis related
[SPEAKER_11]: business or employee as legally operating
under appropriate guidelines, identify
[SPEAKER_11]: them as one conducting suspicious activity
or as one where the casino has ended its
[SPEAKER_11]: banking relationship in order to maintain
an effective anti-money laundering
[SPEAKER_11]: compliance program.
[SPEAKER_11]: The seven page guidance also notes a
number of red flag scenarios that would
[SPEAKER_11]: require a bank or casino to file an SAR,
including for a customer depositing cash
[SPEAKER_11]: that smells like marijuana who might be
trying to conceal involvement in marijuana
[SPEAKER_11]: related business activity.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mentioned that earlier and I honestly
hadn't read that paragraph.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_11]: If your money smells like weed,
they are flagging it, something for all of
[SPEAKER_11]: us to think about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you just have your herb and your
money in the same pocket, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: and then you end up going to the bank and
you make a deposit and that money reeks
[SPEAKER_11]: like herb if you got the dank,
so be careful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be careful if you're in Vegas,
be careful if you're at the bank,
[SPEAKER_11]: just be careful.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're looking for more and more ways to
build a case on people now.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I think that's enough news for
the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take a couple of fat dabs and
I will be right back with the grow lesson
[SPEAKER_11]: with our buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hang tight while I smoke down.
[SPEAKER_11]: This outdoor grow lesson is brought to you
by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach

[SPEAKER_11]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget to check out www.hygrodenver
.com for current store hours and special
[SPEAKER_11]: sales.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go check out the new location in Pueblo
and tell them Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_11]: who you're listening to.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can hear me.
[SPEAKER_11]: They know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were talking about security,
soil, strain selection, teas.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about teas a little more today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Top feeding.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to talk about topping and
training a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's going on?
[SPEAKER_11]: You said we've got about 25 days until we
flower right at this point, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: 25, 30.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully you said 25, 30 days.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before that, the stretch period is like
really noticeable and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: For lack of scientific terms.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many days until you think we see that
stretch period?
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably about 25.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll start in 25 days.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So then we won't see little bud sites
forming for probably 40 days-ish?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That really depends on strain.
[SPEAKER_14]: And even location on a certain property
can change.
[SPEAKER_14]: Flowering times and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's like a structure or a tree or
something like that, I've seen a plant
[SPEAKER_14]: start flowering a little bit earlier in
one spot as opposed to same piece of
[SPEAKER_14]: property 100 feet away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just from one tree or?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a garage.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we do about a streetlight?
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I just kind of went off topic here,
but how much are streetlights going to
[SPEAKER_11]: fuck up our flowering?
[SPEAKER_14]: Streetlights suck.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really going to mess it up?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard that streetlights mess them up.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have really full moon sometimes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've always really deeply wondered this
myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume it's strain specific
myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think so too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some strains are much more resistant to
herming from light leaks or whatever you
[SPEAKER_11]: want to call it.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: The harder indicas are probably going to
be a little more resistant to fucking up.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're heavy sativas.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're more tropical.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hazes.
[SPEAKER_14]: More land-ray stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to herm out.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to like that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I have seen a back porch light,
but plant interrupt the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a plant sitting in a container
just like on the dude's back porch.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it totally hermed out.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the light was a lot more direct.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't 30 feet away and across the
street or something like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd love to hear some input from some
listeners on that topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like you almost have to do a light
depth if you have an outside light
[SPEAKER_11]: somewhere, like a streetlight near your
backyard or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a friend who was actually talking
about his streetlights are probably going
[SPEAKER_11]: to fuck up his flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I told him jokingly, this is not real
advice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I told him to get a pellet gun.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the fucking solution for that shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a solution to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's the one I would
advise.
[SPEAKER_11]: After three or four times of replacing
that bulb, the city is going to wonder
[SPEAKER_11]: what the fuck is happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So about 25 days, we'll start seeing a
stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit after that, we'll start
seeing our buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: When should we start changing to a
flowering feed?
[SPEAKER_14]: I switch over each plant individually.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I do switch to flowering feed,
I make a ritual out of giving them their
[SPEAKER_14]: first high PK top dressing and everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I still give them nitrogen at that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: These outdoor plants just seem to use more
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm helping with a light depth.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're using bottled nutrients because
they're container plants with a concrete
[SPEAKER_14]: floor in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_14]: I really feel like this cycle we're about
to harvest, it was nitrogen deficient or
[SPEAKER_14]: just screaming for more nitrogen the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't quite figure out what it was
because it wasn't just yellowing up or
[SPEAKER_14]: anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel the sun makes them want to grow
taller.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I have any scientific
evidence behind that.
[SPEAKER_14]: They need the nitrogen to grow tall.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you get nitrogen deficient at that
phase, you're pretty much SOL.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be chasing it the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we call it, chasing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You said when you first feed them those
flowering nutrients, you want to give them
[SPEAKER_11]: P and K.
[SPEAKER_11]: Phosphorus and potassium, you guys,
those are the things you want to switch to
[SPEAKER_11]: for the new guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of calcium too.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're using dry supplements,
go pretty heavy on that oyster shell or
[SPEAKER_14]: oyster meal.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just seems to help produce bigger
flowers outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: Big flowers need lots of calcium.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a friend who's growing some
plants that are ... I'm not being shady.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do have a friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, Adam?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got some plants that are outdoors.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't seen them.
[SPEAKER_11]: He keeps saying that the bottom leaves are
all yellowing up, but the tops of his
[SPEAKER_11]: plants look fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: They are in containers.
[SPEAKER_11]: He keeps them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_11]: He feeds them bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think he's just nitrogen deficient
since he's outside?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Adam, increase your nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's your grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, also what size of containers ...
He's in little containers, small pots.
[SPEAKER_14]: When the plant starts stressing out,
it can start ... Well, I guess it can
[SPEAKER_14]: start wherever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Small pots are hard to do outside of Sarah
Trek, so I'm like ... To keep them watered
[SPEAKER_14]: adequately.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a problem he's having.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Keeping the root zone cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: The temperature on those black pots can
get quite a bit higher than that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what size pot should he put them in for
outdoor?
[SPEAKER_11]: They're about maybe two feet tall from the
last pictures I saw.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're about 18 inches, two feet tall.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd seriously probably go for some 40
gallon smart pots.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's 25 to 40 gallon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not going to happen in his world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think he'd be cool with a seven
gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_14]: That would help a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd help a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to transplant to bigger pots,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: All you guys that are growing outside in
those little pots, get into bigger pots
[SPEAKER_11]: because you're going to have to feed a lot
of water because it's going to get hot out
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's already getting hot.
[SPEAKER_11]: My buddy's got to water.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was 100 degrees here today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure by the time he woke up,
that plant was thirsty as shit and then I
[SPEAKER_11]: bet he had to water it again at some
point.
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing you could do is mulch around
the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some kind of organic mulch.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't get that stuff that's really heavily
dyed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the dye washes off and it might get
into your container and pot doesn't like
[SPEAKER_14]: dyes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing you can do is drip systems.
[SPEAKER_14]: An easy fix is a white pan to plastic
wrapped around the pot.
[SPEAKER_14]: White side out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Change the color of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You talked about light deprivation earlier
and I kind of skipped right over that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people might not know what a light
dep is.
[SPEAKER_11]: A light dep can be a real pain in the ass,
is honestly my opinion.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_11]: What you're doing is you're taking a plant
that's outside and you basically have to
[SPEAKER_11]: trick it every night to make it think that
it's nighttime by putting it ... A lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: people will build a greenhouse,
an arch shaped greenhouse, a hoop house
[SPEAKER_11]: type of thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you basically pull a tarp over it or
some sort of cover over it at the same
[SPEAKER_11]: exact time every night, just like you
would turn off your lights and your indoor
[SPEAKER_11]: grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: The lights will go out and then every
morning at the same morning, you uncover
[SPEAKER_11]: that bitch so that it looks just like it's
in the grow room getting the lights turned
[SPEAKER_11]: off and turned on and it thinks it's the
season for it to flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's basically a light dep.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's several ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can bring the plants in, but basically
it's covering it that way as a light
[SPEAKER_11]: deprivation.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's force flowering your outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: Manipulating, physically manipulating the
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot of commitment.
[SPEAKER_11]: The outdoor growing is not as easy as
people would think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: We covered the light depth.
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about feeding a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting my buddy's leaves greener.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about chasing the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go heavy on the nitrogen, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always recommend be careful with it,
but it sounds like if you're outdoors,
[SPEAKER_11]: how likely are we going to burn it
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that the sunshine and the
natural everything is going to help us
[SPEAKER_11]: prevent fucking up?
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends on your container.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is one good thing about being in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little more forgiving, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a lot of water, there's a lot
of sunlight and a lot of photosynthesis is
[SPEAKER_14]: going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, three times as much because the
stone guy and the fiery guy, please don't
[SPEAKER_14]: do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Work into it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Outdoor plants use a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of just flooding it one time,
flood it decently and then let it dry and
[SPEAKER_11]: then flood it again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't just try to go and super soak that
bitch because you'll drown it.
[SPEAKER_11]: She'll die.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's a difference between
watering and feeding, even though a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: people consider that the same act.
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as just dumping water on a plant,
when I feed a plant, I still water it
[SPEAKER_14]: first and then I apply the feed to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Same outdoors with the teas and everything
like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that a lot of the new
growers probably haven't ever even
[SPEAKER_11]: considered.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is indoor and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feed my plants with nutrients every
Monday.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of my plants, my mother plants,
my veg plants, it's just Monday.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the easy day to pick.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't forget.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got it all figured out.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got the Monday ritual, how you feed
everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I fill up two reses.
[SPEAKER_11]: I walk through and water each plant in the
flowering room with a little bit of fresh
[SPEAKER_11]: water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just enough to get it awake.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give it a drink and then I go hit the
other rooms and then I come back and then
[SPEAKER_11]: I mix up the nutrients for each room and
go back and get them.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first watering is just enough to kind
of moisten the topsoil.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't go very deep, I don't think,
but it kind of gives the plant a chance to
[SPEAKER_11]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_14]: It helps the nutrients flow through
better.
[SPEAKER_11]: My theory was I don't always want to wake
up and have a meal.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to start with a steak.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to have some water and wet my
throat up and get moving and wake up and
[SPEAKER_11]: then have some food and some oatmeal or
some whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let them wake up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let them enjoy the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we should talk about feeding
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you putting in your tea right
now?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going heavy with kelp meal,
alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Mexican bat guano.
[SPEAKER_14]: The tea I'm going to make tomorrow
actually.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make it tomorrow, apply it on
Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to put seabird guano in it for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really have any exact theory on
why I do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the seabird guano, the seabirds
have been eating fish, which have been
[SPEAKER_11]: eating insects, which have been getting a
lot of sunshine, which have been swimming
[SPEAKER_11]: in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally, that's good shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: That equals good flavor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kyle Cushman will hate all that statement
because Kyle goes with no shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: To each his own.
[SPEAKER_11]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of shit and Jesse's weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you putting molasses in there?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kelp meal, alfalfa meal, molasses.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mycos, grey white.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mycos.
[SPEAKER_14]: OGT.
[SPEAKER_11]: OGT.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get OGT at High Grove Pueblo on
4th Street.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all my agricultural show,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're lucky, you might catch me there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sometimes Jesse's down there.
[SPEAKER_11]: He knows some people.
[SPEAKER_14]: OGT.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oyster meal.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't put that in a tea.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll top dress it.
[SPEAKER_11]: How about some azomite?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you putting that yet?
[SPEAKER_14]: I apply that to the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said azomite.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, my throat was clogged up.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys are going to want to know what
I said, azomite is what it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something I've never really messed
around with applying to teas or anything
[SPEAKER_14]: like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or top dressing or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I put it in initially in the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've usually seen it mixed in the super
soil, but if I didn't get it in there,
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe I could try now is what I'm hoping
for.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you put any worm castings in your tea?
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you just got a five gallon bucket,
basically.
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably larger for yourself.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I could start, if I wanted to just try
some teas, I could do a five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_11]: if I'm a new listener.
[SPEAKER_11]: I could just do a five gallon bucket,
put some water in there, about three
[SPEAKER_11]: quarters of the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dechlorinated water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dechlorinated, RO water if you can.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're making tea, you got a little
aquarium pump or air pump.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we got to do about two days before
you use this water, fill up your reservoir
[SPEAKER_11]: and put your air pump in there,
not your pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the pump in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your air stones in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put your air stones in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep the pump on a shelf safe and dry.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's electric.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put the air stones in there and just
bubble the shit out of that water for as
[SPEAKER_11]: long as you can.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you want to stir it a lot of times is
what's happening essentially, because
[SPEAKER_11]: you're trying to bring all the chlorine
and anything else.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all kinds of shit in the Pueblo
water.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want all that to evaporate out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So bubble it up a lot before you use it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then use that same water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just leave the air stone in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let it keep on bubbling.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pour in your molasses.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fifteen mils per gallon.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fifty or fifteen?
[SPEAKER_14]: Fifteen tablespoons.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Per gallon.
[SPEAKER_11]: So about two shot glasses worth for a five
gallon bucket-ish.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then... Don't fill it up all the way
either.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do like four gallons.
[SPEAKER_14]: Give it a little head space there.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to have some foam later.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have a lot of foam later.
[SPEAKER_11]: Head space.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's literally what he meant too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got our tea.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got molasses in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't do exact measurements on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_14]: I do like nice little double-handed
handful.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a kid grabbing a bunch of candy?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably like eight cups.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't really overdo the worm castings,
can you?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just expensive.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like two cups is what I think we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three or four cups maybe at the most
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on how big your hands are.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have homemade compost or...
[SPEAKER_14]: you got a cool neighbor or something like
that, that'll work in lieu of the worm
[SPEAKER_14]: castings.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or together.
[SPEAKER_14]: So... Together, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you get some warm poop.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man, you're golden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put that warm tea in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: What else are we putting?
[SPEAKER_11]: We got the kelp.
[SPEAKER_11]: The kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been kind of starting slow on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've used it before, but I've never used
it in teas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So read some stuff this winter and now I'm
going nuts with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, let's see, for five gallons,
let's say, I'd probably do like a quarter
[SPEAKER_14]: cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure you could probably go more.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never seen a good healthy tea burn a
plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: So... If you guys want to read a lot of
these ideas, there's a book called... We
[SPEAKER_11]: talked about it in a few shows ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: What the fuck is it called?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called True Living Organics by The
Rev.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I recommend that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to The Rev.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't pay me to say that or anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: He just writes a book that's exactly what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want a lot of their step-by-step
teas, there are directions how to make
[SPEAKER_11]: them.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are certain teas for certain phases.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got teas for seedlings, veg plants,
late veg plants, early flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got a tea for every day of the week
in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're pretty elaborate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be intimidated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very effective.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those teas are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like... The Rev grows some
gorgeous weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that I've ever smoked any TLO
weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesse's shaking his head like,
no, I haven't had the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say, if you guys have some TLO weed and
you're in Colorado, you'd like to... I'd
[SPEAKER_10]: just like to taste it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll share some of my dabs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw a meme of myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody made a Rasta Jeff meme.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, grows veganic, only smokes BHO.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I'll share some dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if I happen to have a fresh crop of
some Limit Jeff or whatever, we'll get
[SPEAKER_11]: down on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to taste your TLO weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see if...
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hype is about.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to come see your plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just nosy like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can come see mine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you can come see Jesse's.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for putting that out there for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, earlier you said a drip line.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a brilliant idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: For outdoors, you're going to want to
water often.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could set up a little miniature
drip line, it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need a large res to hold your water.
[SPEAKER_11]: A reservoir that is not going to get algae
funked.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be something designed to hold
water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be a cheapskate on this part.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll spend some time cleaning lines.
[SPEAKER_14]: Often.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need a pump.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even remember how many gallons per
hour pump, but depends on how many plants
[SPEAKER_11]: and how many lines.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then you just need a splitter and then
like octopus hose coming out of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing to each plant and a spike.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you just put that spike right in the
dirt near the center of the plant and set
[SPEAKER_11]: a timer on the pump.
[SPEAKER_11]: And however often you have it come on,
water will magically flow from your
[SPEAKER_11]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_11]: To your plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: So all you got to do is turn on that pump
one time, hit a timer, see how long it
[SPEAKER_11]: takes for those plants to get an adequate
amount of water and then hit stop when
[SPEAKER_11]: they're good.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then set your timer for that much time
on every morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: So right, whatever time you see the sun
peak up, boom, seven o'clock, that timer
[SPEAKER_11]: should come on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking water your plants for you right
away.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it never does build up to an
adequate amount, you need more drip
[SPEAKER_14]: emitter heads per plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just bigger tube everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: More water delivery.
[SPEAKER_14]: In a nutshell, I use a gravity system,
but it's a little bit larger scale.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can always put your res at the top of
the hill and run your lines down the hill,
[SPEAKER_11]: basically.
[SPEAKER_14]: Without a really fancy solenoid thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: To open and close the tank, you don't have
actual or too good a control over it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just by the pump and a 55 gallon barrel or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you can almost mix your tea in
that barrel.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can.
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be good for the pantyhose that
we talked about.
[SPEAKER_11]: So throw all of the ingredients we talked
about to put in our tea into a thing of
[SPEAKER_11]: pantyhose and just tie it into a knot so
that you just made a giant tea bag.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just drop that inside there and
let that bubble around in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to get a bunch of foam up on
top of your tea.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't mention that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of did a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: But once you get all those ingredients in
there, let it bubble.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let it stew for about 24 hours when you're
making tea.
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of skipped that step.
[SPEAKER_11]: Put it, set it in a container.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen a lot of guys buy those little
Rubbermaid containers that a five gallon
[SPEAKER_11]: bucket will set right inside of.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_11]: The shit bubbles over.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesse's looking at me like, fuck it,
I had to clean up so many messes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, those little containers are sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought a stack of them one time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love going to Walmart.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to know who grows weed at
Walmart and all the stores because we buy
[SPEAKER_11]: the most random shit in bulk.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need 33 of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, really?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 33 of these.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's only going to work if I have
33 that are the exact same or the whole
[SPEAKER_11]: room is going to look crooked if I have
one that's off.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you guys have more box fans?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm that guy.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got like three carts full of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you climb up on the top shelf and get
me that other pallet with those fans,
[SPEAKER_11]: please?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was me the other day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I need that silver one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot that I don't have a fan anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: So sometimes I go to Lowe's and I'm like,
oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to buy like nine of these,
but I can only fit three in the car.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get rid of my pervert van.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about teas kind of randomly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dripline would be a good idea to research
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be careful with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's such a great idea if you can get
it figured out and get it going.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've got a real job and, you know,
you got rocks in your, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: you couldn't plant in the ground,
even in ground, they're great.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're having watering issues,
you know, you can't water them enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dripline.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get a real simple setup at Harbor
Freight, I believe, for like less than 30
[SPEAKER_14]: bucks, I want to say.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Less than 30 bucks for a dripline.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why am I not doing that in all of my
rooms?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think hand feeding is personal.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get to be in touch with all of my plants
every day.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like mechanized rooms.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate that term.
[SPEAKER_14]: State of the art.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it comes to marijuana growth,
I feel state of the art is, that just lets
[SPEAKER_14]: you know you probably don't want anything
to do with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunshine and dirt, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sunshine and dirt.
So.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a weird question.
[SPEAKER_11]: How do I adjust the pH of my tea or
whatever without fucking up the micro
[SPEAKER_11]: life?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do I even need to worry about it?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't?
[SPEAKER_11]: You just think that all that stuff in
there is going to do what it needs to do
[SPEAKER_11]: and be at the pH it needs to be at?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise you may destroy it, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the theory I've got on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Even putting things like stuff that's
derived from Leonardite, putting that in
[SPEAKER_14]: your tea, you can just watch it kill it
right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_14]: You put it on the foam and it just.
[SPEAKER_11]: Humic acid, folic acid.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some Cal Mags.
Yeah.
So.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Liquids into your teas is a touchy area if
you want your tea to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you're mixing up a tea is to
avoid that.
[SPEAKER_14]: One ingredient I can recommend is called
Sea Green.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great for teas.
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't apply it.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you start to brew, apply it after
you're done, when you're about to apply it
[SPEAKER_14]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sea Green.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is Sea Green?
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like some kelp shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fish based kelp.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty low in PK.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like a concentrated tea in a
bottle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: A good start.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the Fox Farm product that is a good
tea starter?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_11]: Microbrew, I believe.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's either, it's either big on it's fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to Google it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've actually used this stuff a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Had some samples.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of those original three that Fox
Farms put out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember when they first started,
there were three.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's Tiger Mountain.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking of something else.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those original three, and they've
changed their website all up too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, neat.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those original three, can't find it
out here because I'm trying to talk to
[SPEAKER_11]: you, was a great one for making a tea.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Another general hydroponics for this plus
is pretty good for making some teas.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the, oh God, I'm choking too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Big Bloom, I think.
Really?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be Todd.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of these three, the Tiger Bloom,
Grow Big or Big Bloom.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Rev recommends it in his book heavily.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry guys, I didn't mean to rant on that
for no reason because I couldn't even find
[SPEAKER_11]: the correct answer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I feel silly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good base for a tea.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can add that one to the tea and feel
safe, but yeah, read what you're putting
[SPEAKER_11]: in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get the Rev's book, look for the Rev's
book.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let you borrow it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on over.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can use it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Teaming with microbes also.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's a good one too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey Sean, do you listen to the show?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you listen.
[SPEAKER_11]: King Cola, I hope you listen, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't talked to you in a while,
but you would appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_11]: You could chime in on this topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ras Cola.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come teach us about tea one time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're invited.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just message me.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how to find me.
[SPEAKER_11]: He knows all the scientific stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let him do a whole talk about teas and
organics.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm the hippie and I'm like, yeah,
I can do this.
[SPEAKER_14]: It works.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a lot, but I've also got that Soma
vibe to where I can look at the plant and
[SPEAKER_11]: it's like your dog.
[SPEAKER_11]: When your dog walks up to you,
you're like, oh, that dog's either hungry,
[SPEAKER_11]: has to shit, wants to go outside or lost
its ball.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell that about my plants too.
[SPEAKER_11]: It either needs water, it's too hot in
here, it needs to get fed or it's time to
[SPEAKER_11]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can tell just by looking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, kind of like a baby.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're my children.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've heard.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're my babies.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got good soil, we've got good
teas, big pots for bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about a drip line.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like a good project to work
on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got about 25 days, 30 days from now until
we're going to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can top them.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could train them a little bit,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want to get out there and play with
the plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've topped three or four times,
five times.
[SPEAKER_14]: Six times.
[SPEAKER_14]: Different plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've got some dragon headed plants
now, like 90s baby heads coming off of
[SPEAKER_11]: them.
[SPEAKER_14]: My personal plants were a little behind
this year because of work obligations.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, the little tiny guys like
Jeff said, dragon heads.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hydras.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm experimenting with low stress training
this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some bamboo and soft tie.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kind of pulling them down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So grab some of the tops of the plants and
just bend them down so that we can get a
[SPEAKER_11]: little more light to spaces and give the
heads a little more space to breathe,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Give them airflow, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't try to trap your four plants like
Jesse said a few episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't try to trap them between the shed,
the house and the garage and the fence.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give them plenty of air or you're going to
end up with moldy buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the plants know when they're crowded.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can feel it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The roots grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you got them in the dirt, the roots
will touch each other and they'll be like,
[SPEAKER_11]: there's another plant here and they won't
grow into that plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Or maybe it will.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it'll choke the other one out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I read on a pot forum something Tom Hill
wrote years ago about how the plant will
[SPEAKER_14]: never grow wider than the mass of its root
structure.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I experimented with that a little bit
last year and noticed quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_14]: difference.
[SPEAKER_14]: And needless to say, my holes this year
were a lot bigger in circumference than
[SPEAKER_14]: they had been in previous years.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been telling my buddy Tony kind of
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: He likes when he looks in a grow room or
looks on pictures online when he sees just
[SPEAKER_11]: a bunch of tall, skinny plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's asking me how to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, just keep them in small,
small containers.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that way, I told him essentially the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, if you're wide, you got to
branch out a little more.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to spread your legs.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're tall, you can just stand real
feet together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Same idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do we need to look for?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to have any problems right
about now or anything coming up?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the fucking animals?
[SPEAKER_11]: There have been deer and skunk and
everything all over town lately.
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, a buddy of a buddy, I heard
about a bear incident in a bag of blood
[SPEAKER_14]: mill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's lived in bear country his whole life.
[SPEAKER_14]: He should know better.
Man.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing to keep a bear out of your
garden is fucking nothing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no mace and bear spray,
but you don't want to spray that in your
[SPEAKER_11]: crop.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here locally in southern Colorado,
it's been real humid lately.
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of rain this year, which is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck, I think this is the first day we've
hit 100 degrees all summer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I noticed it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the plants are noticing it too.
[SPEAKER_14]: I very much noticed it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I fucking hate the heat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got this big mop on my head.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like we're in an Afghan all day.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I got one on my chin, so not quite
as dense as yours.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still in the face, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the humidity is going to be an issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: It potentially could be.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't had any issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't want to sound like a dick when I
said that or anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we just put a fan outside?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that fucking feasible?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that ridiculous?
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't hesitate to do it at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go to Lowe's and be that guy buying four
fans.
[SPEAKER_11]: And put one in each corner of your garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: And don't sync them up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't make them all look like a concerto
when they're turning all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to synchronize.
[SPEAKER_11]: Make them all go at random.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can put two at different speeds and
make them turn all at different times,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's what you want.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to stir the air.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to just move it around.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to stir it.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it's moist around here, last year I
had a hard time.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a real good rainy season last
year too, it seemed like.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had a hard time getting the soil to
dry out.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I could get tees to it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if that's an issue you're having,
I used fans.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I should have just top dressed.
[SPEAKER_14]: But do both.
[SPEAKER_14]: I could see that as a potential issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: Spider mites, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, this is a good time of year for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to the hydro shop, if you go to
the dispensary, wherever your clones came
[SPEAKER_11]: from, we talked about that in another
episode.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been seeing them pop up in people's
indoor gardens around here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm sure, depending on where your
plants came from.
[SPEAKER_11]: Treat your plants with neem oil,
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got plenty of time if you're
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_11]: Spider red.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've always thought spider mites were
extraordinarily easy to beat outdoors.
[SPEAKER_14]: So just religiously spray neem oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a product called Kapow.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like essential oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: Neem oils and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the Sierra Natural Science
products probably work real great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, a lot of those CMS products are
great.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I use a lot of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mighty Wash, that's just deionized
water.
[SPEAKER_14]: They changed the name of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not called Mighty Wash anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't want the word might in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget the new name, but it's not Mighty
Wash anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked it because you knew what it was
for.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bottle's still freaking pink.
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like bubbles.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard good things about liquid
ladybugs, but never had to use it.
[SPEAKER_11]: How about just some ladybugs or some
praying mantis or some predatory mites?
[SPEAKER_14]: Praying mantis, I've had them hang around
plants for a whole season.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ladybugs, it's a great picture off
outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no real way to contain them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they like to leave unless you've got
some way to engage them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always found them, if you use them in
your grow room, it's just basically a
[SPEAKER_11]: fodder for your fans and something to
sweep up later.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, poor little guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: You find them in your sealed lights trying
to figure out how to get out.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't get out of here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit, dude, that sounds like a good
outdoor grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're right about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: How long until you think you need to come
back and give us a heads up on what's
[SPEAKER_11]: going on?
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple more weeks, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just kind of see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got 25 days till flowering,
so maybe we'll come back maybe right at
[SPEAKER_11]: the start or maybe a little bit in and see
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: The people really like having you on,
dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of my comments are about outdoor grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_14]: All of a sudden, I haven't checked them
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: I tried to on Stitcher, so screw you,
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stitcher, I love you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just screw the comments section.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Stitcher too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that I found the place to go for the
comments, it's really an obscure place.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has nothing to do with the rest of my
episodes.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to go to a certain little tab to
even find it, but once you get there,
[SPEAKER_11]: then they're all there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you leave it on an episode previous and
I don't look at that episode, I won't see
[SPEAKER_11]: the comment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Leave them on either the main page if you
can find it or on episode 13 is where I
[SPEAKER_11]: check for comments.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's old school.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, thanks for coming, seriously.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have you back.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's really great having you help out a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: This dude brought me some organic
cherries.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait to put those in something.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what I have, but I might just
make a salad and pour a little dressing on
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the official word for it,
but I'll cook them down.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a reduction.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, reduction.
[SPEAKER_14]: I kept wanting to say gelatin for some
reason, but I'm a meat eater, but I eat
[SPEAKER_14]: really good meat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Homegrown chicken, just all soaked in that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like some ladies would love you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wrapped in bacon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wrapped in bacon.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the American way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't eaten bacon in probably close to
15 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Haven't had any meat at all in probably
15, somewhere between 12 and 17-ish years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Props on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I was bragging or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that was a humble brag.
[SPEAKER_11]: Something to be proud of.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, man, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you got a busy night.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take a couple more dabs and
let Jesse get out of here.
[SPEAKER_11]: This dude's getting married, everybody,
so congratulate him.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cheers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm clapping my hands.
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but it'll last forever.
[SPEAKER_11]: I met your wife finally.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, your fiance.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go visit her down at Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys, we're going to take some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be back to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys, that wraps up another
Grow Lesson and another episode of the
[SPEAKER_11]: Hygroculture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Jesse for coming out,
doing a lesson with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next episode, I will be recording live
from the brickyard in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: The brickyard is currently a hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to get the city council to
help us change legislation so that we can
[SPEAKER_11]: make this building a dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be talking more about that on the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: I plan to have members of the Citizens for
the Responsible Regulation of Cannabis on
[SPEAKER_11]: the next episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the group that is working with
city council to get the recreational
[SPEAKER_11]: smoking areas open here in city limits.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were kind enough to let us open them
in the county, but we want it in city
[SPEAKER_11]: limits.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of us live in the city.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't feel that the county should have
all the cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So listen to that episode when it comes
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_11]: search for Hygroculture, find the review
section, give us a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_11]: After that, type in a comment and let me
know what you think of the show and I will
[SPEAKER_11]: read your comments on an upcoming episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, swell.i.am.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always fuck that one up, huh?
[SPEAKER_11]: Swell.am.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, all of the episodes are
available.
[SPEAKER_11]: Available.
[SPEAKER_11]: Been at this for a minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: All those dabs are kicking in.
[SPEAKER_11]: All those episodes are available on
iReadGeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're gonna end this episode
with a song from Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is called Woody Brown.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to my ninja, Spence.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks again to Jesse for coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take a fat dab and give your mama a hug
for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'ma enter a stage right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we get the spotlight on,
please?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, where's the snowball?
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet it's coming soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it does, it hangs around until
the month of June.
[SPEAKER_05]: May flowers wonder if they're gonna bloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overcast skies looking for the sudden
moon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sudden gloom still looking for a sunrise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some play chicken and get stricken on the
one way.
[SPEAKER_05]: One day, I'ma meet the same fate.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lonely unbeliever knocking on a chain
gate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I must have came late, cause everybody's
gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't seem to shake the feeling that
there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, did I leave the oven on up at dawn?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm working on another song.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I feel normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm awfully nice on the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real cordial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling high and I don't think it's
just the medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chilling in my own spot like a
reservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting lost, even further from my
destiny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I would have paid attention to my
education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Free spirit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never had to care at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always gonna boot myself up no matter
where I fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Throwing up like never saw skills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I still feel ill from the Marinol
pills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't taking those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taking nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You all know the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, I don't have to tell y'all
anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling half-baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not fully there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still trying to get ahead like polling
hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: If push comes to shove, well, I guess it's
only fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck the top, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard it's kind of lonely there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a good year.
[SPEAKER_05]: One that I won't forget.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started with a broken heart,
but then some goals were met.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a lot of golden people who have
shown respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Made a few mistakes, but I'm great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: No regrets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Push along.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put your shoulder to the wheel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, the realer that I rap than the older
that I feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: No longer am I going for the kill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, I'm more like the soldier that's
holstering his fill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the battle's done and the war is
won.
[SPEAKER_05]: But stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, cuz surely, yo, that's more to come.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, play me out, stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an exit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stage left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you turn this spotlight off,
please?
[SPEAKER_15]: Come, come, come, come, the secret come.
[SPEAKER_15]: Come, come, it's the come, come,
come, the secret come.
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Born to be kings.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad that you made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: From LA to NY, we are getting faded.
[SPEAKER_07]: All across the nation, tell me,
who got the best?
[SPEAKER_07]: The top shelf extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't settle for the rest.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's gotta be that proper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me high as helicopters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chest thumping like a chaper corp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I need a doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking slow like a mobster.
[SPEAKER_07]: Leaning low in my chair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thinking, what should I hit next?
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you high off the air?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dabbing with the judge's extract
extraordinaire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony Tangi to the TI Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got him well aware.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, happy Fourth of July weekend,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hope you're all shaking off your hangovers
and trying to glue on the fingers you blew
[SPEAKER_11]: off.

[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get right into the live show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_11]: We are coming to you live from the
Brickyard Hookah Bar in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Brickyard is actually a hookah bar
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to get city council to give
us the ordinance to turn this place into a
[SPEAKER_11]: social cannabis club.
[SPEAKER_11]: But so far the city has been hesitant to
do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we've decided to do tonight is
have a live podcast from here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought several of my friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty brought several of her friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am a member of a committee called the
Citizens for the Responsible Regulation of
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got four members here.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to talk with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm one of those members.
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty's a member.
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend Lee is here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to say hi, bro?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary's over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hi, Gary.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, glad to be back.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess what we should start with.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any idea, Misty, why they
won't let you turn this place into a dab
[SPEAKER_11]: bar, a social cannabis club?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm going to try not to say dab
bar.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds not classy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any idea why they won't let
you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first I'm going to say thanks for
coming in and doing your live show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so in debt to you for bringing this
out in the open for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the city,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not an ordinance in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not selling marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am simply giving people a place to come
and socialize, play pool, throw darts,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's watch a great stand up comic that I
would like to bring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just come and enjoy themselves without
having an alcohol based atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this is, is a social club.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same as we do with our local bars.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was part of what I was heading for.
[SPEAKER_11]: I invited a bunch of my friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: You invited several of your friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are people here that have never met
each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been smoking a little bit of
cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody here feel unsafe?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a bunch of no's from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are six, eight, 10 people here that
all yelled no.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a hell no from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So do you guys all feel like we could all
be friends and be adults here and do this
[SPEAKER_11]: responsibly?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you saw somebody here fucking up,
would you feel free to call them out and
[SPEAKER_11]: keep this place safe for us?
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: As a community, that's what we do,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to govern ourselves because we're
all adults.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: See, nobody should be, there's a bunch of
people here that are all, I'm going to say
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone's 21 or up.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're probably, I don't want to guess
how old people are, but there's a nice age
[SPEAKER_11]: range here and everybody's friendly.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all having fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I am worried about that my
biggest fear is police interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nervous about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the only thing I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to be the, I don't want
to be the one breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to city council and I'm trying
to say, listen, they're, they're coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: there to our city and they're buying
marijuana and they're going and sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: our parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're driving our streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're parking in this Kodasax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just give them someplace to come
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit down, enjoy, you know, some company of
some people, maybe they don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to play a game of pool, play
something great on the jukebox that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been waiting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a social atmosphere and why are
they stopping us from having this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I agree completely.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need this as a community.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are people that buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are dispensaries every direction.
[SPEAKER_11]: In 10 minutes from here, you can get to a
dispensary, but there is nowhere to smoke
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got friends that run, work,
manage, they all have dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_11]: they say a lot of their recreational
customers are actually coming from Texas.
[SPEAKER_11]: So those people have nowhere to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can try to smoke it in your hotel,
but if you're only here for a day,
[SPEAKER_11]: people are shaking their heads like,
no, can't smoke in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you have experience?
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to come grab a mic for a
second?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let you talk on a mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my buddy, Adam.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's from out of state.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been on the show once or twice.
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of just derailed the structure of
the show, but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going well.
[SPEAKER_09]: We came from out of state and that was one
of the main things we were worried about
[SPEAKER_09]: is finding a 420 friendly hotel.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did have to look on Craigslist and
actually find one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once we found one, it definitely
wasn't the one that I wanted the kids to
[SPEAKER_09]: stay in.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're talking about feeling safe and
having a place to use cannabis safely.
[SPEAKER_09]: The only hotel in town that was safe to
use cannabis is not exactly the place
[SPEAKER_09]: where I wanted to bring me, my wife and my
family.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it wasn't safe in the first place.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just didn't give a shit what you were
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for being on the show all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for coming out tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have you on more.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are driving around there,
like she said, hanging out at the park,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is not cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where we take our children.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know the park is a cool place to go
smoke weed, but that's where I want to be
[SPEAKER_11]: able to take my daughter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to be hanging out with her,
throwing a frisbee and her having to watch
[SPEAKER_11]: you take a dab in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great thing is that if you wanted to
take the kids down to the park that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: too far from here, you can let them do
their swimming thing and come up and enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: the adult activities a distance away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a community thing and
marijuana shouldn't be something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should definitely fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a lot of my customers
that come in to have a a drink next door
[SPEAKER_00]: when their kids at soccer practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just mentioned the drink next door.
[SPEAKER_11]: You do run legends, the bar next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that's going to affect city
council's decision in letting you open
[SPEAKER_11]: this as a smoking establishment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that they don't judge me on my
performance in either place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I've ran a great bar for
four years and I don't hope that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should mention that I really appreciate
you said you appreciate me coming in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for letting me have all my friends
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come take dads.
[SPEAKER_11]: My friends are making new friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys, one of you guys trade places on
one of those couches so that my group and
[SPEAKER_11]: your group are mingling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should do this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is a great thing for the
brickyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get more people here next time,
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll announce the next date really soon
on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kept this one kind of secretive.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't want to fill the place and then
have an issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going well so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're going to fill the
place over this next month because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got that thing that we're doing with the
education on the twenty seventh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's the committee for the
responsible regulation of cannabis on
[SPEAKER_11]: seven twenty seven.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hosting.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did we decide to call it a seminar?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Lee that's speaking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Introduce yourself, my friend.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us what you do, who you are.
[SPEAKER_13]: For now, we can just call me Lee.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm a local business person.
[SPEAKER_13]: I run a couple of businesses here in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to make my first appearance
about a couple of messages that I have.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the first one is that Pueblo has an
opportunity to steer its future and its
[SPEAKER_13]: revenue through the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's up to citizens to take that
opportunity and responsibility.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like she needs to speak to you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Grow it into a future for the city.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the second message is it's not all
about the dispensary model.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are all kinds of satellite companies
and industries that go along with
[SPEAKER_13]: marijuana that should be developed and
long term industry brought to the area.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to have to take a break and take
a drink.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll let Gary talk for a moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have anything to add to that,
Gary, as part of the committee for the
[SPEAKER_11]: responsible regulation of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I do, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: With Misty's situation, they're telling
her that she needs a permit that doesn't
[SPEAKER_08]: exist.
[SPEAKER_08]: So she can't open until she has the
permit, but the permit doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my feeling on it, that's completely
illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's certainly not in the spirit of city
government, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the rules governing private clubs are
pretty specific.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are a couple here already,
like the VFW and the American Legion.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those places are private clubs,
and they allow smoking of cigarettes and
[SPEAKER_08]: things like that that you normally
couldn't do in a regular bar, but they do
[SPEAKER_08]: it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to mention that those are great
clubs, and they are very well maintained,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are very organized, and they're
recognized.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got the hookah bar license.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can smoke in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and there's never been any issues
with any of those places, even though
[SPEAKER_08]: they're outside the norm.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's really no grounds for them to say
that this can't happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can comply with the Clean Air Act,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so there's no basis for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Except that they won't write a regulation
and issue a permit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I should mention that they did just allow
shops or not shops, but businesses for you
[SPEAKER_11]: to open and Medicaid or recreate in the
county with outside of city limits,
[SPEAKER_11]: but right inside of our county.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that hurt me.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little bit of a slap in the face,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of feel like people now are
going to see the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not that I'm knocking anyone who wants
to open a cannabis club that's a social
[SPEAKER_00]: club for people to go to, because I think
that there is a need for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all of our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I was a little disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been open for a month and a half,
two months as a hookah bar, because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid to break the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do everything right,
right, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you are closed right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I am.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did close my doors.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a security guard outside the door,
pacing back and forth.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just checked two of my friend's IDs
that came in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to be part of this to be able
to get in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: To be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of rules, one of the basic
rallying cries that everybody can
[SPEAKER_13]: understand is that we want to be regulated
in the same way that alcohol is.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want the same kind of oversight.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want the same kind of regulations.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all about public safety.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just want common sense people making
the rules instead of people that have
[SPEAKER_13]: nothing to do with the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what the CRRC is trying to do
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm part of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to be the young influence.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the dabber.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the smoker.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to bring that to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, that's what's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great diversity between all of
us and where we're kind of at in the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a movement that I think that
is necessary in our society.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we've seen with Pueblo and the city
council and their moratorium, is that
[SPEAKER_08]: first of all, the dispensary sprung up on
the outside of town, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So what Pueblo is experiencing and now
they've allowed smoking clubs,
[SPEAKER_08]: so they will spring up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what Pueblo is experiencing as a city
is all of the ill effects that that brings
[SPEAKER_08]: with none of the benefits to offset it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have any regulatory control
because they're not in the city.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't receive any tax revenue at all,
but they're still getting smokers staying
[SPEAKER_08]: here, smokers in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokers coming through our city.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're leaving because you know,
what's great is as 30 miles north of me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go and you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't buy marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically they're stopping here and
they're going, this is awesome town,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I go smoke?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and go to Colorado Springs,
speakeasies, places like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just took revenue out of a lot of
people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking Taco Bell, the chicken place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so many places that has nothing to
do with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just leaving and going to Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're getting gas and getting out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can sell a product right outside of
city limits and then they drive away.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's no reason that with the,
as many places as there are in the county
[SPEAKER_08]: already, there's no reason to not allow
them in the city.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pointless in every way.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are just as many cannabis users,
probably more in city limits.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anybody here live in city limits?
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody nods.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are people behind me too.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're creeping on me.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm scaring the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we've seen some progress lately,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: They've just allowed the, um, grow
operations, concentrate manufacturers and
[SPEAKER_08]: Edibles manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_08]: The city council has just passed that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty's husband's asking for a microphone.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll pass it to him and let him introduce
himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name's Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to say, you know,
you guys were talking about the revenue
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of this and everybody looks at it
as a business aspects or aspect of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it is a business aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you guys are talking about Pueblo
and like you guys talked about Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: County and all that stuff, and they're
making revenue out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the city's hurting for some revenue
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the taxes that the city would make off
of these taxes that you would get for
example, if you're going to make money off
of these taxes, if you're going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: money off of these taxes that happen in
these clubs that you're going to revenue
[SPEAKER_01]: inflate the city taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they forget about looking into
that situation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not only a business prospect for
the personal owners or the personal people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are trying to make a profit or trying
to make a business that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also help the city and the city
is also going to benefit off of these
[SPEAKER_01]: prospects that are coming about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they can just let things happen the
way they're supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been voted in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been the way it's supposed to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they can make this happen,
it would only benefit the city as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that are trying to make this
happen to benefit themselves as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for as a business aspect, it would help
the city and the state as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are trying to make this
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more right now at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I feel about it is this should be
a place of socialism.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has people been saying,
hey, come on, smoke a bowl?
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug that they're so afraid of that's
called marijuana is something that people
[SPEAKER_00]: actually hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hang out and do great things with and
socially hanging out and being people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish that they would just see that,
that that's what it is, a social
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the reasons that the city council
said they don't want to open places like
[SPEAKER_11]: this is because if the police or fire
department did have to come here,
[SPEAKER_11]: they would walk in and there's so much
smoke in the room that they would be too
[SPEAKER_11]: high to do their jobs and they would be
unable to perform.
[SPEAKER_11]: Greg, you're not a pot smoker,
are you?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said no, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't give him the mic back for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you high being in here?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said no, sir and shook his head.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been here the whole time,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hour and a half or so.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not high, you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if your paramedics are getting high,
if the cops are getting high, that's on
[SPEAKER_11]: their own time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just from being in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not from being in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that excuse sucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Find a new excuse, you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to break in and say that we
have the situation that we're facing
[SPEAKER_13]: because the municipality did not seek the
citizens' input before these laws were put
[SPEAKER_13]: into place.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we had a situation where the people
making the laws were not the people in the
[SPEAKER_13]: smoking community.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things that the CRRC is a
vehicle for the public to interface with
[SPEAKER_13]: its government.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to break in and say that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what sparked the CRRC.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be giving information on how to
interface with us sometime during the
[SPEAKER_13]: program.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I will do an intro and an outro tags
on this and I'll make sure to get all the
[SPEAKER_11]: Facebook information, all the website,
anything there is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get all that on there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to keep up with all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when is the next?
[SPEAKER_11]: What can the city council, the city
members here do?
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we go to city council meetings and try
to talk and try to just show a presence to
[SPEAKER_11]: help get these places open?
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: The public is invited to city council
meetings once.
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's twice a month.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's every other Monday.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every other Monday citizens can come out.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can sign up to speak to the council.
[SPEAKER_13]: They can ask questions and basically make
themselves make themselves heard to the
[SPEAKER_13]: people that are affecting their lives
every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not just here in Pueblo,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do that wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's an issue, not just cannabis,
but if you want to support cannabis,
[SPEAKER_11]: if you have something in your local region
that you need fixed, go to city council,
[SPEAKER_11]: start finding out the steps you can take
to get it on a ballot to talk to.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes all you have to do is talk to a
council member and they will solve a
[SPEAKER_11]: problem for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a local issue here recently.
[SPEAKER_11]: They got a little blown up and a city
council member called the guy that had the
[SPEAKER_11]: problem and he said, Hey, here's the
solution.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all it took was for them to
talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe all you need to do is get with
the right city council people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody is kind of snickering in this
room.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we should say any of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the city council meetings and
wherever you are and contribute,
[SPEAKER_11]: be part of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't bitch and complain if you don't
do something about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Gary.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we've done so far with the CRRC
working on Misty's behalf is we've gone to
[SPEAKER_08]: one city council member, the only one we
could get an appointment with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our proposal at that time was they
want to put this on the ballot for
[SPEAKER_08]: recreational and medical sales within the
city limits.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they want a tax on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they want that on the ballot in
November.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're cool with that, but we want them
to go ahead with the club rules.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went in there suggesting that maybe
you can put the clubs on the ballot as you
[SPEAKER_08]: want to in November.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the meantime, issue us a
provisional permit so that when people go
[SPEAKER_08]: to vote in November, they can vote based
on actual facts, the actual operation of
[SPEAKER_08]: this business for a few months.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were, you know, willing to accept a
30 day permit, you know, to start out just
[SPEAKER_08]: to show them how this business would
operate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were told no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they steered us to why don't we try
to get this moved up on the agenda?
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've hit a stonewall with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we're asking for both.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're asking for a provisional permit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want this on the agenda now rather
than in November.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, you know, that's really where we
are.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we need support with.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need you to call.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need you to email your city council
members and tell them that we want this on
[SPEAKER_08]: the agenda.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want some places open now so we can
see how it works before we vote.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's working well tonight.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have Gary.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary will take the responsibility of
emailing me all of the phone numbers and
[SPEAKER_11]: email addresses and I will tweet them,
Facebook them so that all the agriculture
[SPEAKER_11]: listeners can see that big list.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a little army going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for everybody that will support us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this sounds like just a big local pep
talk, but guys, it's everywhere you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have legal cannabis and you don't
like what you have, you can fix it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't have legal cannabis,
you can fix it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get it going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: Legalize the world is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: So go ahead, Lee.
[SPEAKER_11]: You look like you had something profound
about to say.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to say that one thing
that Puebloans and Coloradans in general
[SPEAKER_13]: should be embracing is their ability and
their right to produce their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is going unaddressed basically since
the laws have been enacted and it's so
[SPEAKER_13]: much cheaper to produce your measure
yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many other benefits and things
you can do with the whole plant as opposed
[SPEAKER_13]: to just having the buds that you get at
retail.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanted to throw that in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can juice your leaves.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can make tea out of the roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many great things you can do
with the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to be able to touch
base on a lot of that on the educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that a lot of people,
I think that they see that word marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: as a fear factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that on the 27th of this month
here at the Brickyard, people are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in that are so curious that they want
to get that close, but they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want knowledge and they want to
know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what we're going to do
on the 27th there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the 27th, I don't know if we've
talked about this very much yet,
[SPEAKER_11]: on the 27th here at the Brickyard in
Pueblo, Colorado, I'll post the address
[SPEAKER_11]: and everything online.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to have an educational
seminar.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have six or seven speakers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary, Lee, Misty, myself, a couple other
folks are going to speak.
[SPEAKER_11]: Terry from Mary Jane's.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Mary Jane's, Glass
Haberdashery, by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Terry was under the weather
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: She called me earlier and she said that
she was not feeling very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what, if it wasn't for Terry,
and that's the honest to God truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have taken the leap that I've
taken.
[SPEAKER_11]: She put me in touch.
[SPEAKER_11]: I put her in touch with Gary.
[SPEAKER_11]: She asked me about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the person to just kind of have a
great relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just is a wonderful woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate her immensely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're doing this seminar.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have some education.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our friends are going to do a little
history lesson.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lee is going to bring possibly bring
businesses.
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't solidified this yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring businesses and do like a job fair.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary is going to run around and try to
administrate everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, something we'll have going on on the
27th is we'll have free memberships to the
[SPEAKER_08]: CRRC.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to we want to sign up as many
members as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we're just in an
organizational stage as we've been,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, we've been assembled for less
than a month.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we'll be doing is, you know,
when it's the day to come to the city
[SPEAKER_08]: council to speak, we'll be we'll be
issuing action alerts to our base.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to get everybody signed up
who's willing to, you know, to come out or
[SPEAKER_08]: send an email or make a phone call at
those critical times.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we want to start collecting that as
part of our seminar.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be, you know, what I'm doing,
you know, trying to drum up business
[SPEAKER_08]: memberships, things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we want to create,
you know, after we get Misty's problem
[SPEAKER_08]: solved, we want to go forward with an
organization that can be an activist for
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis related businesses in the
community and the cannabis community in
[SPEAKER_08]: general.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, from us smokers,
from medical users, recreational users,
[SPEAKER_08]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we see the influence we have already
as a small just forming group.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we see the huge vacuum of influence on
the local, county and state level that
[SPEAKER_08]: there really needs to be an organization
that's pushing for those interests because
[SPEAKER_08]: there really isn't one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different chapters, you know,
like I know that Lee was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly having his own group of,
you know, North.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's an awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an awesome idea to have someone
that you can rely on and a statewide,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, community that we may live,
you know, 25, 30 minutes away,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have someone we can connect with
out there if we needed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: We definitely, we definitely want to go
statewide with the organization.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the reasons goes back to about
the satellite businesses around the
[SPEAKER_13]: marijuana industry and an organized group
can go out and court industry that can
[SPEAKER_13]: bring long term jobs.
[SPEAKER_13]: There needs to be a distribution hub
between Denver and the front range.
[SPEAKER_13]: There isn't one now and nobody's going out
to court these businesses.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody's going out to court the production
of packaging, all kinds of businesses that
[SPEAKER_13]: could be a hub in Pueblo and on the front
range.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need jobs here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was going to say, and we don't want
the big corporate bullshit coming in here
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep this local.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep this a Colorado thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't want these big
corporations from California and New York
[SPEAKER_00]: and these billionaires to come here and
swoop something up that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a guy that's starting with 200,000,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want, I think that it's going to
suck if we just get bought out and it just
[SPEAKER_13]: becomes this big corporate Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's not here is the level of
education that makes those people
[SPEAKER_13]: comfortable investing in what we've got
going.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, and we take it upon ourselves as
citizens and as business owners to start
[SPEAKER_13]: this group to, to educate people and bring
that level of education up to where it's
[SPEAKER_13]: not a dirty investment anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: Something that's above the board,
something that's appreciated for what it
[SPEAKER_13]: is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes good management to run any
company, not just one in the marijuana
[SPEAKER_13]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think my biggest fears is that
we're going to have another, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: another company come in here and they're
going to bring all of them millions in and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to bring their corporate
people and their workers from other States
[SPEAKER_00]: to move to Colorado to work their big
grows and their big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that just, I think that that's a
fair for a lot of Coloradans that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to become a corporate thing because
there is money to be made in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those of us in the cannabis industry with
small cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I fear it, but I see that why I have
a seed company.
[SPEAKER_11]: I breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a seed company that's well known
and does all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I see there was just, and I don't know
enough about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Recently, a member of Monsanto was part
has become part of a dispensary team.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's got a lot of us small timers
kind of scared shitless right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can be squeezed out instantly.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only way to prevent that is the people
that work with small businesses like us.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we offer that loving cared for.
[SPEAKER_11]: All my buddies over there shaking their
head like, yeah, that guy loves his shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you can get the same thing at
Applebee's at every Applebee's that you go
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you come over to a different
restaurant, that's homegrown, you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: different atmosphere and you get a
different feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still don't think, you know,
that, I don't know, I'm willing to put it
[SPEAKER_00]: out there with the big companies coming in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have people that can do it right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That it just seems like there's a niche on
it, but you have enough dollars in your
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket and it's deep enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to be changing
drastically over the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be totally different.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you bring a cannabis business here,
please utilize our talent that's here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't bring your own your own staff.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll come here and bring your own
California people.
[SPEAKER_11]: These Colorado folks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we need jobs.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talented.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're smart.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have this event that we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: My portion for the event on 727,
I am going, if the lawyer will approve
[SPEAKER_11]: this, I'm going to bring a small grow set
up here to the brickyard and set it up
[SPEAKER_11]: here over there in that corner is my
intention.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are looking at me like,
are you really going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to bring a grow hut,
a little four by four grow hut with a 600
[SPEAKER_11]: watt, maybe a thousand watt light in that
bitch and a few live plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to grow some weed over there
in the corner for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to tell us all about it,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: My throat will be shot by the end of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will be there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And for my part in it, I plan to do a
presentation about the health and holistic
[SPEAKER_13]: side of not only marijuana, but of several
different botanicals.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people know, but marijuana may be
good for medicine, but they're not quite
[SPEAKER_13]: sure how.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things that on a business
level, I tell my clients is that most
[SPEAKER_13]: pharmaceutical products are synthesized
from or based on a botanical that you can
[SPEAKER_13]: find in nature.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so once you know that, you can start
to help yourself to affect your health
[SPEAKER_13]: situation.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we'll be talking about how you can
use marijuana and other botanicals as
[SPEAKER_13]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have some samples to give out.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have medical personnel on hand to
answer questions and try to bring a level
[SPEAKER_13]: of understanding about the medical uses of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come out and check it out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 727.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's July 27th at the Brickyard.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you haven't ever seen live growing
plants, I'll have plants that will be
[SPEAKER_11]: about 28, 30 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll get to see some female plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: I may have some that are like 70 days in.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I decide to let it go that long,
it may be a little too far.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I might let it go just for the
listeners to come check out for the people
[SPEAKER_11]: to come see.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have some Blue Dream that's just
yellowish shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just some plugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have several businesses that are
represented within the CRRC.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's say their names and be proud.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Mary Jane's Glass.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, we have Legends represented.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the Brickyard here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have Non-Stop Nursing and
Nurturing, which has a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can find Grow Pueblo on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_13]: That company supports growing all kinds of
botanical products in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people may have come to the Super Bud
Bowl.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can find that page on Facebook as
well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of this information will trickle
down on all of these Facebook pages.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can connect with us, the CRRC in a
lot of different ways, not just trying to
[SPEAKER_13]: catch us at a council meeting.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are part of your community.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know us already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've been here for a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: You probably know me already.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary's kind of new.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary's from Texas.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's going to January.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're doing us a service.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need somebody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need guys like Lee and Gary that are
articulate and do the research and speak
[SPEAKER_11]: while Misty's running a business and I'm
breeding seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need you guys doing the research.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is our main goal on the 27th?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we just trying to educate them or are
we trying to show them that this isn't
[SPEAKER_11]: scary?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be a smoke-free
environment on the 27th.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there an age limit?
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of talked about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have live plants here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We might need to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're focusing on adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that in our society right now,
we're considering adults 21 years of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you can go and you can fight
for your country at the age of 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: which bothers me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our society right now, I think that
we need to abide by the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is 21 up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to teach a 16 or 17 year old
how to grow a plant right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to focus on other things.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the adult's responsibility to take
knowledge home and share that with their
[SPEAKER_13]: children.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're trying to start from the parents
and the adults, the pillars of the
[SPEAKER_13]: community and have that knowledge trickled
down into the next generation,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is going to view this industry as
something that has always been there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we need to make their impression and
their opportunity and their future in this
[SPEAKER_13]: industry something that's going to make
them want to stay on the front range and
[SPEAKER_13]: not just run away to Denver or some other
state.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope some of my friends from Denver come
down to check this out, because I go to
[SPEAKER_11]: all your stuff up there, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come down to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not as bad as you think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come down and check it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way you can find out if it really
does suck or if it's cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it does suck and you've been here,
then you can actually talk some shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: But come down, see me, check out the girl
I've got set up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try to talk Misty into
letting me have a little VIP after hours
[SPEAKER_11]: party here in the brickyard.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe record another podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't mentioned that to her until just
now, but she's smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: There may be a little another one of these
sessions here right after that little
[SPEAKER_11]: thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, come on down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody from Denver, everybody from
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come meet the iGrow Culture crew.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Until then, come to the city council
meetings.
[SPEAKER_11]: When is the next one?
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys know?
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Monday, 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the date on Monday?
[SPEAKER_11]: You got me.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's coming up because we're recording
on like a Tuesday or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody in the room just went for their
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody cares what the date is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it was stuck in my pocket over
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the seventh.
[SPEAKER_13]: Monday, the seventh.
[SPEAKER_13]: The seventh.
[SPEAKER_13]: City Hall is on the third floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is seven o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's called City Hall Place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that the street that it's on?
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come support us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Help us get a cannabis social club open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brickyard 1027 South Pueblo Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So something that way to frame this just
as a final thought is right now,
[SPEAKER_08]: the city of Pueblo is proposing a
half-cent sales tax to pay for police and
[SPEAKER_08]: fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's got their fingernails in here?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fingernails on the floor.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fucking odd.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why couldn't we have smoking clubs and
their taxes fund the police and fire
[SPEAKER_08]: instead of another half-cent sales tax?
[SPEAKER_11]: Has anyone proposed that to them?
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're worried about their firefighters
and their police officers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's give them a half percent of our
sales here, your sales here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get some sales first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: If this is a social smoking lounge and
this is close to my neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_11]: this is my hood.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the part of town I represent for
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be here often.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody sitting on that couch will be
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm here dabbing, those guys will be
here dabbing.
[SPEAKER_11]: All these guys will be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, gee, there are females here,
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are pretty ladies here waving at us.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just a sausage fest.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some gorgeous women in the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Gypsy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's not a sausage fest.
[SPEAKER_11]: So come on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun with us at the brickyard.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get this place open.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to turn it into kind of some fun
since we've had a lot of serious talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys have anything to wrap it up
with?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty's got to run.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's going to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants to come sit in Misty's spot and
talk some shit on the agriculture podcast?
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wants to come take a big dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do a big dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary's going to do a big dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a volunteer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can somebody talk for a second while I
hear?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just put this mic in a mic stand.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to hear a thump, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I'm going to get Gary a big
dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to give him a dab on the show.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone who smokes should be producing
their own meds.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you've got a closet, if you've got any
locked space, you can produce high quality
[SPEAKER_13]: meds.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can use a dispensary or retail outlet
sometimes, but the whole idea of having
[SPEAKER_13]: legal marijuana is so it's accessible to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's such an easy plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, a lot of our interest and a
lot of our focus is going to be on
[SPEAKER_13]: education on how to produce your own
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let you do the work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to add on to that, it feels good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a big one for Gary.
[SPEAKER_09]: Growing your own makes you, it slows you
down.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to take time, slow down,
and take care of things besides just
[SPEAKER_09]: what's going on with everyday life.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've only been growing for a couple of
years, and it does.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like meditation in a way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was one of those things that I
didn't know about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a gamer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had fish.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all those things stopped when I
started growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It took over my life.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't rush a pot plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it brings understanding of other
things in your life, believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_13]: will parallel what you're doing in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I failed.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a place for insight.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a place for stimulation.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can continue your education.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so many benefits in getting
involved in something new, something you
[SPEAKER_13]: always did.
[SPEAKER_13]: You always smoked, but you never could
quite make the leap.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to try to make it easier for
everybody to get growing in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure Jeff will attain to this,
that you learn something every day
[SPEAKER_09]: growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It never stops.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you don't learn something every
day, then your grow gets old, and you're
[SPEAKER_11]: never having a great grow.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm that guy that always strives to
get to the next level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lee, you seem like a fairly fit and
healthy kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that growing your own
cannabis has contributed to you paying?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know you're a farmer.
[SPEAKER_11]: You grow other fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it contribute to you taking better
care of yourself as a being?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so glad you asked that question.
[SPEAKER_13]: For the past month, I've been working in a
surface mine out in Rye.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so for six hours a day, I move
hundreds.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do about two tons a day of marble
granite rocks.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's such a beautiful setting up there
in Rye.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can smoke there.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can kick it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the work is hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I wouldn't be able to do that work if
these myths about marijuana was true.
[SPEAKER_13]: I even smoke a pack a week of cigarettes,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so don't buy into all the stereotypes
about you've got to be unfit because you
[SPEAKER_13]: use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for coming, Greg.
[SPEAKER_11]: Greg's leaving, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody listen and say bye, Greg.
[SPEAKER_11]: I opened your car right now and you just
went, bye, Greg.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye, Greg.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be back.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be back.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you were a lazy pothead like they
claim, you wouldn't be able to work in a
[SPEAKER_11]: mine.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd never, I'd never, I'd never take the
job.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I kill you, Gary?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bumped into Lee after he was working one
day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I happened to be stopping at the same gas
station.
[SPEAKER_11]: This dude was covered in dust from head to
toe.
[SPEAKER_11]: He looked like he had just been buried and
dug out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: That man was doing work that day.
[SPEAKER_11]: He looked burnt too.
[SPEAKER_11]: He looked fried.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a man that had spent his day.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys should go to Facebook and check
out Grow Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Facebook page and I've got a little
plot of land and I use that plot to show
[SPEAKER_13]: people how much produce you can produce
yourself in a small area.
[SPEAKER_13]: Last year, Grow Pueblo donated over 2,000
pounds of fresh produce to the Salvation
[SPEAKER_13]: Army, the Pueblo Soup Kitchen,
the Pueblo Women's Shelter, and the YWCA.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was fresh watermelons, cantaloupes,
squash, peppers, you name it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the garden's bigger this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: So go to Grow Pueblo, like the page.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of information we give not
only on growing produce, but on producing
[SPEAKER_13]: marijuana as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to take care of yourselves,
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's something I want to mention that's
kind of random.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gary just took a gigantic dab and I'm
going to put him on the spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard you say that since you've moved to
Colorado, you've gotten off of a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: the medications you were taking and you
have lost 10 pounds per month since you've
[SPEAKER_11]: moved here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can see it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that we hang out a little more
frequently, I can definitely see it start
[SPEAKER_11]: shedding off you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have a three-fused vertebra in my
neck, cervical spine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So really bad spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, real painful all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like sleeping is painful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting is painful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Standing and walking is painful.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I moved here, I had quit my last
job because at the end of the day I was
[SPEAKER_08]: unable to get out of the chair,
like literally unable to get out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: chair and had to have help getting to my
car.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just quit and, you know, started
doing the freelance thing, did that for
[SPEAKER_08]: about six months.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was going really well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I decided to relocate here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I got here, and had access to
cannabis regularly, I stopped taking,
[SPEAKER_08]: I was taking six hydroconone a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I stopped taking all of them within 30
days of being here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I can be more active.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can be more productive.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a full-time student working on an MBA
at CSU.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I get my schoolwork done
faster.
[SPEAKER_08]: My grades have improved.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've lost 10 pounds a month steadily
since I've been here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I made some changes in my diet and
that's actually accelerated now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Compared to, from when I first had you,
we had you on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been on a couple of our shows.
[SPEAKER_11]: You were on episode four of Diagroculture
podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, I think, 17 or 18-ish.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've been cranking them out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your thought process is longer and you can
speak longer when I think that's probably
[SPEAKER_11]: from switching pills to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a little more with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that really focuses in like
on the smoking club thing, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people are out walking around
high on pills?
[SPEAKER_08]: You look at the numbers of people
prescribed pain medication.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's got to be a lot of fucking people,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet everybody in this room has a bottle
of some kind of pain medicine that they
[SPEAKER_11]: were just given that they don't need,
that the doctor just kind of forced fed
them.
[SPEAKER_13]: The United States uses 90% of all the
pharmaceutical prescription pain meds that
[SPEAKER_13]: are produced.
[SPEAKER_13]: He told everybody to gather around.
[SPEAKER_13]: The United States uses 90% of that and the
rest of the world gets headaches and has
[SPEAKER_13]: back pains, but they don't go the
pharmaceutical route.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they not still use natural stuff?
[SPEAKER_13]: And that goes, I'm glad you asked that.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's still a lot of plants in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: To give people a practical example,
you go to the doctor, you get a script for
[SPEAKER_13]: Ambien.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of a big dab, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or something like that for your sleep
issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's got a high risk of dependence.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got terrible side effects.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that doctor could very well have told
you Valerian will do the exact same thing
[SPEAKER_13]: with no side effects.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not going to get hooked on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But no one wants to chew on no damn root
anymore, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can make a tea with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can compress it into pills.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can bake it into a cake and have that
cake at bedtime.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so across the medical board,
across the scale of illnesses,
[SPEAKER_13]: there are botanicals that affect those
illnesses in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And my core company is called Nonstop
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what Nonstop Wellness does,
is empowers people with the information
[SPEAKER_13]: they need to affect their health outside
of traditional medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been here in Pueblo for four
years now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've run a doctor's office that provided
access to the red card registry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And provided a lot of services to people
with serious illnesses.
[SPEAKER_13]: Illnesses like bone cancer, like multiple
sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to excuse me.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even arthritis, ocular pressure across the
board.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are specific strains of cannabis
or other botanicals that under proper
[SPEAKER_13]: medical supervision have just as high
success outcomes as their pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_13]: counterparts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you work with the principle of hot and
cold herbs?
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you give me Valerian, you got to
give me something cool to work.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some herbs are cooling herbs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some heat the body.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so mint versus cinnamon would be a
good example of those two working at
[SPEAKER_13]: opposite ends of that scale.
[SPEAKER_11]: That promotes good heart health.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the heating herbs are effective
with things like people who are cold,
[SPEAKER_13]: who have chills.
[SPEAKER_13]: The cooling herbs lower blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even something as simple as a tepid
bath versus a hot bath versus a cold bath
[SPEAKER_13]: can have a positive effect on a wide range
of illness.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm speaking generally because I'm not
trying to give any health advice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just trying to point people in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't need to see your medical agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Lee, we got you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, I'm pretty buzzed now,
but OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, I give them a dab right at the
start of the show that might have said
[SPEAKER_09]: earlier, too, that you grow vegetables and
different plants and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like you were saying earlier,
if you want to learn to grow, you don't
[SPEAKER_09]: have to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Growing is growing, you know, like getting
out there in the garden will alleviate the
[SPEAKER_09]: stress that you have in your life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you if you live in a state
where you can't grow, get out there and
[SPEAKER_09]: start a garden, grow corn, grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, tomato plant is just about the
same except for you can actually eat the
[SPEAKER_09]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tony's going to argue with you that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They feed totally differently.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, you got to learn the
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you got to be out there every morning
with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to play with the dirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to get rid of bugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to learn when to harvest.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all the same principle.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just transfer to a different plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole world works on the agricultural
principle.
[SPEAKER_13]: And even for you religious people,
biblical principles become clear when you
[SPEAKER_13]: grow things.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, you know, you may hear someone say
nip it in the bud or or they want to get
[SPEAKER_13]: down to the root of something.
[SPEAKER_13]: But until you've grown something and
experienced the growth cycle, a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: things just aren't clear.
[SPEAKER_13]: People were meant to have that
relationship with the earth.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's been sorely neglected.
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Neglected by the past couple of
generations.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we've taken the plants out of the
ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've taken the plants out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've ground them up and we've made little
pills that are mixed with a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_11]: other bullshit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only that, but now we have plants that
don't reproduce.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they just they grow one time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at all the other countries where
people eat fruit and vegetables all day
[SPEAKER_11]: long.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't have the cancers, craps and
tumors and craps that we have here.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not obese.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're crazy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they don't have all the issues we
have.
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem is in our government.
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens is our elected officials are
bought by the corporate interests.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, there's a very good chance
that Barack Obama will become part of the
[SPEAKER_13]: staff of Monsanto when he leaves office.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the kind of tricks they pull in
government.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's appointed several people that
have taken away our right to be informed
[SPEAKER_13]: about what we buy at retail for our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm about to give Tony a pretty big dab
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you hear some choking,
that's my web designer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, we've had a lot of traffic in and
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: This was kind of a success.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very much a success.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank everybody that's still
here for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you guys are waiting in line for
dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just fucking rambling and dabbing and
doing all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody introduce yourselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for coming, Reve.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry I didn't say hi to Arnie yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's outside having a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to Reve and Arnie for
showing up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Reve's a listener.
[SPEAKER_11]: She listens all the time, so I'm glad
she's here.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we got iGrowl Culture.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got Mary Jane's Glass Legends.
[SPEAKER_13]: These places, we've got Facebook pages.
[SPEAKER_13]: The CRRC has a Facebook page that's up.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got some people standing here,
so they should probably get the mic.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, if you guys got something to say,
let's hear what you got to say.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Andrew.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just chilling here with these guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I wanted to add on to what you were
saying about cannabis growing just being
[SPEAKER_12]: good overall for your health.
[SPEAKER_11]: Time for me to dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be a lot of heavy lifting involved.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're even doing aquaponics or stuff
like that, it can be construction.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really is good to grow as a person that
way.
[SPEAKER_12]: You learn a lot about different things
that don't even have to do with growing
[SPEAKER_12]: that you can utilize in your everyday
work.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all around a good thing for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've lost tons of weight since I've
started doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great thing for everyone involved.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_13]: To that point, I also want to debunk
another myth that goes hand in hand with
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: People say you smoke and then you got to
eat.
[SPEAKER_13]: You get the munchies and so you get fat,
but that's not what's happening at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens is you smoke marijuana and it
raises your metabolism.
[SPEAKER_13]: People identify that with hunger,
but it's not hunger.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an opportunity for you to get moving
and it's your body telling you that it's
[SPEAKER_13]: switching from using food to burning fat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody told me if I brush my teeth right
after I smoke, I won't get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I tried it or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you forget?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got stoned and forgot.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are listening.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you haven't smoked a bowl, if you don't
have the munchies, if you normally get the
[SPEAKER_11]: munchies, smoke a bowl and then brush your
teeth and see if it happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: As a new grower, since you're paying
attention to your plants now, do you pay
[SPEAKER_11]: attention to your pH a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_11]: You said aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_11]: I assume that takes a lot of pH
adjustment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think about what you're putting
into yourself and your own personal pH
[SPEAKER_11]: balance?
[SPEAKER_12]: I've just started dabbling into that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I read a little article about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It got me interested, but I don't know
much about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you work with the plants and feed
them properly and love them, they grow and
[SPEAKER_11]: look healthy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen what happens when I feed my
plants a shitty nutrient and that's what I
[SPEAKER_11]: think of when I eat a Snickers bar.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I'm never going to be able to
make fat buds from eating a Snickers bar.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need a carbo load.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to stay away from the advanced
nutrients, but the proper carbo load would
[SPEAKER_11]: be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to take a dab who's got
something to say.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gary, I met you the same night that I met
Jeff, which was at another dab association
[SPEAKER_09]: type bar gathering.
[SPEAKER_09]: You look great since then.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody trying to tell you that marijuana
is not working as some kind of- Going to
[SPEAKER_09]: make you fat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've smoked pot pretty much all my life.
[SPEAKER_09]: My parents both smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: They grew pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's my metabolism.
[SPEAKER_09]: I highly doubt it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't eat until I smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the things.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get a bag and I won't eat for three
or four hours afterwards just because I
[SPEAKER_09]: want to be able to enjoy my high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm one of those people that if I get in
the shower or if I eat a burger or
[SPEAKER_09]: something like that, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I'm going back into my bag and you're
not going to get high after that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to wait as long as I can after I eat
to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, people kind of think that hunger
pains are going to kill them and that's
[SPEAKER_13]: not the case at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you just wait, they'll go away.
Food is a social tool that we've been
using.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty is clenching.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Food's a social tool.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also something to do with my hands.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just get bored.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need some chips or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to grab a hoe.
[SPEAKER_13]: Get out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew what you meant, but I was waiting
for that punchline, Wade.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have a flashback of Wade.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's like Wade was on the show
again.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's all kind of stuff to do to
recondition yourself to have better
[SPEAKER_13]: habits.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a tough proposition, but it's worth
it in the end.
[SPEAKER_13]: So growing things, growing things is a
great way to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's plenty of grow lessons coming up
from this show and already given on this
[SPEAKER_11]: show, so don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll teach you how to grow plenty of
great weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Something I want to mention, be hungry
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are plenty of hungry fucking people
in plenty of places that don't have it as
[SPEAKER_11]: well as you do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be hungry once in a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: See what that's like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Quit being a whiny bitch all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be hungry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Feel that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're like, damn, I'm hungry,
be a little hungrier just once.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you've got a refrigerator, then you're
better off than almost 70% of the
[SPEAKER_13]: population.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there's something in it,
you're killing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, 85%.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not just using it for air
conditioning like at my house?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Adam stands in front of the freezer and
puts his head in there and fans himself to
[SPEAKER_11]: cool down.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put your feet in a pan of ice water.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a few points to kind of cool you
down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of refocus.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want the same kind of representation
that we've already got for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want anything new.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want anything fancy.
[SPEAKER_13]: We also want the citizens to be involved
in the lawmaking part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We also want government to understand that
the people voted for marijuana and they
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't vote for bans.
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't vote for moratoriums.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have that situation because people
just didn't get involved.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so CRRC, that's the organization that
we've started to interface with our
[SPEAKER_13]: government and be a part of the laws that
are going to affect you.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you may as well get involved.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't complain about the rules if you
did not help make them when you had the
[SPEAKER_11]: chance.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pueblo City Council did create the
marijuana board.
[SPEAKER_08]: They passed that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've applied to be a mayor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Kudos to them for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They really deserve.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're interested in that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They acted fast on that too.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're serious about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: So get one of us on the show.
[SPEAKER_13]: It isn't as if they are adversarial to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: The situation is just no one has stepped
up.
[SPEAKER_13]: No one has stepped up to feel the need for
citizen participation.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's happened.
[SPEAKER_13]: We welcome anyone who wants to be a part.
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, City Hall, third floor,
7 p.m., Monday the 7th.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can show up.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have applications for the marijuana
board.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can sign up to speak to the council
and get a lot of information and meet some
[SPEAKER_13]: good people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of good people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you can come to the meetings or
even if you can't, come to our event on
[SPEAKER_11]: 727 at the Brickyard in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll post the address up.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to wrap it up for about an
hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody have any final words?
[SPEAKER_09]: The best thing you can do is show support.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that, Adam.
[SPEAKER_09]: And show support.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, for the amount of credit I give
you, sometimes you say some good shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't take much effort to make a
phone call or send an email to a city
[SPEAKER_08]: council member.
It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: At all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if enough people do that, that's all
it really takes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three to five minutes out of your day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're hitting the hookah over there and
blowing smoke bubbles.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how much fun we're having.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anybody fear for their safety?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is everybody going to be responsible?
[SPEAKER_11]: You going to drive home safely?
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cutie Yard is still out front.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, everything's good.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: We recorded for a full hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been here for close to two or three
hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody's gotten crazy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give everybody a big shout out
for that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are the responsible citizens.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank all the listeners for

[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad that you made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: From LA to NY, we are getting faded.
[SPEAKER_07]: All across the nation, tell me who got the
best and top shelf extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't settle for the rest.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's gotta be that proper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me high as helicopters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chest thumping like a chopper,
corping like I need a doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking slow like a mobster, leaning low
in my chair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thinking, what should I hit next?
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you high off the air?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dabbing with the judge's extract
extraordinaire.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only tangy to the T.I.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terps got him well aware.
[SPEAKER_07]: Highly educated, top notch, dabbing there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You damn right we fated, but I still hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_07]: Call me Mr. Dabalina, Mr. Glide Dabalina.
[SPEAKER_07]: The 91 ISO got the rig looking clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dab bar, do it big.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my number?
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen it?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the game of the event.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most will never find it either.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Raptor's fired up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the cup.

[SPEAKER_06]: Dab it, dab it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dab it, dab it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Highly educated.
[SPEAKER_07]: A gathering of heads that appreciate the
movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: A battle of the best where they decide.
[SPEAKER_07]: They discuss how to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: A friendly competition to see who will
take the belt.
[SPEAKER_07]: The title of the champ and the number one
melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you think you got that fire?
[SPEAKER_07]: Put your earl on the line.
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't come looking like SF number
nine.
[SPEAKER_07]: From the oil to the butter to the tasty
proper wax.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Crumble, shatter and a snap.
[SPEAKER_07]: From the garden to a lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: First a nug, then a slab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's silicone jars.
[SPEAKER_07]: No more Ziploc bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking dab after dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taz told me let it puddle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I got it understood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the nail cool down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Slap the car cap on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many rigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: E-nails.
[SPEAKER_07]: No more five foot bones.
[SPEAKER_07]: So many dads.
[SPEAKER_07]: My head's spinning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like when will it end?
[SPEAKER_07]: All snapped.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven, ten.
[SPEAKER_07]: Time to do it again.

[SPEAKER_06]: Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.

Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab it up.
Dab it, dab
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to the podcast, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the show has started,
but Jeff is coughing his lungs out.
[SPEAKER_11]: How you guys doing tonight?
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to the agriculture podcast episode
number 19.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great to be with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I promise it is good to be with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may not sound like I'm having fun
because I'm dying from a dab, but here in
[SPEAKER_11]: just a minute, we're going to get a party
started.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a rainy day here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hanging out real hexing, listening to
the sound of the rain and thunder.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been wondering what to put on the
show.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a few days since I put out an
episode and I messed up the rhythm by
[SPEAKER_11]: putting out a show on Saturday,
but I'm back on schedule with number 19.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Gosh, I think I've recovered from that
dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last night I went to the 710 Cup award
ceremony in Denver.
[SPEAKER_11]: The 710 Cup is a hash festival.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a competition.
[SPEAKER_11]: There were about 50 entries in the hash
contest.
[SPEAKER_11]: What they do is the hash makers enter
their hash, already their concentrate,
[SPEAKER_11]: already broken down into small samples.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there were 50 contestants,
which means they had to turn in 50
[SPEAKER_11]: samples.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those entries are then assigned a number.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they make a little kit for each of the
judges.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're given a little, like a pencil
box full of samples labeled one through
[SPEAKER_11]: 50.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you basically go through and you spend
a couple of days smoking each sample and
[SPEAKER_11]: you judge them by flavor, texture,
appearance.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a nice little list of things that
we judge them on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not part of the judging this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did it last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: This year I did not do any of the judging.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you go and you judge all the stuff and
then you turn in your judging,
[SPEAKER_11]: all your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on Saturday night, last night,
they announce all of the winners.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they do it by numbers to keep it
anonymous.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way nobody knows which sample is
which.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did not attend the Friday or Saturday
portions of the event.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was only able to make it up to the award
ceremony at Coyote's on Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that part was tons of fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: The party kicked off with a marijuana
comedian.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was a little dabbed out and distracted
by conversation when they introduced him.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did not catch his name and I honestly
didn't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't pay too much attention to most of
his set.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bumped into a bunch of friends I hadn't
seen in a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of got into conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize to the comedian for not paying
any attention.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel a little rude about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was there for a party.
[SPEAKER_11]: So after the comedian, there was an award
ceremony where Sean Tron took home most of
[SPEAKER_11]: the awards.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go over a full list of the award
winners just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a funky jam band that played a
Grateful Dead cover that I really
[SPEAKER_11]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_11]: They played a version of Shakedown Street
that I thought was pretty damn awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to visit with a bunch of friends
that I only see at 420 or 710 events.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to top it all off, I stuck around to
hear a few songs from old school rapper
[SPEAKER_11]: Slick Rick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Slick Rick was wearing more gold
than I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen full rap groups not wearing as
much gold and bling as Slick Rick had.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had a diamond and gold watch.
[SPEAKER_11]: His rings were bigger than most people's
pendants.
[SPEAKER_11]: The links in his gold chains were more
gold than most people's.
[SPEAKER_11]: That dude was blingin' the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to give a big shout out,
big 710 style shout out to my buddy Kevin.
[SPEAKER_11]: He saved me a really prime seat to sit in,
a spot in which to sit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know the proper grammar there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kevin saved me a fucking killer seat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to Josh and Jeff from La
Plata Labs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also a shout out to Lenny Lane for
bringing the killer solvent list.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was tasty, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thanks for the good conversation about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_11]: That conversation is not done.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to finish that conversation or
continue it at least.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also a big shout out to Jay Dizzle for the
super tasty and ultra smooth dab,
[SPEAKER_11]: that dabachino with the e-nail on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is fucking stylish and it hits like a
boss, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also a big shout out to Ruga from
Grassroots for throwing and hosting the
[SPEAKER_11]: party.
[SPEAKER_11]: The award ceremony went fairly smoothly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just ran by Mike Fro and Ryan Ruga
Connolly from Grassroots.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they did a hell of a job.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I also want to give a big shout out to
Big D.
[SPEAKER_11]: D was given a lifetime achievement award
from the 710 community.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was great to see somebody honor Dan for
his dedication and his work in the
[SPEAKER_11]: community and not just for his hash-making
skills.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's received plenty of awards for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good to see him get an award just
for being a good dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was well overdue.
[SPEAKER_11]: The part of the event I saw was great.
[SPEAKER_11]: During one of Slick Rick's songs,
the whole sound system went dead for a
[SPEAKER_11]: couple of minutes and they had to figure
out what went wrong to get the show
[SPEAKER_11]: started again.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was kind of curious how, you know,
he's kind of a superstar.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was kind of curious how he would handle
it, but he just waited it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: He stood on stage and kind of cooled down
because it was hot in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he took a minute to catch his
breath and cool down.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they carried on with the show,
but it was hot in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So after that first band played,
it got really hot.
[SPEAKER_11]: By the time Slick Rick came up,
it was way too hot for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So after a couple of his songs,
I took a final dab and I headed out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was mostly my 710 Cup experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: I said we do a rundown of the winners.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me scroll over to that right quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a quick rundown.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess a quick rundown would be Chantron
fucking cleaned house.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chantron won everything, not everything,
but like most of it was just Chantron.
[SPEAKER_11]: He walked away with a handsome check.
[SPEAKER_11]: He got a sweet custom-made rig from Mike
Fro.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had two grassroots hat deals.
[SPEAKER_11]: He got a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_11]: He got enough goodies to fill a suitcase.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they also handed him a bunch of
gift cards.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a big shout out to Chantron.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here are the official results of the 2014
710 Cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from their Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me scroll to it.

[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the dabs I tasted were Jilly Bean
Heavy in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll get to that here in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sativa Shatterer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Third place, THC Cannabis Company.
[SPEAKER_11]: Second place, Sticky Business.
[SPEAKER_11]: First place, Advanced Medical Alternatives
with entry number 20, The Durbin Poison.
[SPEAKER_11]: Indica Wax, third place, God's Green
Earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Second place, Growing Minds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And first place, Indica Wax, Advanced
Medical Alternatives with entry number 13,
[SPEAKER_11]: OG Bubba Kush and Strawberry Cough.
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like a delicious entry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Sativa Shatterer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Third place, God's Green Earth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Second place, Steel Rollin.
[SPEAKER_11]: And first place, The Health Center with
entry number 37, Pre-Jilly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Indica Shatterer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Third place, Native Roots Extracts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Second place, Kind Bill, a cut above.
[SPEAKER_11]: And first place in Indica Shatterer
category was Infusions, entry number one,
[SPEAKER_11]: which was Blueberry plus Grape Ape.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are pluses, not times.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are not bred together.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are two strains that were blended
together.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're blends, not crosses, is what I
think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there were two special awards for the
2014 710 Cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the awards was the People's Choice
Award.
[SPEAKER_11]: And guess who that one went to?
[SPEAKER_11]: That went to The Health Center,
which is Chantron once again with number
[SPEAKER_11]: 37, The Pre-Jilly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then drum roll, please.
[SPEAKER_11]: First place overall.
[SPEAKER_11]: You may be able to predict this one.
[SPEAKER_11]: It went to, guess who?
[SPEAKER_11]: Chantron once again with The Health
Center, number 37, Pre-Jilly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to count them.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one, two, three, four,
five.
[SPEAKER_11]: Five winning that I see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Six.
[SPEAKER_11]: Six wins from Chantron.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chantron and The Health Center there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Out of one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,
[SPEAKER_11]: 12 categories, Chantron took six of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: So congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast
or not, but hope you do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And dude, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to taste your entry.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I hit it, I said right away,
there's some jilly bean in there,
[SPEAKER_11]: because I'm a fan of the jilly bean
strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a big shout out to Subcool and Miss
Jill for making the jilly bean,
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_11]: We should say, and big, big love to The
Health Center, the Grow team there,
[SPEAKER_11]: and fucking super killer job to Chantron.
[SPEAKER_11]: And once again, much respect to Ryan from
Grassroots for throwing the competition.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really cool of them to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a scare that the competition was
not going to happen this year,
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm glad that they pulled it together
and made it happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm reading these winners off of Facebook.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go ahead and close Facebook
so that doesn't happen again.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, message me later, whoever that was.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like that was enough about my
weekend.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do a quick ad or two, and then we
will work our way into some news.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who do you want to do an ad for?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Nature's Green Remedies has an ad.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're running a podcast for our special
listeners.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: They're running a special for you guys

[SPEAKER_11]: They just got a refill a couple of days

[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're trying to get some of that
stuff, The Black Cherry Kim, The Grateful
[SPEAKER_11]: Dog, Act Now, they always seem to sell out
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't help that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just what they do.
[SPEAKER_11]: They order when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_11]: I send them their order when they ask for
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_11]: This podcast is also brought to you by our
good friends at Oilslick.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got my favorite glass rigs on the
Oilslick pad.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a carb cap on there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got my favorite concentrate sitting
on the Oilslick pad.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that my concentrate's not going to
stick to the Oilslick pad.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that I'm not going to leave a bunch
of sticky rings on my table.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a place to keep my stuff kind of
organized.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a nice little dedicated spot is what
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, you hear this sound right here?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you can hear it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a rig hitting a table.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just sitting a rig down on a table.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a rig sitting down on a slick pad.
[SPEAKER_11]: They made a little noise because I set it
down really hard because it was out of my
[SPEAKER_11]: reach.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd much rather set it on the Oilslick pad
than the wooden table.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just feels a little better for my rig.
[SPEAKER_11]: One side sticks to the table real well so
it won't slide around.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then the other side is nice and soft and
your dabs won't stick to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just get yourself an Oilslick pad.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, quit carrying your hash around and
fold it up parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't look classy at all,
bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get yourself an Oilslick container.
[SPEAKER_11]: They make them in every color.
[SPEAKER_11]: So have some class.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get some Oilslick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oilslick products step up the game a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Feels like I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to take a quick dab and we
will work our way into a little bit of
[SPEAKER_11]: news.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hang tight for just a minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am back on the microphone after way too
many fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of way too many fat dabs,
I want to recommend another podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you guys should be listening to
the Adam Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it seems weird that I'm advertising
another podcast that may be considered a
[SPEAKER_11]: competitor, but I don't see that as a
competition in any way at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be doing you a disservice if I did
not recommend the Adam Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Specifically, go back and listen to the
All About Dabs episode two and three and
[SPEAKER_11]: really pay attention to what those guys
are talking about, about what we're doing
[SPEAKER_11]: to ourselves health-wise with dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of that stuff may be interesting to
you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may reduce your dab intake.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm known for taking some fucking huge
dabs, for being a dab monster,
[SPEAKER_11]: for loving to take a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: That episode has changed my dab intake and
my approach to dabbing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those two episodes, I'm not paranoid or
anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just more conscious and I think that
we should all be a little bit aware of
[SPEAKER_11]: what we're doing to our bodies and what we
are potentially doing to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to scare you, but listen to
the All About Dabbing episodes of the Adam
[SPEAKER_11]: Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of saw him from across the room at
the 710 event last night and he was the
[SPEAKER_11]: guy wearing the shirt with his face on his
own shirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: So shout out Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Mitch Shinasa, all the guys
that helped out on that show.
[SPEAKER_11]: All the people that are the guests on the
episodes I talked about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's enough ranting about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get into some news.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where do you want to start?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's start here at home in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado, you're a bunch of fucking
potheads, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one comes from the Denver Post
written by John Engold published July 9th.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're a little bit late, but here we
are.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado study pegs annual pot demand at
130 metric tons.
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn, you smoke a lot of weed,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: A state-produced study has concluded that
high taxes and fewer stores are keeping
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado medical marijuana consumers from
switching to the recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: market, a trend that, if continues,
will have a major impact on the state's
[SPEAKER_11]: predicted marijuana tax windfall.
[SPEAKER_11]: The study released Wednesday found that
out-of-state visitors make up nearly half
[SPEAKER_11]: of the recreational marijuana sales in the
Denver area and 90% of recreational sales
[SPEAKER_11]: in mountain resort communities.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tourists, though, account for only about
7% of the annual demand for marijuana in
[SPEAKER_11]: the Denver area.
[SPEAKER_11]: He says most of the people are from Texas.
[SPEAKER_11]: So most of that's gone to Texas,
it sounds like, one quarter at a time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_11]: The study finds total marijuana demand to
be much larger than previously estimated,
[SPEAKER_11]: the study's author write in their report.
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason the authors conclude is that
previous studies have underestimated the
[SPEAKER_11]: level of demand from heavy users.
[SPEAKER_11]: The new study finds that the top 22% of
marijuana users in Colorado account for
[SPEAKER_11]: nearly 67% of the total demand.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bottom 54% users account for only
about 4% of demand.
[SPEAKER_11]: My lips are all sticky, you guys can hear
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's from the big fat dab I took.
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: If my lips are sticky, how far down did
that sticky shit get?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that all in my throat?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that all in my lungs?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I felt it on my teeth the other
night and that kind of freaked me out and
[SPEAKER_11]: made me start thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just a weird random side note.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this just said 22% of marijuana users
in Colorado account for nearly 67% of the
[SPEAKER_11]: total demand.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a mathematician or a
mathematician, but 20, if there's a
[SPEAKER_11]: hundred people smoking all this weed,
22 of them are smoking 67% of all that
[SPEAKER_11]: weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's funny to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some serious hardcore potheads
or are there people doing what we call the
[SPEAKER_11]: dispensary flip?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they going and getting their outs?
[SPEAKER_11]: Then are they taking it around and doing
what they can do?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even want to encourage or talk
about that, but a lot of that is probably
[SPEAKER_11]: that, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_11]: The prevalence of heavy users in Colorado
is higher than the national average,
[SPEAKER_11]: the authors write.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it says, the department feels it is
important to understand marijuana usage
[SPEAKER_11]: and the demand in the state to effectively
manage production within the regulated
[SPEAKER_11]: industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado department of revenue executive
director, Barbara Brow said in a
[SPEAKER_11]: statement, the marijuana enforcement
division said it used survey results,
[SPEAKER_11]: demographic data, research literature,
and Colorado specific primary source data
[SPEAKER_11]: to compile the study.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of curious because they're not
supposed to be taking our information when
[SPEAKER_11]: we go in, we show them our ID at these rec
shops, but they don't photocopy your ID.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not supposed to be taking any
notes on who's in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a little curious where this data
came from.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to find out more about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody's listening that has input on
how they got that info, if you have input
[SPEAKER_11]: on how they got that info, tweet me,
message me at iGrowCulture on Twitter,
[SPEAKER_11]: iGrowCulture on Facebook, or iGrowCulture
at hotmail.com if you want to email me a
[SPEAKER_11]: long stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would appreciate it because I want to
know where they got that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not supposed to be copying our
data, Colorado specific primary source
[SPEAKER_11]: data.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of weird here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, among the most significant
conclusions listed in the report,
[SPEAKER_11]: few people are switching from shopping at
medical marijuana dispensaries to shopping
[SPEAKER_11]: at recreational marijuana stores.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no shit, it's more expensive there.
[SPEAKER_11]: The study concludes that could be because
of higher taxes.
[SPEAKER_11]: For recreational marijuana and fewer
available outlets discouraging switching.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no shit, you charge us 25% extra.
[SPEAKER_11]: A Colorado resident is just going to go
and get their card.
[SPEAKER_11]: It costs you 100 bucks one time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, get your red card and save all that
money.
[SPEAKER_11]: You save all the money like if you shop
twice.
[SPEAKER_11]: The cost of the doctor and then every time
you go after that is just a bonus.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the retail demand is derived primarily
from out of state visitors and from
[SPEAKER_11]: customers who previously purchased from
the Colorado black and gray markets.
[SPEAKER_11]: The study's authors, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: The trend though has major implications
for the state's marijuana tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_11]: Predictions for revenue from the
recreational marijuana tax once reached as
[SPEAKER_11]: high as $35 million for the first six
months of 2014.
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead, including numbers released
Wednesday for May tax collections,
[SPEAKER_11]: the state has brought in only about 14.7
million so far.
[SPEAKER_11]: The summer's here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet we're going to increase that number
through the summer.
[SPEAKER_11]: And April probably boosted them up and got
them all excited.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I mean, but a lot of weed for 420.
[SPEAKER_11]: So medical marijuana sales meanwhile
continue to outpace recreational sales.
[SPEAKER_11]: Through May medical marijuana dispensaries
had done nearly $165 million of sales
[SPEAKER_11]: compared with the $90 million from
recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tax revenue from medical marijuana sales
though has amounted to slightly less than
[SPEAKER_11]: 5 million.
[SPEAKER_11]: Creating a system where people who are
using cannabis medically can access their
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine without paying higher taxes is
not a bad thing said Taylor West,
[SPEAKER_11]: a spokeswoman for the National Cannabis
Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_11]: The story was from the Denver post.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me go find another related article.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a link here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I just got to go back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: They talk about 130 metric tons of pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: How heavy is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: State of Colorado estimates that it's
annual demand for marijuana is 130.3
[SPEAKER_11]: metric tons, but how heavy is 130 metric
tons anyway?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the equivalent of 287,000.
[SPEAKER_11]: 259 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make it any more clear to you?
[SPEAKER_11]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's also such a mammoth number that
context doesn't come naturally,
[SPEAKER_11]: but thankfully the cannabis crackpot data
team is here for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colorado's annual marijuana demand is
heavier than a space shuttle or a blue
[SPEAKER_11]: whale, but not quite as heavy as a
locomotive.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, it's a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: How heavy is 130 metric tons?
[SPEAKER_11]: They've given us a little graph here.
[SPEAKER_11]: A hippopotamus weighs about 3,300 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: That big ugly Mustang DIA sculpture that
weighs 9,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: A school bus weighs 25,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: A bulldozer weighs 7,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: A B-2 bomber is 185,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: A blue whale is 250,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Annual estimated Colorado marijuana
demand, 287,259 pounds.
[SPEAKER_11]: So our point is we are smoking a whole
bunch of cannabis and nobody's going to
[SPEAKER_11]: jail for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's find another news article to talk
about here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that article is obviously from The
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me find the author of that piece for
you.
[SPEAKER_11]: That one was from Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's our next news article?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I forgot to even give a big
congratulations to Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the part where we're going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Washington, they have opened up their
dispensaries now.
[SPEAKER_11]: This article is also by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for writing all these articles and
making it easy for me to do my news stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of great news sources out
there, but The Cannabis is always
[SPEAKER_11]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a quick shout out to The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: This article headline is The Washington
Shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: Served over 1,000 grams of pot to 400
buyers in four hours.
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thomas Beckley and John Evick,
I'm guessing on that, were on cloud nine
[SPEAKER_11]: when we spoke with them on the morning of
July 8th, and unbelievably bustling cloud
[SPEAKER_11]: nine with electricity in the air and cash
in the registers.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had about 400 people in four hours,
said Beckley, an owner at Top Shelf
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis in Bellingham, Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: We opened at exactly 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_11]: and through the news, we saw that we were
the first shop to open in the state of
[SPEAKER_11]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Proud of you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty stoked, said the owner of Top
Shelf.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to murder your name again.
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize for doing that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not good with these names.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is so new and we're lucky just to get
open.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was a huge task.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now traffic is flowing smoothly and
we're thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Top Shelf served around 1,000 grams of
legal retail marijuana to more than 400
[SPEAKER_11]: customers in the first four hours of
business on July 8th, Beckley said after
[SPEAKER_11]: referencing his in-house tracking system.
[SPEAKER_11]: Since the shop's median per gram price is
$12.50, that makes for roughly $12,500 in
[SPEAKER_11]: sales for those four hours, or about
$3,000 per hour.
[SPEAKER_11]: The line right now has dwindled down a
little bit, Beckley said.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, when everybody's off work,
I think it'll be twice as much as it was
[SPEAKER_11]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Top Shelf owners made international
news earlier this week when they talked
[SPEAKER_11]: publicly about possibly using one of their
crab boats or renting a helicopter to
[SPEAKER_11]: transport their marijuana stock from
Bremerton to Bellingham to expedite the
[SPEAKER_11]: process of finally opening their doors for
their first legal retail sale.
[SPEAKER_11]: That grand and elaborate plan didn't work
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: We ended up not using it because we ran
into some aviation rules and we couldn't
[SPEAKER_11]: go in the water because of the coast
guard, Beckley said.
[SPEAKER_11]: The FAA and the coast guard told us they
wouldn't recommend trying it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I bet these guys would have gotten
their whole stock taken from them.
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have been shitty.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would have been funny and shitty at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would have been like a movie.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, one of the owners, I can't say
his name properly, Evich, attributed their
[SPEAKER_11]: smooth launch on July 8th to a couple
factors, including his request for a
[SPEAKER_11]: smaller manifest for their weed delivery,
which allowed them to count 50-something
[SPEAKER_11]: bags of marijuana before starting sales
instead of counting 2,200 bags in the
[SPEAKER_11]: shop's BioTrac THC plant of sale equipment
and software.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even given all the excitement Tuesday
morning, Top Shelf Cannabis actually
[SPEAKER_11]: opened its doors a few minutes after 8 a
.m.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our door opened at 8.03 a.m.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said, because complying and working
with the state is the number one priority,
[SPEAKER_11]: even over customer service, which,
yeah, that's got to be the truth.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have their Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stores are open.
[SPEAKER_11]: So anybody, I think 21 and over,
can go buy cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was looking at a few other articles.
[SPEAKER_11]: The price per gram there, you're looking
at paying between $15 and $25 a gram just
[SPEAKER_11]: depending on what strain and what shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the Top Shelf stuff, it seemed
like the trend was that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_11]: shops were selling two-gram packages.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're getting two grams of the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was already sealed.
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't get to look at it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've got a jar on the shelf there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got their several jars.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to make up names.
[SPEAKER_11]: They got Headband, they got Sour Diesel,
they got Bubba Kush in jars.
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably had six or seven,
eight or 10 strains lined up in jars.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can look at those and you're like,
I want the Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they give you a pre-weighed bag of
Sour Diesel that was two grams.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was costing about $45 plus tax,
or about 40 plus tax in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it just depends on where you went and
what strain you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking for more information on,
yeah, pre-tax was $29.92.
[SPEAKER_11]: Post-tax was $40.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the price for two grams of a
strain called Sweet Lafayette.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to scroll down.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are pictures of some people's
tweets.
[SPEAKER_11]: $13 a gram at this spot, $25 to $27 for
two grams at this place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what one of the first customers
bought, a two gram package, cost them $40
[SPEAKER_11]: plus tax.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't have a picture of the receipt
on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: With taxes, it looks like two grand bags
were coming to $54.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a little bit pricey.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully it'll come down, but you know,
there's nothing encouraging them to lower
[SPEAKER_11]: their prices.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're selling plenty of weed already.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's probably going to stay like that
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've got a couple more stories coming
from Washington since they just launched
[SPEAKER_11]: their shops.
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's kind of entertaining.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, Seattle's city attorney bought
weed for his enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Denver's did not.
[SPEAKER_11]: When Seattle's loan recreational pot shop,
Cannabis City opened its doors on July
[SPEAKER_11]: 8th, Seattle city attorney, Pete Holmes
was fourth in line.
[SPEAKER_11]: And no, not the Pete Holmes you're
thinking.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not the comedian, not the guy with
the big funny teeth that had the TV show,
[SPEAKER_11]: not him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, he bought some marijuana for
posterity, but he also bought some for
[SPEAKER_11]: personal enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty bold, Holmes.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's funny because this guy just wrote
the phrase, pretty bold, Holmes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sounds like he's being a gangster.
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty bold, Holmes.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, the most important takeaway
here is that today marijuana sales became
[SPEAKER_11]: legal and I'm here to personally exercise
myself this new freedom, Holmes told media
[SPEAKER_11]: on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought two two-gram bags of OG Pearl,
which was recommended.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm keeping one bag for posterity and one
bag for personal enjoyment at some point
[SPEAKER_11]: when it's appropriate.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this dude just admitted he's going to
puff down two grams.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully he shares with a good friend and
they have a good laugh.
[SPEAKER_11]: A customer, Vivian McPeak, who happens to
be the executive director of Seattle
[SPEAKER_11]: Hempfest said he was proud of his city
attorney.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm inherently proud our city attorney has
played a groundbreaking role in making
[SPEAKER_11]: this happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: The shift in public policy, McPeak told a
reporter.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's backing up his words and is going to
take some big, nice, long deep talks at
[SPEAKER_11]: home.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Holmes' bold move got us wondering.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did Denver city attorney Scott Martinez
buy any marijuana for personal or
[SPEAKER_11]: professional reasons on January 1st?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have I bought any?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I have not bought any.
[SPEAKER_11]: On January 1st or since then, Martinez
told the cannabis on July 8th.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, by the way, I didn't mention this
article comes once again from the
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do know Pete, their city attorney
has elected and he campaigned on the
[SPEAKER_11]: issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: Martinez's point is straightforward.
[SPEAKER_11]: While he was appointed city attorney by
Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, Holmes was
[SPEAKER_11]: elected by the people of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_11]: As an elected official, he certainly has a
different, well, he's an elected official,
[SPEAKER_11]: so I wouldn't comment on what his path is,
Martinez said, but we both have an
[SPEAKER_11]: obligation to uphold the law and I know
what an important job it is and wish him
[SPEAKER_11]: the best as he goes forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: In this new time for Seattle and
Washington, Martinez said, Holmes had
[SPEAKER_11]: visited Colorado and has seen legal
recreational marijuana industry in action.
[SPEAKER_11]: Previous to Washington's opening day of
retail sales on July 8th.
[SPEAKER_11]: We certainly share information because
it's important to share best practices,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially as we're on the forefront of a
unique legal issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: Martinez said, he's a smart guy,
well-educated.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got a big job ahead of him.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue that sharing of
information.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the city attorney bought some pot,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I got to scroll back because
right after that, there was another
[SPEAKER_11]: article that came out and the headline is,
and I'm sorry, I'm going slow here.
[SPEAKER_11]: My internet is slow right here right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, no pot allowed at the office.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seattle city attorney, cops to breaking
the rules.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Seattle city attorney, Pete Holmes
admitted he broke a drug-free workplace
[SPEAKER_11]: rule when he bought marijuana on the first
day of legal sales in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_11]: Holmes has been a big supporter of the
legal marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he says he wanted to be one of the
first customers in Seattle's cannabis city
[SPEAKER_11]: on Tuesday to honor what he called a
tectonic shift in policy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He says he then brought the two unopened
packages back to city hall before taking
[SPEAKER_11]: them home.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next day, the city's personnel
department issued a memo reminding
[SPEAKER_11]: employees they can't have marijuana when
they're on official business or at city
[SPEAKER_11]: offices.
[SPEAKER_11]: Holmes issued an apology Friday and said
he volunteered to donate $3,000 to the
[SPEAKER_11]: downtown emergency service center,
an organization that provides housing for
[SPEAKER_11]: alcoholic, mentally ill, or otherwise
vulnerable people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that turned into an expensive ass two
grams of weed for city attorney Pete
[SPEAKER_11]: Holmes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, there's a picture of him here shaking
hands with the clerk from cannabis city.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's got a big old grin on his face
looking at the weed like, huh,
[SPEAKER_11]: weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's smiling at him like,
that's the city attorney.
[SPEAKER_11]: One guy's not sure what to think.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, can he arrest me?
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: So even the city attorney kind of fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_11]: He bought his weed and he took it right to
the office.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was proud.
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You walk around with your new bag all
excited.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's another article related to the
Washington cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only pot shop in Seattle sells out.
[SPEAKER_11]: 11 pounds of marijuana are gone in three
days.
[SPEAKER_11]: With taxes, the shop's pre-packaged two
gram bag sold for $46.77.
[SPEAKER_11]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_11]: This article is actually from Allison
Vection from Bloomberg News.
[SPEAKER_11]: Seattle pot shop Cannabis City,
the only licensed marijuana retailer in
[SPEAKER_11]: Washington's largest city, ran out of
stock on the third day of state approved
[SPEAKER_11]: sales, its owner said.
[SPEAKER_11]: The store, one of 25 licensed statewide
this week, had 11 pounds, which is 4,990
[SPEAKER_11]: grams of pot when it opened July 8th and
it sold out around 5 PM local time
[SPEAKER_11]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Owner James Lathrop, sorry, I fucked up
last name so bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_11]: James said, with taxes, two gram bag sold
for $46.77.
[SPEAKER_11]: We knew it was coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't have any guaranteed additional
deliveries.
[SPEAKER_11]: According to the Associated Press,
this guy doesn't expect to get more supply
[SPEAKER_11]: for 10 to 15 days.
[SPEAKER_11]: Washington, home to Amazon.com,
Microsoft and Starbucks, became the second
[SPEAKER_11]: state after Colorado to permit the sale of
marijuana for recreational use.
[SPEAKER_11]: Plotters in both states approved the
ballot initiatives in 2012 and Colorado
[SPEAKER_11]: retailers began sales in January.
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy said growers didn't receive
licenses in time to produce enough
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana for the store's opening this
week.
[SPEAKER_11]: The plants take three to four months to
mature, he said.
[SPEAKER_11]: Washington issued 90 licenses to pot
growers and processors as of last week,
[SPEAKER_11]: according to Brian Smith, a spokesman for
the Washington State Liquor Control Board,
[SPEAKER_11]: an agency charged with regulating the
industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they didn't get their grows set up in
time and they had to open up and guess
[SPEAKER_11]: what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Not enough reefer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to the pot world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And who the fuck opens up a store with 11
pounds?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's small talk.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like any hustler should move through 11
pounds in a week.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nah, okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're sold out of weed at some places
and they're saying right here that two
[SPEAKER_11]: grams was going for $46.77.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little pricey.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got one more little piece of news
that comes from Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: They put out a press release thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a whole bunch of answers to
Washington weed sale, six questions
[SPEAKER_11]: answered.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one question that I found
interesting that I could share with you
[SPEAKER_11]: guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, how much can I buy?
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is Washington.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep that in mind because the laws are
different in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: I found this interesting because in
Colorado, they forgot to write this law.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so now they're trying to figure this
out now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in Washington, they put it in there
correctly at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it says, how much can I buy?
[SPEAKER_11]: State law allows the sale of up to an
ounce of dried marijuana, 16 ounces of pot
[SPEAKER_11]: infused solids, 72 ounces of pot infused
liquids, which would be tinctures or
[SPEAKER_11]: solvents.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume salves, whatever you want
to call that, that liquid shit you rub in
[SPEAKER_11]: that I don't, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't do much for me, but seven
grams of concentrated marijuana like
[SPEAKER_11]: hashish to adults over 21, whether you're
a Washington resident or not, but there
[SPEAKER_11]: isn't expected to be any infused food or
drink available right away.
[SPEAKER_11]: As of last week, the liquor control board
had not issued any licenses to processors
[SPEAKER_11]: for those products or approved any edibles
for sale.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some stores are talking about limiting
customers to one two gram package each to
[SPEAKER_11]: make sure there's enough for everyone to
buy some, which appears to be what
[SPEAKER_11]: happened on the first day of sales.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the shops in Colorado were
limiting it to an eighth or a quarter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually lucky enough to be the
first person to buy recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: at the greener side dispensary in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I actually picked up two eighths.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were not limiting sales that day,
but they were not doing gram sales is what
[SPEAKER_11]: they were doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an eighth minimum and they had
everything prepackaged.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, they weren't doing any grams.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they didn't have any of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, let me get a gram of this,
a gram of this, a gram of this.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, let me get an eighth.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me get an eighth.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I picked up the Girl Scout cookies and
some Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to tell you the truth, those packages
are still sealed on my desk with the
[SPEAKER_11]: receipt sitting next to them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not smoked it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't touched it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hardly smoke herb that I did not grow
myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm picky like that, but I had to be
first, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been the weed guy in this area since
before we should talk about being the weed
[SPEAKER_11]: guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt like I had to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to the greener side dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Hank and all that crew,
Garden of Weeden, all those guys right on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_11]: While I'm doing shout outs, I should do
one quick ad and then we're going to do
[SPEAKER_11]: another news topic here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where is my ad page?
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: This podcast is proudly brought to you by
Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you guys have noticed I only use
sponsors that I trust and then I actually
[SPEAKER_11]: use their products.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have any bullshit sponsors.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't accept sponsors that I wouldn't
fully recommend to my friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beech
Street Unit F or stop by the new location
[SPEAKER_11]: in Pueblo, Colorado at 618 East 4th

[SPEAKER_11]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_11]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget to check out www.hygrodenver
.com for current store hours and special
[SPEAKER_11]: sales.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop in the Pueblo store.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell them you're listening to the Hygro
Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'd like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got a lot of cool shit so OGT,
I recommend that shit strongly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can get it at Hygro Denver,
Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell them I sent you.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to find this other article.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm clicking around, trying to find it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the computer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody typed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I promise you it exists.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who remembers the episode where we gave
thanks to Mr. Mark Emery?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Emery is a guy who was in federal
prison in America and he actually did not
[SPEAKER_11]: commit any crime in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a Canadian guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was shipping seeds across the world and
the Canadian authorities and the American
[SPEAKER_11]: authorities united and they extradited him
to America and they put his ass in prison.
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually served, let's see,
1,590 days, which guess what?
[SPEAKER_11]: That means he was officially, his sentence
ended July 9th.
[SPEAKER_11]: He is not home yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a bunch of crap you got to go
through once you get out of prison and
[SPEAKER_11]: you're not a US citizen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to read something.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from Mark Emery's blog.
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually comes from cannabisculture
.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of it is written by his wife Jodie.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been paying a lot of attention to
what's going on with Mark through his
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_11]: His wife Jodie updates the Twitter forum
quite often and he was actually allowed
[SPEAKER_11]: internet access in the prison he was in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll quit rambling and here is by Mark
Emery written Monday, June 30th with a few
[SPEAKER_11]: updates from Jodie Emery spattered in
there and I'll let you know when those
[SPEAKER_11]: happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this says, this is my last blog from
the terminals of the US Bureau of Prisons.
[SPEAKER_11]: My sentence was for five years,
which would be 1,825 days and I earned all
[SPEAKER_11]: 235 days on my eligible good conduct
credit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my sentence officially ends at 1,590
days, which is Wednesday, July 9th.
[SPEAKER_11]: On Thursday, July 10th, US immigration
picks me up and takes me to the private
[SPEAKER_11]: for-profit GEO group or GEO group,
LaSalle Detention Facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Gina, Louisiana, where I will be
processed for deportation back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then this is where Jodie interjects
with an update.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says July 11th update by Jodie Emery.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark is not at LaSalle Detention Facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: He has been sent to Teensas, I don't know
how to read that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Teensas Parish Detention Center in
Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_11]: They give his alien ID number and she
says, I don't know how long he will be
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can look up his alien ID number at the
Immigrations and Customs Enforcement
[SPEAKER_11]: website.
[SPEAKER_11]: Detainee locator page for information
about where he currently is.
[SPEAKER_11]: She gives an address to send Mark letters
or books.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can only order the books online.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't be sent from an individual.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to come from a distributor or a
vendor so that they know you're not
[SPEAKER_11]: sticking shit in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then there is an address to ship books
to.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will read it right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: He will be there until August,
he predicts.
[SPEAKER_11]: So here is the address, Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's M-A-R-C-E-M-E-R.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you've got to put this number,
this is his number, number
[SPEAKER_11]: 0-7-9-0-6-7-7-1-0.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll repeat it for you if you're as high
as me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 0-7-9-0-6-7-7-1-0.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you're sending some books or a
letter of encouragement to, it's
[SPEAKER_11]: T-E-N-S-A-S Parish.
[SPEAKER_11]: T-E-N-S-A-S Parish, P-A-R-I-S-H,
P-A-R-I-S-H.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did I say that right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm reading it, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_11]: T-E-N-S-A-S Parish Detention Center.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's spelled C-E-N-T-R-E because it's in
Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_11]: They spell shit silly there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 8606 Highway 65, Waterproof,
Louisiana, which is L-A.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the zip code is 71375.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will try to remember to tweet that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm writing a note to tweet that.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, sorry, that took a second to
write the note.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can send letters of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can send him all kinds of letters.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't send him anything fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a prison.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, be smart, please.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can send him letters.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can send him anything that he might
want to read.
[SPEAKER_11]: Help him out, pass the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mark continues and he says,
my understanding is that I'll be dropped
[SPEAKER_11]: off ultimately at the border in Windsor,
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking sometime between August 10th
and August 25th.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a month after his release date.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have no way of knowing for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd think that would be a
straightforward process, taking a few days
[SPEAKER_11]: at most.
[SPEAKER_11]: But LaSalle is a for-profit, GEO-group
detention center and thus they're making
[SPEAKER_11]: money for every day I am there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And because the Canadian government is
involved, these bureaucrats have a
[SPEAKER_11]: tendency to be slower than they ought to
be.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I may need your help in providing
motivation for them to repatriate me back
[SPEAKER_11]: to Canada on a more reasonable and timely
schedule.
[SPEAKER_11]: The former Canadian Conrad, Conrad Black
got out of Coleman Federal Prison in
[SPEAKER_11]: Florida last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was driven straight forward to Miami
and able to go immediately to Toronto on a
[SPEAKER_11]: flight with his wife, Barbara Amiel.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was extraordinarily not the least of
which because Conrad Black is not even a
[SPEAKER_11]: Canadian citizen anymore and it has never
happened to any other Canadian in U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: prison.
[SPEAKER_11]: No doubt his friendship with former Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney and others got him
[SPEAKER_11]: an instant express immigration approval
back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it shows a clear unfairness that a man
who renounced his Canadian citizenship so
[SPEAKER_11]: he could be Lord in the British House of
Commons gets treatment far beyond what any
[SPEAKER_11]: actual Canadian citizen like myself
currently receives from the Canadian
[SPEAKER_11]: government.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I say like myself because that's what
Mark wrote, I am not Canadian.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm an American.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm from California, but I'm from Colorado
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get no connections in the high places,
long drawn out delayed route to an
[SPEAKER_11]: unceremonious drop off in Windsor,
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_11]: At that, not even to my home in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Mark writes strangely in long
sentences and I'm high.
[SPEAKER_11]: No cushy flight for me back to the airport
of my choice alongside my wife like
[SPEAKER_11]: Conrad.
[SPEAKER_11]: My point being, if they could get
non-Canadian Conrad's paperwork ready in
[SPEAKER_11]: advance to get to Toronto immediately upon
his U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: federal prison release, they could have
mine ready too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last I checked, I am still a Canadian
citizen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So then Jodi updated, she says,
July 11th update.
[SPEAKER_11]: The following information is not
completely accurate because Mark is not at
[SPEAKER_11]: LaSalle.
[SPEAKER_11]: He is at Kansas Parish Detention Facility.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay tuned for updates as they come.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then Mark continues, at any rate,
once I arrived at LaSalle, I will be given
[SPEAKER_11]: an alien number and Jodi will update this
blog to indicate what my A number is.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you see my A number in this blog,
I've been told that you can actually send
[SPEAKER_11]: me messages over the phone or by calling a
phone number, which is no good anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I won't even bother reading it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The receptionist will deliver messages.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I got to skip all this because he
says I buy phone cards and I can call out
[SPEAKER_11]: without limits on phone time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not quite a prison.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but he's not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: He says, I'm done with my official U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: sentence, but I still can't leave until
they take me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's purgatory of sorts.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I get my A number, I am also assigned
my deportation officer.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will fill out my temporary passport
information, have my photo taken.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll fill out my forms and my deportation
officer fills in his part.
[SPEAKER_11]: And afterwards it's onto the Canadian
Consul in Dallas, Texas, to a fellow by
[SPEAKER_11]: the name of David Martinez.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once I am at LaSalle, Jodi will post that
phone number here, which she can't do
[SPEAKER_11]: because he, of course, didn't make it
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the communication between LaSalle
and the Canadian Consul in Dallas,
[SPEAKER_11]: who liaisons to his boss in Ottawa,
is done electronically.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that ought to be done quickly,
that is within days.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm certain that, uh, British actors
in Ottawa could choose to be deliberately
[SPEAKER_11]: slow, lazy, or obstructive simply because
it's me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Harper government is hardly eager
to have me back in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is where many supporters can
influence events, should this procedure
[SPEAKER_11]: get unduly tardy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I may need all of you to call one of those
three locations, or all three locations,
[SPEAKER_11]: for several hours a day, urging an end to
any questionable delays, if they should
[SPEAKER_11]: happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just be ready to help if you are so
inclined.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once the government paperwork is completed
and my temporary passport is done,
[SPEAKER_11]: the INS people at LaSalle merely need to
book my flight, then take me to
[SPEAKER_11]: Alexandria, Louisiana, and fly me to
Detroit, Michigan, and escort me over the
[SPEAKER_11]: border point into Windsor, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, many U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: imprisoned Canadians have waited weeks for
their flights to be booked because the
[SPEAKER_11]: prisons make more money the longer we are
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, let us be optimistic and
hope that a big campaign to urge my speedy
[SPEAKER_11]: return will prove to be unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is getting a little long.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only a little bit more,
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for paying attention.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Mark Emery we're talking about,
so it's worth listening to.
[SPEAKER_11]: At this facility, we don't get outside
much, but I can buy items from the
[SPEAKER_11]: commissary daily.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't take anything with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's just talking about the place he
thinks he's going to, which I won't even
[SPEAKER_11]: read it because he didn't get to go there.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to send me anything to help me
get comfortable, comfortable upon my
[SPEAKER_11]: arrival, and during my hopefully short
stay, you can use your credit card to send
[SPEAKER_11]: me $20 or $30 to help pay for my phone
calls, and I'll thank you all.
[SPEAKER_11]: And by food and clothes, refer to my A
number, refer my name and A number.
[SPEAKER_11]: When he gets Jody, he'll post it.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's done that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've read that part.
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe only U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: credit cards will work, but I hope the
Canadian credit cards will be okay too
[SPEAKER_11]: because that's all Jody has.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when this guy's in, he's out of prison
and he's still locked up and still in
[SPEAKER_11]: prison, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: The prison he was in was much better than
where they're putting it now for this
[SPEAKER_11]: temporary time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's got to fucking deal with that shit
after he's supposed to be out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he says, when I'm finally placed on the
plane to Alexandria, Louisiana and flown
[SPEAKER_11]: to Detroit, I will be met by two U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: Marshals and then driven through a tunnel
to Windsor, Ontario, Canadian Customs and
[SPEAKER_11]: Immigration Office.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope I will have enough advance notice
to call Jody and have her fly standby to
[SPEAKER_11]: Toronto from Vancouver, then get to
Windsor to be there waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you live in the Windsor area,
I hope to see you there also.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's inviting you Canadians out.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're in Windsor and when Mark gets
out and you're in the Windsor area,
[SPEAKER_11]: he hopes to see you there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So follow Jody on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter.com slash Jody Emory for regular
updates because that's where she posts
[SPEAKER_11]: most of the stuff online.
[SPEAKER_11]: We will have an impromptu gathering
somewhere Windsor after my arrival.
[SPEAKER_11]: And within 12 hours, I will take the train
or some transport to Toronto where we will
[SPEAKER_11]: have another party at Vapor Central.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I will give a talk the following
evening there too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Other venues for meeting people will
surely be planned and announced,
[SPEAKER_11]: but everything will be done short notice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So stay tuned for news alerts.
[SPEAKER_11]: He keeps going, he keeps going.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he says, I want to close this final
prison blog with a sincere thank you to
[SPEAKER_11]: our supporters, which is myself and you
guys who have been listening to the show,
[SPEAKER_11]: who helped in so many ways during these
long years of my incarceration.
[SPEAKER_11]: Jody and I appreciate everything you've
done for us both and the movement and
[SPEAKER_11]: large in my absence.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait to get home and thank you all
in person in the weeks and months ahead
[SPEAKER_11]: and resume the unfinished battle to finish
off marijuana prohibition with renewed
[SPEAKER_11]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you'll be there with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this dude's getting out of prison.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been in prison for five years.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many days did we say?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's up at the top.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was 1,590 days.
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus whatever time, we're going to add
another 30 or so days onto that,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So this dude's been in there for 1,600
days and he wants to get out and get back
[SPEAKER_11]: on the fucking streets and start battling
for cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a diehard motherfucker right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he going to be drug tested?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you said he's headed to Vapor
Central or the Vapor Lounge.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he going to be able to puff?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he going to be able to dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man, imagine being in prison for six
years and taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll rock your world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Emery is going to be high.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's give a big shout out to Mark
Emery.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wish him the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can afford to send him something
with your credit card, please do so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get up on Jody Emery's Twitter.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can't send him money, you can send
him a letter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will tweet the address.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wrote down a note to do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So support Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's done a lot for you, even if you don't
know it.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a pot smoker, if you're a pot
grower, if you're a pot supporter,
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Emery is part of your team.
[SPEAKER_11]: You should be helping him out now.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's our turn to return the favor.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've done a 50 minute episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's wrap up the news.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't usually turn off the recording
to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's just keep it going.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take a sip right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are we going to hit?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got some lemon Jeffrey dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody knows I've got the lemon Jeffrey
dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my secret stash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to bust off a little lemon
Jeffrey dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm using my highly educated carb cap.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bust off a nice size chunky dab here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which rig do we want to hit?
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to hit the, I'm going to use the
Eric Ross 4.0 prototype with the highly
[SPEAKER_11]: educated duality nail, the domeless.
[SPEAKER_11]: So take a dab with me guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys got some dabs of something,
dude, if you got some live resin,
[SPEAKER_11]: smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm addicted to, I don't want to say
addicted because I'm not addicted to it,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I don't even have any of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love some live resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the new shit right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not smoking live resin,
if you haven't tried that yet,
[SPEAKER_11]: you got to try some of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to find one of the, one of the
guys in the in-crowd, get you some live
[SPEAKER_11]: resin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Spantz.
[SPEAKER_11]: He dabbed me out with that live resin on
710 and that stuff was delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just talking while I'm heating up
the nail.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting hot.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do a dab with me guys.

[SPEAKER_11]: I obviously can't breathe from the dab
that I just took.
[SPEAKER_11]: So give me a second to take a drink and
I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll read some news and we will get on
with it with a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hang out, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I've recovered from those dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a nice drink of water.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got nice and comfortable.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to read you a news article that
comes from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually written in the cannabis
again from our good friend, Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_11]: The headline is Edibles Recall.
[SPEAKER_11]: At home baked use of washing machine for
hash questioned.
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, the popular Denver based brand of
marijuana infused edibles was recalled by
[SPEAKER_11]: Denver Department of Environmental Health
on July 17th because of the possible
[SPEAKER_11]: contamination from unsanitary equipment
and use of equipment not intended for food
[SPEAKER_11]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_11]: According to the department's public
health inspections division, the
[SPEAKER_11]: manufacturer of the recalled edibles at
home baked operates on the same state
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana license as dispensary group
advanced medical alternatives.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're really frustrated with the entire
situation, said AJ Ashkar.
[SPEAKER_11]: AJ Ashkar, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's also known to me as AJ Hashman.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I would always call him.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, I saw Ashkar and I just said
Hashkar because it seemed like it worked.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, the coroner of at home baked
who is known in the Denver marijuana
[SPEAKER_11]: industry as AJ Hashman.
[SPEAKER_11]: They came in and the machine which we were
utilizing to make water hash was not a
[SPEAKER_11]: food safe machine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Food safe machines to make water hash do
not exist.
[SPEAKER_11]: They deemed the water hash that we were
making unfit for human consumption,
[SPEAKER_11]: even though nobody has gotten sick from
our hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Department of Environmental Health
verified that there haven't been any
[SPEAKER_11]: reports of illness yet, but a food safety
inspection was the reason for the recall.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ashkar has been using a modified washing
machine to activate his water hash,
[SPEAKER_11]: a common practice in this industry to get
the centrifugal action that is essential
[SPEAKER_11]: to the water hash, said Ashkar,
also known for his popular marijuana meet
[SPEAKER_11]: and greets in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, AJ throws some great parties.
[SPEAKER_11]: He hasn't been able to do them anymore
because the Denver police have actually
[SPEAKER_11]: been shutting those parties down because
we're smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, the article says my business
partner and I both have culinary
[SPEAKER_11]: backgrounds, food service backgrounds,
and we look at water hash as a
[SPEAKER_11]: concentrate, not a food, Ashkar said.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they say as soon as you start working
with it, with a food as the intent or the
[SPEAKER_11]: end result, it is food, which I kind of
agree with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's got to be food.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to eat that hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the active ingredient that we're
searching for.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's got to be clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be food grade.
[SPEAKER_11]: In June, Ashkar received a variance from
the state through September to find a food
[SPEAKER_11]: safe alternative, and he purchased a
bubble magic machine he hopes will satisfy
[SPEAKER_11]: their regulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, the state demanded that
he recall all products made in his old
[SPEAKER_11]: washing machine.
[SPEAKER_11]: At-home baked products were recalled on
July 17th.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, let me reread that sentence for
you.
[SPEAKER_11]: The at-home baked products that were
recalled on July 17th include its infused
[SPEAKER_11]: brownie mixes, blondie mixes, rice krispie
treats, and sticks candy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm fired up on this episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going really fast because I want to
get to that grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_11]: He continues to say, please pull our
products off your shelf and place in the
[SPEAKER_11]: back room and contact me to replace them.
[SPEAKER_11]: At-Home Baked published on its Facebook on
July 16th.
[SPEAKER_11]: So sorry for the inconvenience.
[SPEAKER_11]: We look forward to restocking you ASAP
once we have more info and a timeframe.
[SPEAKER_11]: At-Home Baked will replace all products in
question or refund purchase, as Ashkar
[SPEAKER_11]: said.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Department of Environmental Health is
saying that any of the above at-home baked
[SPEAKER_11]: products should be removed from the retail
shelves and destroyed immediately pursuant
[SPEAKER_11]: to state medical and retail marijuana
products.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what does this mean for at-home baked
business?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an extremely difficult blow,
Ashkar said.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be difficult to keep our head above
water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, that's rough times for AJ Hashman and
the at-home baked company.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give a big shout out to AJ.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been a huge supporter of this
community.
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually threw those meet and greets
like they were talking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to an event in Colorado,
AJ has got a booth there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're giving out sticks.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're giving out free samples.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's done a lot for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when he does get his products back on
the shelf, somebody, one of the
[SPEAKER_11]: dispensaries needs to send them over to
Steep Hill Halent Labs, get them tested,
[SPEAKER_11]: get the profile printed out, post that
online.
[SPEAKER_11]: Show what he's got going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we should all go buy those if
it's a good product again.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should support AJ to help him get
back on his feet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is a big blow for a small
company like what AJ has got going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to make the news real quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only one news article this week
because I want to get to the Grow Lesson.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have got quite a bit of information that
I want to kind of cram into just a little
[SPEAKER_11]: bit of time here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm scrolling through my notes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And before we do that, I need to give
another shout out.
[SPEAKER_11]: This portion of the podcast, The Grow
Lesson, is brought to you by Hygro Indoor
[SPEAKER_11]: Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beech
Street, Unit F, or stop by the new Pueblo
[SPEAKER_11]: location on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_11]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget to check out www.hygrodenver
.com for current store hours and special
[SPEAKER_11]: sales.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go check out the new location in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell them Ross, they like to know that I'm
sending people and that means they know
[SPEAKER_11]: you're listening to the podcast and knows
their advertising dollars are going the
[SPEAKER_11]: right direction.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's get down to a Grow
Lesson.
[SPEAKER_11]: A few weeks ago, we cut some clones,
we germinated seeds, and then we put those
[SPEAKER_11]: seedlings and clones into cups to let them
develop roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's probably on the time schedule I've
been on, it's probably past time to get
[SPEAKER_11]: those into pots and start the vegetative
phase.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I apologize if I'm a little behind
schedule.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had a lot of podcasting to try to
cram in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, let's talk about the size pots
we're going to use.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to go straight into the pots that
I'm going to finish in.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I transplant into now from the cups
is going to be our finished pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were in cups.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go into pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Using your pot size is an important thing
to consider.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to run my test plants in three
gallon pots and my big plants in seven
[SPEAKER_11]: gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of you guys like to go even bigger,
but for an indoor crop, I think a seven
[SPEAKER_11]: gallon pot is plenty large enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're going outside, shit,
you can go 50 to 100 or I've seen 200 and
[SPEAKER_11]: 50 gallon pots outside, earth pots,
but if you're going that big, you should
[SPEAKER_11]: just go into the ground, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I think I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three to five gallon pots are great for
vegging plants for a few weeks and then
[SPEAKER_11]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like to let them veg in three
gallon pots for longer than like 45 days
[SPEAKER_11]: or so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once the plants start to get too big for
that, they'll get a little bit root bound.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to veg your plants for more
time to get bigger plants and bigger buds,
[SPEAKER_11]: use larger pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I want to run a fast crop, I run about
16 three gallon pots under a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_11]: lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are usually from seed if I'm running
like a little tester crop is what I do
[SPEAKER_11]: that for.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm running a production crop,
I'll put between four and six seven gallon
[SPEAKER_11]: pots under a thousand watt lot,
depending on the strain.
[SPEAKER_11]: If they get taller and thinner,
I'll put six of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're like bushy or plants like I'll
say the Grateful Dog, I'll only put four.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lemon Jeffery, I'll put six.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just kind of because the Lemon Jeffery
gets taller than it does wide,
[SPEAKER_11]: so I'll put six of them under there and
pull a pretty nice harvest, about a pound
[SPEAKER_11]: and a half from six Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can get that pound and a half from four
of them, but I have to let it veg just a
[SPEAKER_11]: little bit longer, maybe like two weeks
more.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the difference in the pot size and
the veg times and how many pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where you start doing that kind of
math.
[SPEAKER_11]: Both of these methods will harvest me
about a pound, pound and a half if done
[SPEAKER_11]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_11]: The smaller plants take less time to veg,
but I like the production from a seven
[SPEAKER_11]: gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_11]: They seem like they're able to grow more.
[SPEAKER_11]: When they have a bigger root ball,
they just seem to take off.
[SPEAKER_11]: They grow larger in flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: They seem like they keep growing a little
bit taller.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't cut off as early in their
growth phase in flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also limited by plant count,
so a fewer larger pots is better for the
[SPEAKER_11]: medical growers.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have a small grow space,
of course, use smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have room for larger pots,
go for the larger pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can experiment and see what and why
and how it all works best for your needs
[SPEAKER_11]: and your environment, how much herb you
need, how often you need it, what strains
[SPEAKER_11]: are going to grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are all things that are going to
decide this stuff for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have access to a good grow supply
store, then I recommend starting with
[SPEAKER_11]: something like roots organic, sunshine mix
number four, something similar to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all great starters.
[SPEAKER_11]: I use a recycled and amended soil mix that
can get a little complex and it can make
[SPEAKER_11]: it hard to diagnose problems if one comes
up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I recommend learning with the basic soil
and organic bottled nutrients unless you
[SPEAKER_11]: have experience with farming,
horticulture, composting or some kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: soil or plant education.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you understand the basics of the
plants, we can make a super soil mix and
[SPEAKER_11]: work on eliminating the bottle feeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: For now, let's keep it simple and develop
a good understanding of these plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where we want to start.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've got some soil, you got some
pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we've got some small plants that are
in cups.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get those babies into the big girl
pots and then we'll talk about feeding for
[SPEAKER_11]: the vegetation phase.
[SPEAKER_11]: So having the little babies in cups is
really going to help out and make it easy
[SPEAKER_11]: to transplant.
[SPEAKER_11]: I fill my pots with soil and I pack it in
there slightly tight.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just press it down with my hands and I
don't pack it so tightly that the roots
[SPEAKER_11]: can't dig through, but I do want to pack
it tightly enough to where the plant's
[SPEAKER_11]: going to have plenty of support once I
bury that root ball in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: If the soil's packed too lightly,
you'll know because as soon as you water,
[SPEAKER_11]: the water's just going to run right
through the dirt and the soil's going to
[SPEAKER_11]: cave in and then you'll have to refill in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, fill your pots about two
inches from the top or more for bigger
[SPEAKER_11]: pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to save some space for watering.
[SPEAKER_11]: A seven gallon pot will take a gallon of
water or more and that needs some space in
[SPEAKER_11]: your pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a three gallon pot, you'll easily take
half a gallon up to a gallon.
[SPEAKER_11]: So save yourself some space.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I get the pot mostly full and then I
dig out about a large handful of soil out
[SPEAKER_11]: of the center of the pot.
[SPEAKER_11]: I set the cologne in the cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still in the plastic cup right now
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: I set that cup in the spot where the
cologne is going to go and I backfill the
[SPEAKER_11]: dirt around the cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: This makes a perfect little spot for the
cologne to fit without disturbing the
[SPEAKER_11]: roots.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't leave the cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I want to stress that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not leave the cup on the cologne,
only for that one second while I was
[SPEAKER_11]: making an indention.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't leave the cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: I only use it to make a little space for
the cologne.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once I've got the perfect little space in
there, made for my cologne, I pull that
[SPEAKER_11]: cup out with the cologne in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I hold the cup upside down with
my hand on top of the cup with the cologne
[SPEAKER_11]: coming out between my middle and ring
finger and I flip the cup upside down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_11]: I give it a little squeeze and then I
usually could just squeeze it and shake it
[SPEAKER_11]: until the cologne slides out of the cup.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then try not to disturb the roots and
that soil ball that come right out of
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just shake it and it'll come out and set
that little soil ball perfectly into that
[SPEAKER_11]: perfect little spot that we just made.
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be the same shape as the cup
since you just make it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just set it right down in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: When the cup comes off, there'll be dirt
falling out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll seem chaotic and messy, but just
stay calm.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can drop dirt and shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just don't drop the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just focus on getting that tiny little
root ball into that hole that we just
[SPEAKER_11]: made.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now you've taken your cup, you flipped
it upside down.
[SPEAKER_11]: That little baby plant's falling out.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got a handful of dirt.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're holding your new fucking life right
there in your hand.
[SPEAKER_11]: You set it in that, like, remember that
little toy you used to have when you were
[SPEAKER_11]: a kid?
[SPEAKER_11]: You had to put the little peg into the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what you want to do, just set it right
in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you got to get some dirt and put
it over the top of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just get it like a small handful of soil
and I drop it over the top of the whole
[SPEAKER_11]: plant, like right where, not the whole
plant, but all the soil, right where I
[SPEAKER_11]: just put the new freshly planted plant and
all around the rest to kind of level it
[SPEAKER_11]: out so that you just kind of camouflage
where the spot was.
[SPEAKER_11]: You kind of just want to blend it in.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want all that to become one spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I press it down just tightly enough to
hold the plant upright and carefully label
[SPEAKER_11]: your newly potted plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Label it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sucks having a plant that's not
labeled.
[SPEAKER_11]: If the cup was well labeled, also leave
that cup in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way if your label comes off,
the cup is still in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes that helps.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes I just use the cup, but once in
a while I knock the cup out and they get
[SPEAKER_11]: confused.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that sucks.
[SPEAKER_11]: So once I've got that potted, I set it
under the light and I keep working until
[SPEAKER_11]: all of my new babies are in pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once everything is potted is when I'll
feed them and make sure to get the pots
[SPEAKER_11]: thoroughly wet.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you've got to crop a freshly
transplanted babies under the lights.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now that's pretty much the beginning
of the vegetative growth phase.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's time to mix up some nutrients and
feed them their first full veg nutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a soil grower, so I pretty much focus
on a dirt garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're running a hydro garden,
we're going to have to get a hydro guy on
[SPEAKER_11]: the show here in the future and have him
teach you guys some stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's feed our new babies.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a new grower, I recommend mixing
your nutrients in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_11]: Use an accurate measuring device for your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: I use the shot glass that has milliliters
and stuff marked on it for small
[SPEAKER_11]: applications.
[SPEAKER_11]: For larger stuff, there's a pint glass
that is marked with milliliters and a few
[SPEAKER_11]: other measurements.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can find those at your local hydro
shop.
[SPEAKER_11]: I found a half gallon pitcher that fits
perfectly into my five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've learned to mix my nutrients into that
pitcher and add that to the bucket instead
[SPEAKER_11]: of mixing my nutrients directly into a
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to pour out five gallons.
[SPEAKER_11]: gallons of water when you mess up mixing
your nutrient feed.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of water to pour down the
drain.
[SPEAKER_11]: So fill your pitcher three quarters of the
way with water, add your nutrients of
[SPEAKER_11]: choice to the pitcher.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would use a good base nutrient,
a good root inoculant, and some good
[SPEAKER_11]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Specifically, I would use 50 milliliters
of botanic care pure blend pro veg soil
[SPEAKER_11]: formula as my base.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would use OGT or great white shark as my
mycos, which is your inoculant.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would use 15 milliliters of
hygrozyme as my enzymes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in my garden, I would add a little bit
of liquid karma and a few other
[SPEAKER_11]: supplements, but they're not required.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had sweet to feed my beneficials.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had vitamin O for extra vitamins and
amino acids and vitamin B also.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what else do I add in there?
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like I added something else.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're not looking to spend,
if you're not looking to spend the extra
[SPEAKER_11]: bucks, those aren't required, but I like
to spoil my plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: After about a week, or during the next
week, I'll feed Cal Mag and potassium
[SPEAKER_11]: silicates.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I run most of the botanic care
pure blend pro line when I run bottled
[SPEAKER_11]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: Botanic care is not a sponsor,
but I've been most satisfied with botanic
[SPEAKER_11]: care and organic care more than any other
bottle feed.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_11]: I ran advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've ran the aurora soil synthetics,
which produce some super tasty products.
[SPEAKER_11]: I ran psycho, which was probably not my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've ran a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've ran the Fox Farms basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've done a lot of feeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've done so many, I can't even remember
them all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, you can find a pretty good
pre-made botanic care feed chart on their
[SPEAKER_11]: website.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try to remember to post some of my
notes on the feeding programs for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody tweet me and remind me at
iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got this paper here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully that'll remind me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get back on focus a little bit and
talk about mixing stuff up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mix up your bottled feeds in a small
container of water, but don't ever mix
[SPEAKER_11]: your nutrients together without plenty of
water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't pour like a shot glass, the
measuring device.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't pour the veg stuff and then don't
pour enzymes into the same shot glass at
[SPEAKER_11]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mix those to water.
[SPEAKER_11]: The bottled stuff is sold in separate
bottles to prevent bonding of specific
[SPEAKER_11]: elements.
[SPEAKER_11]: So always mix into water.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once your pitcher is mixed, put that into
the five gallon bucket and fill it up the
[SPEAKER_11]: rest of the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once the bucket's full, you need to adjust
the pH of your feed solution.
[SPEAKER_11]: Adjust your pH to 6.5 using pH down.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unlikely that your pH is too low.
[SPEAKER_11]: And make sure you calibrate your pH meters
frequently.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you got a bucket full of nutrient
solution that has been pH adjusted to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got our freshly transplanted babies
under a light.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next thing we got to do is pour the
feed into the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, oh, I hope you've got some type of
saucer or something under to catch the
[SPEAKER_11]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Runoff under your plants also,
like sit your plants in a saucer or a
[SPEAKER_11]: tray.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't have something like that,
sometimes I use a, I've got a Rubbermaid
[SPEAKER_11]: tray that'll fit three, three gallon pots
in there perfectly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can just pour water into the plants
and then it'll drain right into there.
[SPEAKER_11]: If not, you're going to end up with water
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you need something to catch the runoff
that comes out of your plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I kind of use the pitcher that I'm
using to stir up the solution before I go
[SPEAKER_11]: right to the plants and try to mix up the
water a little bit, stir up the stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always a good idea to stir everything
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes if I'm using a big batch,
sometimes I mix my nutrients into a much
[SPEAKER_11]: larger batch.
[SPEAKER_11]: I throw an air stone in there to pump it
up a little bit to aerate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then while it's doing that,
I also use a big stick like the kind that
[SPEAKER_11]: you'd use to support your plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: I use that to stir the water up.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just seems to be effective.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like stirring it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: So mix it up a little bit, then simply
pour about a third of a gallon of water of
[SPEAKER_11]: the feed into each plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're using larger pots, you're going
to need more, you know, if the soil
[SPEAKER_11]: settles, then you need to add more water.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll notice pretty quickly if it like
crumbles down in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we add the water, all the air space
is going to get pushed out.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to, yeah, the dirt's going to
move around.
[SPEAKER_11]: You may have to adjust some of your plants
and some of the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: So water everything and refill any pots
that you need to fill with soil and get
[SPEAKER_11]: the plants under good lights.
[SPEAKER_11]: T5 lights are good for veg if you have
enough of them close to the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Metal halides are also ideal for veg
growth.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to focus on getting those pots
full of roots right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the blue spectrum is kind of what we
want.
[SPEAKER_11]: LEDs seem to be really good for veg
plants, but I personally don't have any
[SPEAKER_11]: experience with the LEDs, but I have seen
some great photographs coming from an LED
[SPEAKER_11]: garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shout out to Nancy Budwell.
[SPEAKER_11]: She's growing some bounty killer right now
and it looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So try to keep your veg area around 72 to
77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're using CO2, you can let it get a
little bit warmer, maybe low 80s during
[SPEAKER_11]: the light period.
[SPEAKER_11]: During your dark cycle, try to keep them
about the same temp or no more than 10
[SPEAKER_11]: degrees cooler than your daytime
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_11]: Try to keep your humidity around 40 to
55%, if possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Colorado, it gets hard to keep the
rooms humid.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they get dry here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, you'd rather have it too dry
than too humid if you have the option.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can't get it right where you want
it, if your blowers are messed up and not
[SPEAKER_11]: the way you need them to be, if you can't
correct it, I understand you're growing in
[SPEAKER_11]: a house.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd rather have it too dry than too
moist, if you've got the option.
[SPEAKER_11]: So also remember to keep your air fresh.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want stale, stuffy air in your
grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_11]: Your plants need plenty of CO2 and they
deplete the CO2 in a room very quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Having stale air in a grow room can lead
to powdery milking.
[SPEAKER_11]: It slows down the growth of your plants
quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I keep my vegging plants under 24 hours
of light.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they grow more quickly under 24
hours of light than they do with a dark
[SPEAKER_11]: cycle during veg.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most books will tell you to run a 16-hour
day period and an 8-hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's great because it's how nature
works and you can't argue with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've experimented with both.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes if I'm running a seed crop,
I will run a 16-hour light cycle and then
[SPEAKER_11]: go to a 12-12 cycle.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes I will run an 11-13 cycle,
which is odd, but we'll talk about that
later.
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned that from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that 16-8 light cycle is great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, it's how nature works.
[SPEAKER_11]: It also lets your equipment cool down and
take a little bit of a break.
[SPEAKER_11]: It lets your electricity bill chill out
for a second.
[SPEAKER_11]: It lets your meter quit spinning.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as long as your vegging plants are
under 16 hours of light every day,
[SPEAKER_11]: they should be happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do another show with more info on
light cycles and for a photo period later
[SPEAKER_11]: on.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I've really noticed is that when
I flip my plants to 12-12 to flower from
[SPEAKER_11]: this 24-hour light cycle, they show flower
faster than the plants that had a dark
[SPEAKER_11]: cycle during veg.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just one thing I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're really looking for a
production crop, that's something to keep
[SPEAKER_11]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: Since I just remembered that that's kind
of what inspired that for me, I think I
[SPEAKER_11]: might switch back.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also like to keep my mother plants
under 12-12 just to keep them from even
[SPEAKER_11]: thinking that they may have the chance to
flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once they get root-bound and stuff,
sometimes some of your mother plants may
[SPEAKER_11]: try to auto flower on you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got our babies in new pots.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we fed them.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're under good lights.
[SPEAKER_11]: I put a fan lightly blowing over the
canopy to keep the air circulating.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the temps and the humidity are
correct in the room, the plants won't need
[SPEAKER_11]: water for three or four days if you
watered them enough right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a good time to start thinking
about pest management.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have neem oil on hand, give each
plant a good spray when the lights turn
[SPEAKER_11]: off.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to spray them when the
lights are on.
[SPEAKER_11]: That creates what I call little reflector
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_11]: From the bubbles that land on your plant,
the light hits it, just like a magnifying
[SPEAKER_11]: glass did when you were a little kid and
used to cook ants.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll happen to your plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: The grow light will work as the sun.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the bubble will work like a magnifying
glass.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll get a little burn mark,
a little white spot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So spray when the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Always try to spray when the lights are
off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any book will tell you that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Neem will keep most of your pests away.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you're in flower, you'll need to
rethink the neem because you do not want
[SPEAKER_11]: to spray neem on your flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll taste terrible.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you make concentrates with neem sprayed
plants, oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you make concentrates with neem sprayed
plants, you can definitely taste the neem.
[SPEAKER_11]: So once you're in flower, stop spraying
neem.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a new product I'm testing out.
[SPEAKER_11]: If it works for me, I'm definitely going
to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all organic.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was recommended to me by somebody in
the horticulture industry, not the
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's used for food crops.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's completely safe.
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't smell bad.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I used it, I'm kind of testing it out
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let you know what I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're now officially in the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feed bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm using bottle nutrients,
I only feed them once per week with plain
[SPEAKER_11]: pH water throughout the rest of the week.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I personally feed all my plants on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you guys are listening to this on
Monday, I'm probably waiting for the
[SPEAKER_11]: lights to come on.
[SPEAKER_11]: The flower room comes on at 10.
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll click on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will actually have my nutrients mixed up
already.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll start doing that about 9.30.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Monday.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to get fed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think these plants are in, they're going
to start week five today.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll start mixing up their week five
stuff, get the pH adjusted in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'll throw some air stones in
there and let that stuff just bubble
[SPEAKER_11]: around and let the nutrients mingle for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then as soon as lights come on,
I'll go in there and feed them.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll need to water again, usually by
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_11]: And once they get heavier into flower,
it may step up to Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: They won't go as long.
[SPEAKER_11]: So think about how tall you can let your
plants get.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something you got to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about how tall your plants can get.
[SPEAKER_11]: Think about if you want to top them or let
them grow naturally because your plants,
[SPEAKER_11]: some sativa plants can double in size
during flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if you're growing the bounty killer,
that thing is going to double in size
[SPEAKER_11]: during your flower period.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's time to think about how tall and
wide your plants can get before you need
[SPEAKER_11]: to flower them out because that is going
to be the next major phase of your plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to let them veg.
[SPEAKER_11]: You probably got another month to 45,
maybe two months if you want to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I recommend about 30 days veg time
from here out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't get any bugs.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't burn them with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take good care of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that gets us basically started
through the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_11]: I plan to go in depth with each of these
little topics in the future.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll make little branches from everything
that I've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to get everybody up to speed with
the basics before we go too deeply into
[SPEAKER_11]: specific stuff about growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got tons of information to share with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want more details on anything I
mentioned, please just ask me because I
[SPEAKER_11]: would love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to elaborate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tweet me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's at iGrowCulture, Facebook me at
iGrowCulture on Facebook or send me an
[SPEAKER_11]: email.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I say that all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will answer almost anything you ask.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love to just interact with my social
media people.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like that was a lot of talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to freshen up my throat here,
probably take a dab.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be right back and we will see
what else we got for this show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hang tight.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to wrap the show up right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You tend to listen to more of the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I put out a 30 minute episode,
it gets a better response.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_11]: search for iGrowCulture, find the review
section, give me a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_11]: After that, type in a little comment and
let me know what you think of the podcast
[SPEAKER_11]: and I will read your comments on the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the interaction.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget that the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, Swell.am, and also every
[SPEAKER_11]: episode is available on
iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to go back and listen to
old episodes that aren't available on
[SPEAKER_11]: iTunes or Stitcher, all you got to do is
go to www.iregeneticscolorado.com and you
[SPEAKER_11]: can click on the podcast tab right there
and every episode should be available.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big thanks to Adam.
[SPEAKER_11]: Adam came and hung out with me for a
little while and watched me record part of
[SPEAKER_11]: the show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Big shout out to everybody that helped me
