[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 837 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got another great episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds, hang out, we'll talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about those free seeds later on in the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to start by sending a big thank
you shout out to everybody who checked on
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not put out an episode in two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people have sent messages
asking if I'm okay, if the podcast is
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes, we are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Vegas for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see my favorite band to fish at
the sphere for four nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sphere was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great trip and I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to everybody who checked on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am back ready to put out a great
podcast episode for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, big thanks to everybody who
checked on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do want to cordially invite you to
get locked in and get that hotel locked in
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can come hang out at the Dude Grows
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I do want to let you know that for
the month of May, I have put all regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds on blowout pricing at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like regular seeds, I highly
recommend you check iredirect.com for
[SPEAKER_00]: blowout pricing on regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds will be on sale for the month of
May, but act quickly because many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will sell out at that price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you go check iredirect.com for
current pricing and inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to sell out very quickly,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you hit the website as soon
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've covered all of the
advertising here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to talk about the most
popular topic in the cannabis world this
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that is that the DEA has
now announced that they are rescheduling
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to a schedule three drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have a lot of implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the cannabis industry that could cause
a lot of changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, I do not know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could also be a very detrimental
thing for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they ban home grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they force a prescription on us for
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this crush the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this override state laws and
regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very curious to see what is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not ready to tell you anything or
report anything on this new change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we're all paying attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I understand it more, as we see how
things roll out, Mike and I will do our
[SPEAKER_00]: best to keep you updated on the changes
and what this does mean for our plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: for our industry and for our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pay attention because they have now
decided to reschedule cannabis to a class
[SPEAKER_00]: three drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else that is class three
requires a prescription and strong
[SPEAKER_00]: oversight for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could mean a lot of changes for
our community and our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to have Mike and myself
keep you guys updated on those changes and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can expect and how they will
change and affect the community and the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've got for you today on
schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to segue into the pet
peeve portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows what a pet peeve is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that just drives you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, I like to highlight a grow
room or a cannabis community pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we are going to talk about
unlabeled plants and disorganized grow
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces, disorganized mix spaces and
unorganized pesticide mix and storage
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that disorganization simply drives
me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organize your stuff, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be so much easier to work in that
grow space if you just put some things
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organize your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be more pleasurable to work in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you would just enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy a clean, tidy workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every couple of days, once I notice
that these bottles are moved around and my
[SPEAKER_00]: pH pins over here and the scissors are
over here, I'll just take a few minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: and just regroup and reorganize
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes less chaos in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't have to look for a pH pin and
look for scissors, if they're right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can spend that much more time focused on
the tasks that I do need to get done in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stuff that drives me crazy is just
the disorganization, the disorganization
[SPEAKER_00]: and the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that, I mean label your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't the plants labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant should have a clear tag in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, this was inspired by my friend
who always tells me he forgot to label a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or forgot which plant we're smoking
because he didn't write it down on the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, label your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you guys, label those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label them redundantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll put a piece of duct tape on
the pot with the name on it and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant tag inside the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes two plant tags just depends on
the process of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's label all of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're running perpetual grows,
if you've got multiple cycles in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: put the date that that plant went into
flower on the plant tag and possibly in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow journal, in a grow log, write that
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's update, organize, and try to be
more proficient in the grow by cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: everything up and being organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organize the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, organize that mix area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up that mix area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you're pouring nutrients into
your mixing containers, shaking that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: up every day, I bet there's some drops,
some dribbles that need to be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet your measuring cups need to be
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use dry amendments, dried
nutrients, I bet your scale needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweep and mop that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just clean all that stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show some pride in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that pesticide mix area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that's an important area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever your pesticides are stored,
they should be, if you're in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, those pesticides should be in
some sort of a locked container,
[SPEAKER_00]: a locked receptacle, a closet,
a cupboard, something that is locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, clean up all of those bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want pesticides dripping down
the side of the bottle when you pick it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't realize you got some on your
glove, your hand, your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where is that going to end up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pants, your hair, your face,
your food, the doorknobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's clean off those bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you pour, clean off the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that pesticide in whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up whatever you use to transfer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to clean up all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some pride in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also about efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also about safety, especially in that
pesticide mix area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another pet peeve of mine is when I ask a
grower, when was the last time you did
[SPEAKER_00]: this or when did this happen in the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not forget because I wrote it down
When is the last time you applied a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you water last?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you watered last, what was in that
mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many milliliters of each bottle went
into that mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much water did you start with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you measure the EC and pH of the
runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark all that stuff down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me crazy when people say,
I don't remember what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember either, but I wrote it
down so I can scroll back or fold back in
[SPEAKER_00]: my pages and I can look and see what is
going on in my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be more organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organize your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your space and keep some notes of
what's going on in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disorganization kind of drives me crazy,
especially in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in a grow where a grower cannot
identify a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on in here, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what have you done the past few
feedings?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to diagnose a problem if
you don't know what you have been putting
[SPEAKER_00]: into those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my pet peeve for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reorganize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it some basic love, some care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show some pride in that grow is what I
think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will wrap up the pet peeve section of
today's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a grow room or a cannabis
community pet peeve, I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me those grow room pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put pet peeve in the subject line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do read your pet peeve here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, before we segue
into the grow help portion of today's
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, please do click like and
subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you do not miss any episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it moves me up in the algorithm and we
can get a few more viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way more people can grow better
ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to work on the question
and answer portion of today's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a website on the top of that
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a list of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that grow help tab and
send me your grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I click on that grow help tab,
if I read your grow question here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
a free pack of seeds off of ireadirect
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first question came from our
friend who wants to be called,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Haji Toksalot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my new friend Toksalot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, I am new to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome to the family, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, as my state recently legalized,
congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've only grown auto flowers all
indoors and a grow tent set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will eventually try photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my research now, but I have
questions about light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a real thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where you're headed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light leaks are a real thing, but indoors
and outdoors, it is a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stick with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hear me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, there is no place that I know of
on earth where cannabis grows outside that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are not stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stars give off, give off light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm confused about light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes very good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why must I have total darkness with no
light leaks in my tent during lights out
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please explain, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna explain it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will understand very well by the time
I am done rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up with, your podcast is great
with lots of information and very
[SPEAKER_00]: informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Toksalot, thank you for the
great compliment and thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is, so there's a lot to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take me a minute to get there,
but it will all make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an outdoor environment, as the sun
sets, it begins to create a red spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun's position in the sky relative to
the atmosphere, relative to the earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: creates a red light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That red light is known as far red
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plants receive that far red
lighting, that triggers what is known as a
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome red response in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phytochrome response basically tells
those plants, hey ladies, the day is
ending.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for you to brush your teeth and
go to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those plants will start putting their
leaves down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a little bit droopy and they
will go to sleep and then they will start
[SPEAKER_00]: their nighttime processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is triggered by that phytochrome
or that far red light and the phytochrome
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will happen before the sun sets
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I do want to highlight here
is I see people saying, I've got 14 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of sunlight in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe to put my plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not absolutely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is visible light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sunshiny a little bit for 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the spectrums in which your plants are
receiving are not the proper spectrum to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that plant in a vegetative state for
a continued state of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants, if you put them out right
now, they will flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun rises in the morning,
it puts off that blue spectrum that wakes
[SPEAKER_00]: them up and tells them, hey ladies,
it's time to get the day going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it sets, that happens earlier than
you're thinking because you may have 14
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, but as it starts to set that 13th,
12th, 12th hour may have already triggered
[SPEAKER_00]: that phytochrome red response and your
plants are going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many of you see your plants
going into flower early outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's try to stay back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about why the plants do need
total darkness indoors versus outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in that phytochrome red response
happens, these plants are in much more
[SPEAKER_00]: deep sleep than the plants that you have
indoors because unless you're buying the
[SPEAKER_00]: new technology, there's only one light
that I know of that's got that far red
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're introducing that far red
lighting, it's taking much longer for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants indoors to fall asleep and just
think about it like the sun is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful light source you could ever
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot replicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the biggest light that there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to exaggerate about it,
but that's all I could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most powerful light that there
possibly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine trying to compare that to a bulb
that's indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you run that sun all day,
the plants are going, bro, I'm getting sun
[SPEAKER_00]: blasted compared to a thousand watt HPS
bulb inside your basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets dark outside, it's way dark
compared to how dark it is when it just
[SPEAKER_00]: gets dark in your basement without that
thousand watt bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants had that super, super sun
compared to your thousand watt bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of light that was hitting those
plants all day long outdoors based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light that was hitting them
indoors is drastically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got two things that will affect
the interruption of the dark cycle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: At nighttime outdoors, they've been put to
sleep by that far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're tucked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sleeping real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been Cosby'd a little bit by the
sun and told to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, they were not tucked in,
and the light that they're used to isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: super intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they do get a little bit of light,
they think it's just like the normal grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light that they normally get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think that that might actually be
the light that they're supposed to react
[SPEAKER_00]: to and photosynthesize for and schedule
themselves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's in the sun and then you get a
little like a car driving by or a
[SPEAKER_00]: flashlight passing by, it goes,
no, that wasn't nearly the light that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to wake up for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the far red lighting,
the phytochrome response outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we've got the drastic differences
in amount of light and intensity and
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum that make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm trying to say is that far red
light tucks your plants in and stars the
[SPEAKER_00]: moon, things like that won't interrupt the
plant because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature had that figured out, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: John knew that that was going to happen
when he made all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I got to leave a little bit of
lights on for all the people that like to
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put some stars and a moon up there,
but he's like, I can't mess up the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he put some far red lighting up there
to put those plants to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just my quick description of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, you're not getting that far red
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not getting tucked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the amount of light that is
interrupting versus the amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are used to is not very far
apart, not different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants don't know if they're
supposed to wake up or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, my friend, is why it is much more
critical to have that uninterrupted
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness indoors, that dark period than it
is outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave your comments, your questions,
and your concerns in the comments section
[SPEAKER_00]: down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to reading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude tokes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I read your question here on the
podcast, that means you win a coupon code
[SPEAKER_00]: for a free pack of seeds off of iRedirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got your email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check your spam if you don't
see the message, because by the time this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast comes out, you will have a coupon
code for a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to keep this momentum
moving before I get more tongue tied
[SPEAKER_00]: reading names.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all my Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out patreon.com
forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the bonus tiers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend Theo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Theo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question says, hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Theo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Says, I've got a quick question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've got a good answer for you,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Says, I'm going on vacation for a week,
and I'm planning on switching my photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period plants from 24 hours on and zero
hours off to 18 hours on and six hours off
[SPEAKER_00]: to help them conserve water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would there be any negatives from doing
this, like potentially initiating flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically what I do, something
similar to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go on vacation, when I go out of
town, if I know I'm going to take off,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make adjustments sort of like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first thing, though, that I want to say
is you got them on 24 hours on and zero
[SPEAKER_00]: hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always recommend giving these
plants just a few hours of darkness,
[SPEAKER_00]: four hours, five, maybe six hours of
darkness per night.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living things like a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cat and the dog obviously like a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all living things would like some
sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would give the plants a few hours,
at least four, four to six hours every
[SPEAKER_00]: night to sleep with lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of processes that happen in the root
zone happen during the nighttime process
[SPEAKER_00]: of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during that dark cycle, a lot of stuff
is happening in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very beneficial to give them some
sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plants will just look better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have ran plants on 24 hours on
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to get a little stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to look a little tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things get kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them time to sleep,
I feel like they stay stocky or bushier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look more healthy overall,
just like you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ran you for 24 hours for a week,
you'd start to look a little frazzled and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're going to save electricity on
your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four hours off, five days, you're already
saving 20 hours of kilowatts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a thousand watt light,
that will add up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice that in the electric bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I would do is I would
say, yes, immediately, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change those lights to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things that I do, I wrote down a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did go on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to go for seven days without
watering the plants, which is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic for a grower who likes to grow
and has things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was able to go away for seven
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did was the night before I went,
I defoliated very heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I topped a couple of the larger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watered excessively so there was still
water left in the trays, but not enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: drown the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my plants well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just watered heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still water left in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll buy me a day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I reduced my lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got LED lighting that I can just go
turn a knob.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned them down to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also reduced my timer to 16 hours on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plants were only getting 16 hours a
day for the amount of time that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough to keep them awake and not
let them go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for just a week it was going to be
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also reduced all of the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the fans weren't blowing around
and they're super crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will dry out the plants more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my steps were to overwater,
defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I topped a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reduced the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reduced the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually even unplugged one of my
lights because there's plenty of light in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room and I really didn't need that
light going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just slowed the plants down for a solid
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came back, everybody was super
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what you're doing, your idea
will work perfectly, but also reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: fans, reduce the intensity of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could do it, maybe overwater
them just a little tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude Theo, I hope my advice
worked for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy your vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun wherever you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope those plants look great when you
come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you check your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually check your Patreon inbox because
I'm going to send you a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds at iREDirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But check your Patreon inbox because
that's where the message is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thanks, Theo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep this party moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another good question here in
front of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from the Grow Help tab on
iREGenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my buddy, Mighty Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mighty Mike, my dude, make sure you check
your email because you've got a coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: code for a free pack of seeds at iREDirect
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mighty Mike has a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mighty question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hi Rasta Jeff, I've been an avid
listener and I can't thank you enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: all you do for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bro, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time somebody says that,
it means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It recharges me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me some fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those words do not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being part of the community
that we have established here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, wait, I don't hug my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hug your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's backwards, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a good answer for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question, this listener,
this viewer, this community member wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking, so they're asking if when
they make auto flowers, does the male or
[SPEAKER_00]: the female part of this equation need to
be the auto flower to make the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start by saying I am not an auto
flower breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never done auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not do auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends that are in the business
with me that have some of my plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are working my stuff into auto
flowers, but I am not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I help with selection, but overall that is
their project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two friends doing auto flower
projects, two different companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: love, trust and respect both of them and
fully endorse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But autos are not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'm not the auto flower
maker as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this advice is not 100% solid in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from my opinion, my breeding
experience, my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of pulling this out of my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, from my breeding
understanding, if you want to make auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower seeds, you need one auto flower
plant to begin with and that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: matter if that is the male or the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say do the male because I just
like what male plants contribute to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix and I feel more confident intuitively
telling you to use the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't believe that there would be
a difference as long as one is auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're gonna have to, as long as one
is auto flower, you should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: create auto flower progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's not going to be the first
filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say, for my advice,
you chose an auto flower male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's just say, so what I'm gonna say,
we're gonna skip you a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna save problems here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna come up with a genius idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even gonna have a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're gonna do, find an auto
flower female that you like because most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the auto flowers you buy are going to
be fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find an auto flower female that you
like, reverse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that auto flower reversed pollen on a
photoperiod female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will start the process of making
feminized auto flower plants for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that step one of reversing an
auto flower, taking that pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it on a regular plant,
you're going to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got to grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find another auto flower plant and another
auto flower plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only gonna be able to tell because
they're going to flower on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would select one of those that you
really like and reverse that one and put
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen on another auto flower female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've doubled up the possibilities,
doubled up the amount of genetics in that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The likelihood of the next filial
generation showing auto flower is much
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely if you did the selections
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna have to reverse a plant,
pollinate a plant, reverse a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate a plant, and keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually by the third or fourth time
those plants should be auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be feminized auto flower plants
if you do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do keep saying if you do it
correctly, selection is the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not an auto flower grower or
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even know what to tell you to
look for when it comes to selecting auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do know is that if you want to
move that auto flower gene and make that
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower gene a dominant trait in those
plants, you need an auto flower plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: a photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first batch is going to have some
autos and some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your autos and breed those together
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That next batch will be mostly autos and
some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find more autos and breed those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take three or four tries before
everything starts coming out auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep going and lock in the traits
you really desire if that's what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the third or fourth filial
generation you should have pretty uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenous auto flower feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, let me give a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an auto flower breeder,
auto flower smoker, auto flower grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know a lot about auto flowers,
but I do understand genetics and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: my advice should apply accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, argue in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about my auto
flower advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm completely way off, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm spot on, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm somewhere in the middle,
give me half credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pass the class, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps, toes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts out there.
