[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 844 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got another great episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on, we'll talk more about those free
seeds later on in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you that there is a
restock and new items available at
[SPEAKER_00]: ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you hit ireadirect.com for all
of the new merch, all the restocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: go see what I've been putting up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going through the vault and I've
been finding some rare items.

[SPEAKER_00]: A few Patreon members got a few free packs
of seeds this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, randomly, I did put up a sale of
the Golden Girls packs, the first 10
[SPEAKER_00]: people to see that coupon code on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the Golden Girls bundle for $70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you guys join the Patreon at
patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart to stay updated on those exclusive
drops and freebies and special deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that covers all of the
advertising I want to do here at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys love advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's segue into what I call the pet peeve
portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm sure most of you out there know
what a pet peeve is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case you don't, a pet peeve is
something that simply drives you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to talk about grow room pet peeves
here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll go to a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll go to my friends grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll see something on the
internet that simply drives me crazy as a
[SPEAKER_00]: pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm going to read a listener pet
peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something out there drives you
completely crazy, I encourage you to send
[SPEAKER_00]: me your grow room pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your peeve here on the podcast,
you will receive a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me that pet peeve at grow from your
heart at hotmail.com and put the word pet
[SPEAKER_00]: peeve in the subject line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can find them more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's pet peeve started off kind of as a
question, but I'm going to turn this into
[SPEAKER_00]: my pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from a friend who wants
to be called full throttle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from that grow help tab
on ireadigenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main website is ireadigenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of that web page, there's a
list of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs does say grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that grow help tab,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to send me your grow help
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what's going on in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what the problem is in the
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of seeds off of ireadirect
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two separate websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll talk more about that one day,
but let's stick with the point because
[SPEAKER_00]: once again, I'm super rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from that grow help tab
on ireadigenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from my new friend, full throttle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of prep to this question,
and then they get right to the point which
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump straight to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a little bit like this,
and this is also my grow room pet peeve of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've been growing since 1989,
and about three years ago, I started
[SPEAKER_00]: making feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, congratulations on the seed making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question is if I can turn a
male into a controlled hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not at all what is happening
here, so that is my pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people talk about feminizing,
making feminized seeds, when they talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about reversing and they use the word herm
in the conversation, that's a pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are breeding, making feminized
plants, making feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be zero herm word interaction
reason in this conversation at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word herm, especially hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermy isn't even a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herm is short for hermaphrodite,
which the appropriate word is intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those words should never come up when
we're talking about making femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any intersex traits in either
one of your plants when you are making
[SPEAKER_00]: femme seeds, you're already fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: More herms, more intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, my big pet peeve is when people talk
about making feminized seeds is when they
[SPEAKER_00]: say anything to do with the word herm,
especially the word hermy, that's not even
[SPEAKER_00]: a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're using the word herm in your
femme seeds, you're already doing it all
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, if I can turn a female plant
into a controlled herm to make femme
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, that is not what's happening at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain more of what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is not a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is not a male plant in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is not a hermaphrodite plant in
any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is still a fully female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we identify that plant and verify
that is that we have ran that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times in several conditions,
in several rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant shows intersex traits in
that plant, I eliminate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not breed that into my breeding mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't breed with intersex with herm
plants at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a solid, true, tested female
plant with true XX chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking that female plant and we're
reversing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing what I'm doing is I'm spraying it
with a silver solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different silver
solutions you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make my own silver thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray it with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that silver penetrates those leaves,
it creates a copper disruption in that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The copper can't move around properly
because the silver blocks that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plant says something's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that creates an ethylene response,
which is part of the ripening process in
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the fruits and vegetables which we
consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That process goes into a lot more detail
I'm not qualified to explain, which
[SPEAKER_00]: creates pollen sacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pollen sacs are all female pollen
sacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all female pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no male chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no hermaphrodite, hermy,
intersex chromosome involved in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a controlled herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're reversing it, that is what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a controlled herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the word herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pet peeve is the word herm when it
comes to femme breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the word herm is in there, you're
fucking up already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is there a spray that can turn
male plants into female flowers to make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing there is, but every seed
would be male and that's why no one does
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are chemicals, sprays, applications,
products that we can put on our male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that will allow them to show us
what they would look like as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about seed production with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tried that, but we have
reversed a male plant to look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: female before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked just like when a normal female
changes itself to look like a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could definitely tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I don't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's worth the time because
in the time it took that breeder to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse that male plant to show us what it
would look like as a girl, I took my male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and pollinated female plants with it
and now we can grow those seeds and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually made forward progress in my
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there is a chemical called
epiphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not write down the dilution and
application rates, but epiphone is
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reverse male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, what would be called,
it wouldn't be feminizing, it'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: masculizing them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could make masculine seeds if you
really wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a reason to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be shooting yourself in the
foot in my opinion, but there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: product, there is a chemical out there
that will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reverse that plant and it will
show you what it would look like as a
[SPEAKER_00]: female if you want to know what traits it
would bring to the table as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, while you're doing that
project, I'm using my male that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: already selected with visual traits that I
can rely on and I'm pollinating females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a step ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're flowering out that dude and trying
to do the tricks and do the wizardry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already making seeds that we can grow,
that we grow those seeds and those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: show me what my pollen donor plant
actually would have done in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my pet peeve, I haven't answered the
question, but my pet peeve here is stop
[SPEAKER_00]: saying herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pet peeve is the word herm when it
comes to making fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I covered all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dude, your name is on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dude, full throttle, thank you for
the great question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you do check your inbox because
you have a coupon code for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep this
momentum moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question is about pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this question came from our friend
who wants to be called Trumpicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says when you reverse a female and you
pollinate another female with that
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, makes sense so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the reversed female a male then?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a reversed female, kind of like the
previous question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a reversed female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a girl that has been treated with
silver or whatever you want to treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: with that is will cause it to reverse and
it has reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not get a gender change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got all X chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a very controversial subject
if we wanted to go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is all female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just treated it with a solution
that has caused a reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a chemical reaction is all that's
happening in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is still a true female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much so that the pollen that comes off
of that plant is true female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen that comes off, if you gather
that pollen, that is all female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how many other female plants you
put that on, it's going to make female
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds because it is all female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how truly female that plant is
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help me understand you,
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate everything that I am learning
from your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a really short answer and I
hope it makes sense and you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: win your free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is the reversed plant a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's still a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has just been treated with chemical
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't changed its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't wear different clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We simply sprayed it with some shit and
it's having a chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were a human, it would be a medical
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: A chemical reaction is all it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to do this comparison with
people and plants because this is weird
[SPEAKER_00]: when it gets to this borderline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it is still a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just sprayed it with some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was quick and straight to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dude, make sure you check your inbox
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds from irie direct dot
com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep this
momentum moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I jump into this third
question, I do want to remind you to like

[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump our way into this third
question here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, once again, this did come from
the grow help tab on my website,
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the website, irie genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top, there's that row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called skunky Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my new buddy, skunky Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, Hey Ross, did Jeff,
I appreciate everything you do for the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been following for a while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you noticed what I do for the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you see that I try to create a
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are not already
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the community, I invite everybody
out there
[SPEAKER_00]: to join me in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know who may be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be able to answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pop in show us a picture Show us a
video of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be able to help you out in real
time Give you real recommended advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be somebody in your region in
your area That's growing that has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that knows where there's a store
nearby that can help you get a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great resource I do invite you to
join us on the discord server the iry army
[SPEAKER_00]: discord server pop in that smokers lounge
Don't be shy if you don't want to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to put your face on video
If you don't want to smoke on camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to you can come be a little
blank icon It'll say whatever Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: smokes all day could be your name up there
You could just have that name displayed
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can come have a conversation with
us as much as you're confident as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're comfortable You can hang out you
can share your experience Just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that everybody feels invited to
the iry army discord server That was a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself a little bit focused
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my question is about reversing
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys know That this episode
is going to be mostly about feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding projects We're gonna jump into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I wonder if reversing with silver
is contributing to the hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_00]: traits my quick answer with positive
Confidence is nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the plants which you are
choosing that are contributing to your
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite traits It says um I am
starting with solid genetics that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been grown to harvest with no
hermaphrodite traits in sight Tested some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seeds that were made and have a
very high Rate of herms is there something
[SPEAKER_00]: other than silver I can use to reverse Not
what those two plants know whichever two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you were using one of them
Definitely is carrying the intersex gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the dominant trait in that
plant, but it is in there actually We've
[SPEAKER_00]: never bred with these before it could be a
dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen it express itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hidden in there You unlocked it by
breeding to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these two plants has that
intersex trait in it I'm not sure which
[SPEAKER_00]: two plants you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which two plants Which of the
two you reversed but it is definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: the silver that is causing the intersex
trait It is the plants the plants are what
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing it If the silver what is what was
causing this all of my projects all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your projects everybody's projects
involving silver would have intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits the common Common denominator here
is your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the thing that is showing the
intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know Which plant did you reverse
and then I also want to know how Many
[SPEAKER_00]: plants did you pollinate and then did you
pollinate one or did you pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple plants of that pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those seeds have you grown was
was it a self-project or was it an
[SPEAKER_00]: outcross where there were multiple do the
s ones do they show fan or hermaphroditism
[SPEAKER_00]: or do all of the population show
hermaphroditism that would really help us
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow down where the herm trait is coming
from But I am super sure that the herm
[SPEAKER_00]: trait did not come from the silver You
said that you've grown these plants To
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest before but have you stress tested
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you taken these plants in a room and
fucked with a timer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you messed with their light cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you messed with their feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you messed with drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you messed with flood?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all conditions that I would
definitely experiment with before breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: to that plant push them to their limit
Find out when they snap see what it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: to really piss these plants off before you
breed to them I'm gonna go over this and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I'm covering everything here
because I've been going really quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: with this episode It feels like this may
be a short but powerful Episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh hermaphrodites coming from silver
solid traits grown to harvest no
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite traits in sight in sight See
that's um, it was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in one of these plants So what I
would recommend I wouldn't breed I may
[SPEAKER_00]: pick totally different plants But if you
insist on using these plants again,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a way to find out which one is the
intersex plant whichever one you chose as
[SPEAKER_00]: your pollen donor do the same thing again
and then pollinate whichever plant you
[SPEAKER_00]: chose last time again, but then pollinate
other plants as well if the other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: all show intersex traits from the progeny
It's your pollen donor if only some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them show the intersex It could be the
plant that is receiving the pollen and not
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen donor But we've got to start
doing a process of elimination here Then
[SPEAKER_00]: my next run I would do a different pollen
donor and hit all of those feet I moved
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that was a pollen donor before
move it right into the line and are the
[SPEAKER_00]: men make it a pollen receiver this time
with a different donor and that's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: way you're going to find out where That
intersex trait lies where it's hidden But
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you that the intersex didn't
come out of any of the the silver the
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex Guaranteed came out of the plants
that you started with so sometimes that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the magic of breeding Sometimes you put
plant a plant B together those chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: mix the X's and Y's they all jingle up
together They land how they come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you create the hottest new fire
Sometimes you make a big old bag of herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what might be happening
That's why you just got to grow them and
[SPEAKER_00]: test them out and this is one of the Big
reasons why I recommend pollinating
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple female plants with the same
pollen donor because like I keep saying
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if it's your and maybe
I don't know how many plants you pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: it I don't know if you made s ones I don't
know if you made a bunch of our ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if it's just the we're just gonna say
What's your name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your name is skunky Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just gonna say we took skunky Steve
s1 or skunky Steve We're just gonna call a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant skunky Steve and you took two cuts
and tried to make s ones if those are
[SPEAKER_00]: herms There's only one Plant in there
contributing to that intersex mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've read it out to other things Then
we could see where that intersex lies But
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's just an s1 then skunky Steve is a
herm if you pollinated skunky other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with skunky Steve If half of those are
herms, I would say it came from skunky
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve if none of them are herms I would
say that that's how we would figure it out
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking in circles now trying to
figure out that process of elimination,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is definitely in those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in The it's not in the silver,
but that's why I would pollinate multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: females That's what I was saying pollinate
multiple females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can see what is actually happening
Is that the pollen donor or is it the
[SPEAKER_00]: females where the problem lies process of
elimination more data?
