[SPEAKER_00]: know, I like to start this podcast off by
talking about what I'm smoking today I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been taking dabs of garlic Grove live
batter from green dot labs This is a blend
[SPEAKER_00]: of GMO cookies and LOA F2 on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as general sows
garlic and orange soda I think I really
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with that flavor description There
is not a potency label on the back of this
[SPEAKER_00]: package for some reason that sticker did
not get put on here It does not need that
[SPEAKER_00]: sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it should have is a fist There should
just be a logo with a fist right there
[SPEAKER_00]: because this was the most pleasant punch
to the face I have had in a long time when
[SPEAKER_00]: I dab this I was immediately punched With
this orange flavor this orange zestiness
[SPEAKER_00]: hit my face overwhelmed my mouth Then as I
exhale that is when the garlic really
[SPEAKER_00]: kicks in it's garlic and orange That's why
I get why they're calling why they're
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it general sows It is really
garlic and orangey on the exhale then that
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic and a little bit of funk Just hangs
out on your tongue on my tongue at least
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of minutes and I really enjoy
it I'm obviously super heavily medicated
[SPEAKER_00]: from the garlic Grove to be quite honest
with you This is not the first take that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have tried to do This intro to be quite
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up all my recording gear had my
headphones on I took a dab I thought I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna record and I found myself on the
couch scrolling through social media
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get my shit together So this is
a quality concentrate a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends at green dot labs for the
garlic Grove live batter All right.

also there is a link for seeds here now in
[SPEAKER_00]: the video description i do my best to make
things easy for you thank you guys for
[SPEAKER_00]: your support all right now i think it is
time to move into the question and email
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the show the first question
i've got lined up for today's episode
[SPEAKER_00]: actually came from youtube i'm looking for
the screenshot on my phone i generally do
[SPEAKER_00]: not take questions from youtube i prefer
to get the questions off of patreon or
[SPEAKER_00]: email of course patreon is the first
option that's where i go for questions if
[SPEAKER_00]: i get all those questions caught up then i
go to the email but sometimes i find good
[SPEAKER_00]: questions on the youtube i'm not
necessarily looking for them but i found a
[SPEAKER_00]: good comment there and this one has been
coming up on social media quite a bit so i
[SPEAKER_00]: thought i would address this one it says
rasta jeff can you tell from looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and see if it is male or female i
know that people are passing around a
[SPEAKER_00]: chart on social media it shows that if
there is a volcano shape at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the seed or if there's a dimple or
a nipple shape or a bottle nose dolphin
[SPEAKER_00]: shape on part of the seed that it's a
female if it's got another shape it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: male that is total bullshit if that was
accurate seed breeders would be fishing
[SPEAKER_00]: through every seed with a magnifying glass
and we would pull out all of the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that we wanted and give you all the seeds
we didn't want i wouldn't do that but that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a thing that happened nobody can
tell a seed's sex by looking at the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going by that chart that you see
on social media you're going to be poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly sorely disappointed don't do that i
do not believe in that chart i don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: any other breeders or growers that believe
in that that rely on that so no i do not
[SPEAKER_00]: believe you can tell a sex of a seed just
by looking at the seed uh thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great youtube comment uh thank you for
following me on youtube big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend lance hope you're doing well bro
looks like you got a kitty in your picture
[SPEAKER_00]: i think that's a cat or is it a dog i
don't know bro but i like a person with
[SPEAKER_00]: pets in their picture so big shout out
thank you for the great comment i hope i
[SPEAKER_00]: answered your question uh next time send
me an email grow from your heart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com or even better support us on
patreon patreon.com forward slash grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart all right let's keep
moving the next message came on the email
[SPEAKER_00]: this one came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an update and or a correction
actually btk which killed caterpillar type
[SPEAKER_00]: critters then it goes on to say for fungus
gnats i think your listener should try
[SPEAKER_00]: using bti so i've been educated today that
there are different strains of bacillus
[SPEAKER_00]: thuringensis is how i think it's said
bacteria there's a btk and a bti um i can
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounce the btk it is uh the k stands
for uh krstaki and the i is israel and sis
[SPEAKER_00]: it's close enough you guys we're learning
in public today um just all about sounding
[SPEAKER_00]: it out but there are two different
bacillus bt bacterias and i did not
[SPEAKER_00]: realize this so uh one is better for
caterpillar type critters and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one is better for fungus gnats so that'll
make it easier to shop for a more uh pest
[SPEAKER_00]: specific product if we are applying the
right pesticide we will have more uh
[SPEAKER_00]: success getting rid of the pest and we
will do less damage to the plant because
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the pesticides and soaks and
sprays they do cause slight problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: irritations to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: so i just wanted to ask you to make sure
you're doing something with it oh that's
[SPEAKER_00]: scary so uh thank you for educating me and
then it wraps up with stay iry brother
[SPEAKER_00]: then they signed it with baked baker on
cannabis so if you're not already on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis join up on cannabis if you're
already there go ahead and give my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: baked baker a follow on cannabis and of
course please give me a follow too i'm iry
[SPEAKER_00]: underscore genetics on cannabis hey baked
baker thank you for the great message uh i
[SPEAKER_00]: called this one an update and a correction
you guys there are more than one strain of
[SPEAKER_00]: bt beneficial bacteria there's the btk
which is better for caterpillars and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the bti which is better for fungus
gnats so we all learned something today
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out big thank you all right i
want to keep it moving because i do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of more emails and i don't want to
run out of time i don't want my throat to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn out too quickly you guys know that if
i talk too long i will run out of my voice
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's keep going this one says hey
rasta jeff thank you for answering my
[SPEAKER_00]: question on the podcast regarding carbon
filters so i'm sure you guys remember a
[SPEAKER_00]: few episodes back i spoke about carbon
filters it says that was cool for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason i heard that in a beavis and
butthead voice that was cool then it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: real quick one of my m dog plants has
sprouted a pollen sack and germinated i
[SPEAKER_00]: think you say you mean pollinated some
buds on the lower branch near the stem so
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got an m dog plant it sprouted a
pollen sack so i think it has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite on you it's shown uh some
intersex traits and it is spread pollen so
[SPEAKER_00]: it has pollinated some buds on the lower
branch near the stem the top buds seem
[SPEAKER_00]: fine i have run this girl many times with
no herm issues um my first question is why
[SPEAKER_00]: did it herm this time then uh do you know
why it hermed on you this time did it have
[SPEAKER_00]: a light leak did you overfeed it did you
stress it did it get too hot what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue that caused it to herm that's the
first thing i want to know uh then it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: on to say question is should i top it in
case another one sprouts a pollen sack so
[SPEAKER_00]: should you talk should you chop this plant
down in case it sprouts another pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: sack you're worried um that's a good
question or do you think i could let her
[SPEAKER_00]: finish with no problems it's kind of late
for that you've already got problems um
[SPEAKER_00]: how do i feel about that it depends on how
big the plant is do you need it do you
[SPEAKER_00]: need that that finished product that
seeded finished product or can you live
[SPEAKER_00]: without it is it going to hurt your budget
is it going to hurt your medicine supply
[SPEAKER_00]: is it going to hurt your stash it's a
risky plant it's a problematic plant but
[SPEAKER_00]: is it worth the reward that's when you've
got a way the risk reward the problem to
[SPEAKER_00]: the payoff is it worth the reward that
you've got that's when you've got a way
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk reward that you've got is if you
have too many weeds that means there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of seeds you do not see as a breeder i
know that the outside seeds are just the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip of the iceberg so to speak and once
you break open those buds there's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in there so you may have a lot more
seeds than what you're thinking you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to know if you should chop it in
case it gets more pollen sacks Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may make, it may do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could make more pollen, but is it too
late to pollinate the rest of the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants that are in the room
already past their pollination point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the, the, uh, the pistols,
have they curled up or the hairs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they brown and nasty looking at that
point, their past peak pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how far into flower you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, we can find out because it says I
have about 10 more days to hit eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you're seven more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, you're in week the end of week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're at a really critical part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're going to have a lot of seeds
and the seeds that you made are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to also, and they could possibly be
hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have some gems in there,
but that's not what you're worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're wondering if you should cut it
down here at week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I read this, um, you've
probably gotten close to the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest right now, but I would almost just
cut that fucker down cause it's stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure it doesn't cause me more
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also keep in mind, there are probably
a lot of seeds happening in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says I'd be happy with one more
week, or do you think it's a gamble and
[SPEAKER_00]: just chop her now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you have a perpetual grow going?
[SPEAKER_00]: If all of your plants are at the same
cycle, the ones right around this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to have some pollen or some
seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the rest of them aren't too
seeded, but if you've got more plants at a
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier stage and you've got more plants
that are coming in and staggering,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have the opportunity to keep
pollinating your future crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got more shit going on,
I would get rid of it because you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to continue the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that are in there have probably
already been pollinated or are past their
[SPEAKER_00]: peak pollination point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're past ovulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably can't take pollen any
further at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you're at like week six,
week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they can receive pollen right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would cut this plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think about what caused it to
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did it flip on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What it's probably something you caused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to point a finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to blame you, but you say it
ran fine a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's herming on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a light leak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there an issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, did you overfeed it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to figure out what caused the
herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need to think about, do you want
to risk this same problem in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this plant is problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this dog bites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to keep putting it on a
fucking leash and taking it to the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: park and having to pull it off other dogs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would fucking get rid of it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just chop it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very different approach to
gardening than a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have access to a lot of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cut this one down, I get to grow
something else in its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is not a hermaphrodite,
something that does not give me problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: something I don't want to kick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this plant accidentally pollinated my
crop, I want to kick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mad at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would already be in a fucking trash can
if this were me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on how much you love this
plant, how much you need the medicine off
[SPEAKER_00]: of this plant and how much you want to
give yourself a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I decided halfway through reading
this that cut that fucking thing down,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of it, stop fighting yourself and
set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the answer that I would go with,
but I don't know how bad you need the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine or the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that is my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut it down, cut your losses, quit fucking
up the rest of the grow with the
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic plant and replace it with
something that is not problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see if you put your name in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not say your name, so you know who
you are, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, let me know how this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a follow-up and I will read it on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you chose to do and
how the outcome came and, uh, how many
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds did you get and what are you going
to do with the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't share these seeds until
you've grown them yourself until you know
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're problematic or if they're
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't share crappy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since they came from a crappy plant,
I'm not calling your plant crappy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it hermed on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, since they came from a questionable
crappy plant, they're questionable crappy
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered all the notes I wrote on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did it herm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a light leak, probably overfeed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're probably more seeds than you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may keep making pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could pop up more pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it could be too late to pollinate
the rest of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a perpetual cycle going on,
the rest of it's going to just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: getting pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would call that fucker and get rid
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward to another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one starts off with good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, good evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely not morning time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're smoking a fat bull,
whatever time it is, wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came down to write you an email and
noticed the new podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that when people go to write me a
message or send me a tweet or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a brand new episode for them
to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always puts a smile on people's face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I just so happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You answered my last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went to write me a message and as you
were writing it, I answered your last
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love stuff like that synchronicities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there is no, uh, that that
stuff's supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I had a small chuckle
at the way things work sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will clarify about the last
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was talking about RO and calcium
buildup, I meant RO water in humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know if you put tap water in
them, they will start to build white
[SPEAKER_00]: powder on the walls from the calcium in
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or so that is what I had read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not only will it start to build white
powder on the walls, it will build up
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium on the walls possibly,
but you will ruin the filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the filters will get clogged up with
the calcium quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on to say, where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cutting out of the root ball and
living soil was bore along the lines of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was looking into and actually found
a way with these rapid stack pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently there was another part of
the question about living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here is the part that we need to
address on today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says anyway, here is my problem venting
from my ceiling into my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the excess heat has caused
my house to heat up too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those grow lights will heat up
the house quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have attempted to move it around
within the same circuit and use my dryer
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust, but then it started to blow
breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that puts off so many things I want to
talk about in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're flipping breakers,
you were definitely putting your house in
[SPEAKER_00]: danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting everybody in risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't have to preach too much about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is the breaker is heating
up so much that it goes, huh, I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: quit running because I'm pulling way too
much electricity and this could cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breaker flips, but every time that
happens, the wires are heating up hot
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to flip that breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually the coating on the outside of
the wires, the polyurethane stuff will
[SPEAKER_00]: melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two wires will touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that'll take a while, but eventually
that she will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how old your house is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of wiring you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got old wiring in a really old
house, you've got a much more potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for starting a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a new house, still run a
risk, but it's not as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful if you're flipping breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that comes to mind is you
said you tried to run it through the dryer
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust, which makes me think you were
tying in your grow exhaust into the dryer
[SPEAKER_00]: vent exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a good idea either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like a big deal,
but never really modify the exhaust system
[SPEAKER_00]: in a home, whether it comes to the dryer
exhaust or the HVAC system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those systems were designed, uh,
very specifically for the flow of the
[SPEAKER_00]: house and the heating and cooling
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go tying in another duct that was
not planned for, you're going to create
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for backflow air that
shouldn't go a certain way should have
[SPEAKER_00]: never gone a certain way will now go a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll disrupt the airflow of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've either got the opportunity of
blowing the warm air from your grove into
[SPEAKER_00]: cool spaces or blowing the cool air into
warm spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go the wrong way because
it's not how it was meant to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you'll end up with dryer lint in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that shit goes wrong, nobody wants a
dryer lint in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be picking that shit out
of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that'll really happen,
but don't tie those in and don't fuck up
[SPEAKER_00]: the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be safer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also now can use my, I also now cannot
use my dehumidifier as that pumped out too
[SPEAKER_00]: much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you're cranking up a lot of heat
in a little space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so now my room is running at 28
degrees Celsius and 45 percent relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity daytime and nighttime is about 23
or 24 degrees Celsius with about 52
[SPEAKER_00]: percent relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not dropping too much for your
night temperature, but you're getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more humidity and they're not
extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're going to have to remove the
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to duct it a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would duct it outside or at an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either going to have to move that
duct that you tried to tie into the dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to run it outside
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know what your opportunity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a fireplace?
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it into the fireplace and it'll go up
the fireplace and out the chimney,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, or use a window, seal up the window,
put a hole in a board or a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: insulation or however you can seal the
window, then make a six or an eight inch
[SPEAKER_00]: hole, run a blower out through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to use a carbon filter,
but you're going to have to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat or add an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just going to be able to blow
heat around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're just going to heat up the whole
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how big your house is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that it's going to come up and
tell me how big the grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says I've done a bit of grading on
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know with extra CO2, they can handle
higher heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe this is the route I'm going
to have to take before I read too much
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that this is probably
not the best solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more like a bandaid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really fixing the heat problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just kind of covering it up with
something else that costs more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an experiment, you don't want to,
uh, rely on CO2 bags, those little make
[SPEAKER_00]: your own CO2 mushroom bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shit, those aren't going to provide
enough CO2 to, uh, supplement the,
[SPEAKER_00]: to fix the heat problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to bandaid that shit
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get the CO2
bottles and a system and turn it up a real
[SPEAKER_00]: high to get enough CO2 in there to
mitigate that heat issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue, the solution is to correct the
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't create more problems and
spend more money on the wrong shit by just
[SPEAKER_00]: buying a mask and a bandaid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to actually solve the problem or
at least that's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want, but I
wouldn't, I wouldn't go that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then it says, how much would I need
for a four by four and a two by four tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of set off some weird bells in
my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much light are you running in a four
by four and a two by four that is heating
[SPEAKER_00]: up your entire house?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see your setup a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see how you've got the
tent set up, how you're running the
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting, where you're running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you a lot of guidance and
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really small area of grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you shouldn't have an extreme amount
of light in there at the biggest in that
[SPEAKER_00]: four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a thousand, which is
pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that two by four, what do you got
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a 400, maybe a six.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of light for that little bit
of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have a whole lot of bang and
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shouldn't be too hard to cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure with a little bit of,
uh, uh, knowledge from an experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, someone who has set up a lot of
rooms, I'm sure we could cool this down
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit without doing the CO2 idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, would it be better to
exhaust my flower tent into the long room
[SPEAKER_00]: or keep the whole thing and closed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think that the CO2 is the way
to go, but if you're going to do CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, put the two tents in one room and fill
that whole room with CO2 and just keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 moving or put the CO2 straight in the
tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it's going to ducked out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the tent in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just do the whole, you're going to have
to augment the entire room is what you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, you're going to have to,
I would reduce the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 reduce the heat work on removing
the heat or adding an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2, in my opinion is a bandaid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets a little bit hotter,
how many more band-aids are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: put on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just keep adding CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correct thing to do is to fix the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, you can keep trying to
battle the heat or you can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate equipment to correct the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says, uh, that you're flipping
breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much lighter you run it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really confused and I'm not trying to
disrespect your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a two by four, you can't have too many
Watts going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what's going on in this girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can give you more guidance,
more advice, get you a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in, cool down your room a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe we can figure out how to run
your equipment more efficiently off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm pretty sure most people can't
augment the electricity in their house,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I look forward to, Oh, this one's from
Tonto also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I look forward to a follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also says PS, if any of this is
unclear, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will clarify, dude, I want pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can send me a video, just walk
through and be like, this is what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would really help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help us both out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will follow up with some updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big shout out to my buddy Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you've got an email question,
a cannabis culture, a cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: question, my email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having fun on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from, uh, this one came from
the grow from your heart email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Jeff, I'm the French dude
that you answered the question about the
[SPEAKER_00]: light leaks on your show a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it was October.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I remember answering a lot of
questions about light leaks, but it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: on to say, here I am again, still
listening to your awesome show almost
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says lately because of this COVID
lockdown shit, I was happier than ever to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to your show because it is good to
have your positivity and enthusiasm in
[SPEAKER_00]: this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know as a content provider that people
kind of turn to us for, uh, just an
[SPEAKER_00]: escape, a getaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you getting some sort of
knowledge, but you're just escaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not thinking about all the COVID
shit or the dumb shit that's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bring any of it up so you don't
think about it right now, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, thank you for noticing and thank you
for the, uh, for mentioning that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, but I was dealing with COVID and
quarantine and all that shit as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was using podcasting as an outlet to
communicate with people and keep myself
[SPEAKER_00]: occupied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you guys were, uh,
using my work as something to entertain
[SPEAKER_00]: yourselves that worked out very well for
both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it goes on to say my question today is
about lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lighting expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, lighting is where I am the most
uneducated when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a lighting expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot for me to learn when it
comes to lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Keith has taught me a little bit about
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of other people have tried to
teach me a lot about lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain doesn't absorb that stuff the way
that it absorbs the plant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully I can answer your lighting
question, but I just wanted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: completely honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I grow in a two by two
foot tent with 120 watt LED and it says
[SPEAKER_00]: actual power, 120 Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am pretty satisfied with it,
uh, for both flowering and the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, but I'd like to add a little boost
because sometimes you just want a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more light, more growth and more bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we all want more growth and more bud
and a good way to get that is more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm aiming for something like a
200 watt for the whole tent, even though I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that talking in Watts is not really
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are many ways to measure lights
and I don't think that Watts are the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to measure them accurately for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't think plants know what Watts
even are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want the right spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you most per Joule is the proper
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me quit talking out of my
ass and we'll get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you have any advice on
supplemental lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about adding some LED bars,
something like one bar for grow and one
[SPEAKER_00]: bar for flowering, or maybe a CFL full
spectrum bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do the CFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer the LEDs, but it is pretty
difficult to know which direction to go
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays with all of the information on
the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried the forums, but I remembered what
you said about grow advice on the forums
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of bullshit on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that own light companies go and
they comment like they're just users and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people that don't know anything
about growing, they say that they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or great success with the certain light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a fluke because something
else in there grow was what was magical or
[SPEAKER_00]: what was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be really good at fishing
through bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you were getting advice on
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says, I figured why not simply ask
my buddy from overseas, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so if by any chance you read this
email, I'd be really glad to get some help
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your buddy, Rick from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Rick from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's great to know that I've got
people over in France listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about some grow
light advice for my friend Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you are close to having
enough light in that two by two tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you want to almost double
up the amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, if you're going to do it,
I would double up during veg and flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to have certain amount
of light at one point and then not have
[SPEAKER_00]: full power for the whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go full power the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you're going to buy,
make sure you've got the electricity to
[SPEAKER_00]: run that light, both lights, all of the
lights, make sure you've got enough power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our listener before they're flipping
breakers in their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they try to run all their gear,
make sure you've got the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing, make sure you're able to
cool it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our listener before it's too hot in
their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't cool it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're able to cool it with
those two things being thought about and
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a couple of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a two by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put one Canon led from black sale
market in that two by two and it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be more light than you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 325 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would light up your two by
two beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a Canon is perfect for a three by
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to light up your two by two
and your plants are going to go kaboom,
[SPEAKER_00]: kapow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would try, I would recommend about
300 Watts in that two by two, maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 200 Watts total will be right
about where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannons, you can dial them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a little knob, a it's hidden,
but it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith will show you where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be in the instruction book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't read the instruction book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I admit it, but there's a little knob.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a screwdriver and you can turn
down the wattage so you can get it down to
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it goes that low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can play with the wattage and you can
get it dialed in for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing to consider is ceiling
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you've got enough height,
I think a Canon would be wonderful for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I would find something with a good
reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do a lot of research and I would
find something around 200 Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like 200 Watts would be just
about perfect for your square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly do not know enough about LED
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody pays me to recommend lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody pays me to talk about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsored by an LED company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow with them and they work
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are fucking happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have flowered earlier because
they took off in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got kind of tall in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made the plants grow super, super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend the Canon LED from Black Sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said friend from overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are available in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith, if I am wrong, please send me an
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to give accurate information
about your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you check out Black Sale
Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Google Black Sale Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Sale LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith is a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work with companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of vendors, a lot of
brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your product has to be fucking top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your product is top notch and
you're a dick, I still may not use your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your product is top notch and you're
cool as shit, I'm buying your shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about you on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith, big fist bump, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Black Sale Market, Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to my buddy, Rick from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate knowing that I've got friends
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate knowing that I'm helping
you out in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to hearing from you
again in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has any cannabis
culture or cannabis cultivation questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I would love to hear from you.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've got one more thing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to find it here in the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my version of being organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and I got more than one message
like this, or I would have ignored it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it is time to address this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, man, I'd like to see your dread
sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's a pain to get long dreads
in the camera, but maybe just for a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of an episode, I would just
like to see the texture, size and shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a weird odd request,
but it's been asked so many times that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it is time to bust out the
dreadlocks for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels a little bit weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a grow show, but so I've got them
tied in a knot, tie it, untie that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got a hair tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a fucking headband that
works as a hair tie, but I've got that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're tied up in here to pull out the
hair tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this hat is too big,
but it's comfortable as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing you the dreads of trying to
get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that are only listening on audio,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to watch the YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to YouTube, search for the grow from
your heart podcast and check out this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode and see the dreadlocks if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got them all, they're down,
they're hanging down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you the, what did you
want to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: The texture, size and shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a couple, I'm going to say
there's a couple of different textures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are more uniform, the smaller ones,
that's the texture and size and shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like my common size ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got a couple, this one that
comes from, let me get natural direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this may get edited more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just leave all this in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting real comfortable with the
video show you guys, if you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a couple of thick ones like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get this going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's real thick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is almost the diameter of a can
of butane, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thinner, but I mean, you know,
it's comparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I measured as a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm supposed to say this
because a friend is doing a giveaway based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the length of my dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I hope your giveaway is done before
this podcast comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My longest dread was 49 inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured with the tape measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: 49 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll stand up and show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also try to get somebody to snap a
photo for me so that I've got a good stand
[SPEAKER_00]: up from the back kind of a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do it right here with this
camera just on the Mac book, but I'm stand
[SPEAKER_00]: up, show you the dreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be able to hear me for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're listening on iTunes or Apple
podcasts or Stitcher, I invite you to come
[SPEAKER_00]: check us out on the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, show the dreads real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm 6'5 and they go to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of stuff to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see them tied up almost all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them down at concerts and when I'm
not doing stuff, you know, but it's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to have all this hanging from your head
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to work in a garden or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're mostly tied up, but I
appreciate the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was time to address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little bit awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felt a little bit weird as I was swinging
them around there, but a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: asked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it was time to show off the
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the length, the texture,
the color, the size, the shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the shit that you wanted to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not shy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't be shy having dreadlocks for this
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all the questions eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that wraps that up for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has any,
I guess, dreadlock questions as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free, ask away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, while I'm thinking about it,
please check out my friends at Operation
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm part of a thing called Operation Grow,
sponsored by PL Grow Systems, is also
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored by New Millennium Nutrients and
Auto Pot Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it is sponsored by
iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you briefly about what Operation
Grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Operation Grow, I was I gave,
let me correct myself and catch up with my
[SPEAKER_00]: own thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to read my notes and my notes
threw me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Operation Grow is, I donated packs of
seeds to six growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think six growers got the same pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got orange-gasm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all given an auto pot system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all given New Millennium
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all growing on the same schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all talking about our progress and
documenting our grow on Operation Grow on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can find it under Operation
Grow 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of course it started in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's 2020 now, but it started back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing here is I am inviting
you to check out the show Operation Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Saturday, Mountain Time at 2 p.m.,
we go live on YouTube and we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that is involved in Operation
Grow shows their progress with the
[SPEAKER_00]: orange-gasm plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all germinated at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all using the auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all using New Millennium
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only differences are the lighting and
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people got samples of cocoa as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think everybody's using cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few variables in this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody also has a PL Grow minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to see the temperature,
the humidity, the fluctuations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the VPD in these rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting a lot of documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really fun experiment project
series that is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you every Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your iPhone to let you know what time
you need to tune in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you missed the live show,
it is YouTube and they are magically left
[SPEAKER_00]: up there forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go watch them on Operation Grow
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I caught that note before I
wrapped up the show because I got to give
[SPEAKER_00]: a shout out to my buddy Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pete, thank you for letting me be the
breeder to donate the seeds for the
[SPEAKER_00]: operation and just for being involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning about my own genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting data that I never would have
had access to before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in today's modern world, data is
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got to figure out what the fuck
to do with the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
