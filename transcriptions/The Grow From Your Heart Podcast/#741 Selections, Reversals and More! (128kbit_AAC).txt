[SPEAKER_00]: podcast comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Patreon episode will be loaded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a Patreon only, a Patreon
exclusive episode that will be posted for
[SPEAKER_00]: the month of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode does include myself and White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we each ate a hundred milligrams of
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rambled on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is two hours long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not any Grow information in that
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be completely open and honest,
I did not put Grow information on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon show because I want to give you
guys all of the Grow information,
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that to be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to be able to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Patreon episode is honestly just a
hangout with Mike and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, if you're on the Patreon,
look for that video with White Mike and
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
that video should have loaded by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two hour video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 4K.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has taken all day to load.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for that episode on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big thanks to the Irish Army
for supporting the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big thanks for all of the shout outs
and support and positivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody out there had a great
Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you spent some time with your mom,
your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your mom's not with us anymore,
big hug to mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big love to all the moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the moms, none of us would be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I do have some topics to talk
about, not just a bunch of rambles on
[SPEAKER_00]: today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few great emails here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, we're going to jump right into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I titled The Selection Question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend that calls
themselves J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, in every 10 to 20 seeds,
there is one plant that just looks happy
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed sometimes that when you run a
pack of seeds, you'll run 10 or 20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always going to be one that
just shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the dating pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I describe dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I describe finding the
phenotype that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is going to shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, in your opinion, how important is
that plant in the selection process?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it just shines says a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it shining because... Now, there are a
couple of things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it shining because it's the only one
getting the right shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it shining because it is thriving?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we run plants for the first time,
we don't know what they expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just give them... In most cases,
we give them the general 84, 80-ish
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give them all the basics and we run
them the first time and see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are going to be happy in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are not going to be happy in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you're always finding... And
that's a good... The odds of that one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant shining are always really good
because we've designed... We've bred these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to work in the grow rooms which
we've designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have been bred to work in the
rooms and the rooms have been designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with the plants the way that we bred
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a 10-pack or a 20-pack in
a decent grow room, you're always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find at least one that super shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that one shining because the other
nine are not happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the 19 are not happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that one shining because it is super
happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, also, is it shining because that's
the one that isn't real picky,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't require a lot of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're running into is just
phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is happier than the others and
it is shining.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is that in the selection
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is half of what we're... That's a
small portion of what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than half of what we're looking for
is the performance of the plants in that
[SPEAKER_00]: one condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It performed well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good indication that it works
well in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how does it smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it give you a good harvest weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it give you good potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the smoke give you a desirable
effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the flavor there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because flavor matters a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it give you the weight that you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are also very important factors to
think about during a selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing it is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it grows well, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you cut it down, the consumer has
no idea how it grew and they don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, the best plants to smoke
are the plants that grew like shit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that the grower had to struggle
with is the one that the smokers really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, only part of the... It's like a
chessboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it memetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 64 squares on a chessboard,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one looking good in the grow room
during the grow is one square of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chessboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need bug resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all kinds of other things to make
this a winner, not just one square on the
[SPEAKER_00]: chessboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to cover the whole board if you
want to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm bad at describing things,
but I'm sure you know this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always has the perfect leaf angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect color.
[SPEAKER_00]: No visible signs of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like she just wants to give
you a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do know that plant very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you grow a lot more and you get more
experienced, you'll be able to get every
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the room to look that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know that this one, I need to move
it away from the light because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: like the extra heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I put it in the corner,
it kind of enjoys that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one, it needs to go right
under the light because it wants all the
[SPEAKER_00]: extra light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I shouldn't water it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I can practically overwater it
and it loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll start learning those things
about those individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in selection, something I say a lot of
times is don't select the plant for the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not selecting for internet purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are selecting for potency, vigor,
resistance to bugs, terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of other things that we're
selecting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're selecting for Instagram,
for photos, that is the great phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to grow it all the way out,
dry it, cure it, finish it, and then see
[SPEAKER_00]: if it is desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the only way to tell is to
dry it, cure it, smoke it, and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, that being said, I haven't had
the happiest plant and the best smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: plant line up ever in 18 years of
sprouting 10 seeds at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just bad luck or am I doing
something wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is the way that the weed gods
like to mess with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been growing, it says, 18 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been growing cannabis, producing
cannabis for 18 years, which means you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good at it by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're pretty good at it by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the world goes, oh, you've got some
skills, you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about instead of giving you this
perfect plant, we're going to give you two
[SPEAKER_00]: to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often make the joke that when you run a
10 pack, one is going to be best for the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer and one is going to be best for
the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of what you're saying here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The happiest plant and best smelling plant
don't seem to line up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that the consumers want,
they never saw how much of a pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ass that plant was to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, I want an ounce of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that one that grew super simply
for you and put out all the weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't the desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never the desirable one for the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a joke that I say the weed
gods play on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just how phenotypes work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always find at least one keeper in a 10
pack of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hard part is deciding which of the
three I usually want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that usually tastes real good,
one that's usually super potent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that one that just super fucking
performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal there is to breed that line
further and get the things that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, you're not doing anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are doing it just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that is just a funny joke
that the cannabis gods, the ganja gods,
[SPEAKER_00]: play on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best smelling one and the best
performing plant are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer and the grower are always
going to have different opinions in that
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend J.H., I feel like I
rambled on quite a bit about that
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any follow ups, I would love
to hear your follow up question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has any
questions, corrections, comments or
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns on this question, my email
address, of course, is growfrom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reach on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another message right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all the Patreon
supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Guido's Grow Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Guido at Guido's
Grow Room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that three times fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time was hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and it says, Hey, Mr. RJ,
got a quick question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting ready to flip some plants via
STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to reverse some plants using
a silver thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked a lot about that on other
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn a lot more about
reversing plants with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full podcast, simply Google
grow from your heart podcast, STS mix or
[SPEAKER_00]: my STS, it will come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so he said, I'm getting ready to
reverse some plants via silver
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am wondering if you have ever done
it under an 1113 DJ short style light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we put our plants on 12
hours on and 12 hours off to trigger the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend DJ short a long time ago taught
us that 11 hours on and 13 hours off will
[SPEAKER_00]: give us different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, they are improved results.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, they are diminished
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the extended dark period
gives the plants an opportunity to show
[SPEAKER_00]: their expression a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see more phenotypical variation,
more phenotypical expression is what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that I believe I'm seeing with this
extended dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not common practice for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've stopped doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do something way different, which I've
talked about in other episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but DJ short has been doing the 1113 for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, if you're flowering
for 63 days, that is 63 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity that you don't have to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 63 hours of power that didn't go
through your light bulb, your air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner, your blower, all your fans,
everything got to chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cool down for 63 extra hours,
which economically that is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, photons are the number
one source of energy for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give them all the light that
they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother debate, a whole
nother conversation right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about putting these plants
under 1113 after they have been treated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the silver thiosulfate solution in an
attempt to make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've got four ladies in the room
flowering now, and we'll be adding the two
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal candidates into the spot
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't be any issues, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see an issue, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the four ladies are in the flowering
room now and you're just adding the two
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal candidates, you may have mistimed
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My general practice, my standard operating
procedure is to begin the reversal,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the plants being sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray them seven to 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first plant to get reversed,
get sprayed 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it goes into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that one will get sprayed again on
day one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then day three, six, nine, 12,
15, 18, 21, and possibly day 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not put the pollen receiving plants
into that room until I see those reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: plants begin to show me definite signs of
male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I start seeing those pollen sacks pop
up, that is when I move the female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I time it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that timing works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a few days now,
several days, 26 to 32 days before that
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant starts producing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your girls are already in there,
how long have they been in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering now, I'll be adding two
reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't say how long they've been in
there, but they're ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're too far ahead of the male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be past their peak
ovulation point of receiving pollen to
[SPEAKER_00]: create seeds if you don't get those males
dumping pollen a little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had timed it a little bit
differently, you would make a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, probably double the amount of seeds,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those plants, the female plants,
the pollen receivers, to have the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People understand what I mean when I say
the dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it starts making, you guys call it
hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it starts making, all the hairs start
popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those hairs are what are going to catch
the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what catches the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It draws the pollen down that into the
ovule, into the bract, into the calyx,
[SPEAKER_00]: starts forming a seed within that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all those hairs are what are going to
make the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those hairs have to be at the prime peak
point for pollination to get the most
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're real thick and real strong
looking, right after that is when they
[SPEAKER_00]: want the most pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they start fading.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start wrinkling, start crinkling up,
start getting brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get withered up and small,
they can no longer receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've passed their peak point of
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they've gone into menopause if you
want to compare them to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you are doing okay,
but the timing could have been better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tear it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get seeds out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't be any issues, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the 11-13 cycle should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I have not done that,
so I don't have a testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the info I've got, the knowledge,
experience, I think it will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will do what needs done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may help you out because your mail,
your reversal plants may actually flip
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly because they're sleeping
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how that will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be beneficial to correct your
timing issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and of course, once they start to
show boy parts, they'll go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just need a week to finish trim jail as I
dry in the other tent, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have an awesome day,
my man, and thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Guido, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got the right idea,
but I think the timing may have been off
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're limited on space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're stuck in trim jail, which should I
ramble on that or should I just let it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim jail is a weird thing to me because I
actually have friends in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I said trim jail to them,
they'd be like, motherfucker, do you see
[SPEAKER_00]: where I am?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd find it really disrespectful
for me to say that sitting here,
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting at the table, listening to
sublime, eating Doritos, talking to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and cutting up weed under the air
conditioner to put the word jail in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends in real jail would be fucking
offended.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd find it disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my quick rant on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like trim jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a silly fucking word.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's real people in a real jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get what you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to time it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to work, and I think
your light cycle will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything will turn out just the
way that you want it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: My request is send me an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me details.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many seeds do you pull from the plants
that you put in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you satisfied with the outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you get pollen on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be my main question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Guido, send me a follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some info, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the follow up, this came on May 9th,
so it should be a couple of weeks here
[SPEAKER_00]: before I get more info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you until about June 1st,
and I'll expect an update from you,
[SPEAKER_00]: my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Guido, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how long we've been rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of time for one more
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a great question here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came on the
growfromyourheartathotmail.com email
[SPEAKER_00]: address, and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Ross DeJeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: My actual name is Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Jack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, when you used 1,000 watt HPS,
which is a high pressure sodium lamp,
[SPEAKER_00]: what reflector type and what distance to
the canopy do you find to be optimal?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was running 1,000 watt high
pressure sodium light, let's talk about my
[SPEAKER_00]: personal small home grow, because I'm
pretty sure this person isn't running a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow with Gavitas, which is
what I do in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a small home grow or a
small personal private setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had 1,000 watt HPS, what reflector
type and what distance do I find to be
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the vented and ducted hoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds weird to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to explain what I'm talking
about, because some people may not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all lights, not all, but the basic
design of a grow light is that you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: your bulb, and the bulb hangs
horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It screws into the socket, and it goes
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it shines, the light goes all
out of that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've put it inside of what we call a
reflector or a hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like what it sounds like it's
supposed to do, it reflects the light
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that light that goes up from the
top of the bulb hits that reflector and
[SPEAKER_00]: gets spread down onto our plants,
down onto our canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're paying for all that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to move that light down where we
want it, get those photons to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light bulb is basically an
umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as an umbrella that is
directing the light back down onto your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about, there's going to be a lot
of heat generated by that bulb,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that heat is going to come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat does rise, but that heat will come
down into the plant area, into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also rise up out of that
environment, that hood there, that duct,
[SPEAKER_00]: the shield, the reflector will rise up out
of there and start heating up the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thousand watt light puts off a lot of
BTUs of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I like to do is buy what
is known as a ducted hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got glass underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light goes inside the hood or in
the reflector and glass goes underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the heat cannot escape from that
enclosure and it stays inside of there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've added six or eight inch
flanges on either end of it to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can run ducting in and ducting out and put
a blower at one end and extract that heat
[SPEAKER_00]: from that light and get it away from the
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a carbon filter, then ducting,
then the light, then more ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that goes right out of the enclosure
if it's a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a warehouse, if it's into another
room, if it's a garage, I run that right
[SPEAKER_00]: out to another place just to exhaust that
heat, get rid of it immediately and never
[SPEAKER_00]: even makes it into the grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter, I'll actually dump that
into either a veg room or a bed room just
[SPEAKER_00]: to use that heat, utilize the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spending the money on the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's utilize that heat that I heated up,
get something out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my favorite light set up in a thousand
watt environment for a home grow or a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal project grow is a reflector with
glass at the bottom and the flanges at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end that is ducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that a vented hood so that I can
just move that heat right away from that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light and get it right out of the
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of archaic, but honestly,
when I'm trying something new in my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space, if I'm trying a new nutrient,
a new grow style, a new product or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything new, I run those HPS lights
because I've had the best results with
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the most experience with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to operate those very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of archaic, but it works really
well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a lot of LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been gifted LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: People offer me LED lighting and sometimes
I just go right back to those HPS lights
[SPEAKER_00]: just because they're reliable and I love
the way that they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, I always prefer
double ended Gavita HPS lighting for my
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next part of the question was
distance from the canopy to be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about a vented light,
a vented hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your light is not vented, this answer
is going to vary greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the hood is vented and I'm moving a lot
of air through there and getting that heat
[SPEAKER_00]: from that bulb away from that reflector,
I can get those bulbs, that reflector down
[SPEAKER_00]: super close to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the age and size of the
plant, I can get somewhere between six and
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 inches from the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound crazy, but you've got a
thousand watt light on a button and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of clones that are eight inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop that bitch down to about 24,
18 inches above those and then as they
[SPEAKER_00]: grow up, raise the light, raise the light,
and when the light can't go anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let those plants grow right up to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they're done, they may be six
or eight inches from that light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is ducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is vented, so they're not getting any
heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting bleached from the
light because they grew into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't just drop that light right on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them grow up into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew what they were getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: They adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They adapted slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on the plant size and the
plant health and how hot you are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep it cool, if you can move
that light, get it low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drop that light right on there,
you'll notice real stacked, tight,
[SPEAKER_00]: dense buds, real tight inner nodal spacing
that close to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about the law of the inverse square.
[SPEAKER_00]: The further we get that light away,
we definitely start diminishing the value
[SPEAKER_00]: of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a bigger footprint, but we don't
get the intense ... It's the law of the
[SPEAKER_00]: inverse square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about that with lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn a lot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot even delve into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, when it comes to lighting,
lighting definitely is not my specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about this really easily,
but when it comes to spectrums and numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: and Kelvins, my brain does not absorb that
info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lighting ignorant, to be mostly honest
with you, but for this thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: reflector, I would drop it real low.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using a vented reflector,
stay at least 18 inches above those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're going to get roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay at least 18 inches above or they will
get too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a fan going, move that heat around,
but I get as close as I can and I start
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I see the leaves curling up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they start giving me signs that they're
pissed off?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, then I just raise that light up
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to push things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes with experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've really got to just do it to learn
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, get in there and experience some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cook some plants, you'll learn what
the cook limit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you burn a pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pizza oven, the fucking box says,
leave it in for 12 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try it for nine, you check on it,
it looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You check it at 10, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave it in there for 13,
that thing's fucking toast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the thing is cool, you can get
it really, really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me talk about more of what you've
got printed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my room is a four and a half by
four and a half room and my ceiling is six
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely get a ducted and vented
hood if you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would definitely be ideal for that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on, it says, I have a 600 and
a 50 400 watt HPS system I can use,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm thinking about buying a thousand
watt HPS system to fix my stretching
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the two lights are equal or
lesser than a single 1000?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to touch on something before I go
too far, your stretch problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about other ways that could
help with the stretch because the light is
[SPEAKER_00]: a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is one great step to mitigate
the stretch, but is your temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity dialed in?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too hot, the plants are going to
start stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too dry or too wet, the plants are
going to start stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your nighttime temperature and
humidity like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How drastic are your diurnal swings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your daytime and nighttime temperature
and humidity within five or 10 degrees?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep those super close within
five degrees, that will drastically reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of stretch you get from those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things I've talked about is popping
the knuckles on the plants, doing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of LST, a little bit of super cropping
where you grab the plant and just twist it
[SPEAKER_00]: and give it a little, my knuckle popped it
into too loud, but give it a little pop
[SPEAKER_00]: sound there, that will slow down the
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things that could help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to do it with lighting,
one thing I would think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got two fixtures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that 400 watt system will run
a metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hear me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me if you think I'm fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were going to do this, I would run
the 600 watt high pressure sodium and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 watt metal halide together as close as
you can add, as close as you get them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but fairly close together in the dead
center of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a four by five room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not very big, a four by five
square.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 400 will get enough light down into
there, especially with such a low ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 600 will get enough light down in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put those right at the center of
the room and run both of them on the metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halide and the high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a lot of great effects from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The metal halide, the blue spectrum from
the metal halide will help you keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: light or that plant short and squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quick detail that I have forgot
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I used to say a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This detail just came to my mind as I was
rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are experiencing too much
stretch during the beginning of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing we can do to mitigate that
stretch is don't change your bulb until 14
[SPEAKER_00]: to 21 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the stretch phase is over,
then switch to that red bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running metal halides and HBSs,
the blue from the metal halide will keep
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants shorter and squattier and
more stacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see that stretch stop,
then switch over to your flower bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track to what I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use the 600 and 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do the 600 watt high pressure
sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do a 400 watt metal halide and I
would run them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do them on a 12-12 cycle and that,
honestly, I had run a crop in a five by
[SPEAKER_00]: five tent with, they used to make a
reflector called the Grozilla and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: hold two bulbs and I put just like this,
I put a 600 and a 400 in there and I ran
[SPEAKER_00]: those just like a thousand watt light and
that was some of the tastiest,
[SPEAKER_00]: most photogenic, densest, best,
most dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, some of the best weed I ever grew
came from that five by five with those two
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs running side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your situation and in your environment,
I do believe that the 400 and the 600
[SPEAKER_00]: would be better because it's such a small
environment that you don't need the super
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration from the thousand watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the spread from the two bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you've got one light source and
you get more shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got two bulbs, you have two
light sources and less shadows and more
[SPEAKER_00]: light spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one section is getting a bunch of
HPS, one section's getting a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide, but you'll get more light
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going super deep because your
ceiling is only six and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got very little penetration to
try to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do the 600 and the 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that is what I would do in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can make the 400 a metal halide,
that would be totally ideal for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: that halide will definitely reduce the
amount of stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you with your stretch
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can switch both of those bulbs to
metal halides until 21 days into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: then switch the big one out to the red
bulb, the high pressure sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that should make it bang for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should definitely give you some
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know you have an insane amount
of inside information on this specific
[SPEAKER_00]: topic, but I do understand that you get
thousands of questions per day and may not
[SPEAKER_00]: have time for this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I do get a lot of emails and a
lot of questions and I really do try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get anything that I feel like is useful
for the show that a lot of people can gain
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get those on the show as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever feel discouraged if I don't
answer your questions right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person said, I get thousands of
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 4,000 unread emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to read a lot of them over the
next couple of days and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I reply, I'll get 4,000 replies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying, I'm doing my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is written, produced,
hosted, edited, burped into the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone, all just by me, excuse me for
the kombucha burp there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for that, but it's all just
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing my best to get all the
questions answered, all the material
[SPEAKER_00]: covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get upset if you've sent me a
question and I have not answered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm compiling your question for the
appropriate episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two or three other people had a
similar question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to knock them out all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just not time for that question
or maybe it just didn't fit the format of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit rambling about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough excuse time with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sending me the great
question, my dude J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time rambling about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope people learn some stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we help people mitigate the
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pay attention when you're buying
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the breeders, at least myself,
I try to warn you that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: double or triple the stretch in a pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to read that when you're shopping and
buying stuff that may give you a big
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, why not LED for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says money and, and then it goes on to
say, in my research, there aren't many
[SPEAKER_00]: options for LED that truly outperform HPS
and anything larger than a four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple, but they are super
expensive and they run 650 to 800 Watts
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like all the LEDs are designed
for little tiny spaces and you got to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them and they are super expensive
to buy those lights at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upfront cost is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you save money on air
conditioning, electricity bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that initial investment does set you
back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion is that if HPS lights are
working for you, metal halides are working
[SPEAKER_00]: for you and you're not, you don't find the
LED that works for you, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of running your own grow,
the beauty of growing cannabis in your own
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is that it is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do what makes you happy as long as
you are satisfied with the outcome of your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody should tell you otherwise,
as long as you're not hurting anybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminating anything, poisoning anybody
or putting anybody in clear and present
[SPEAKER_00]: danger, do your thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the way that you want to grow from
your heart, breed with love, and don't let
[SPEAKER_00]: the haters sway you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's telling you something that
you're doing is wrong and you're happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with the way you're doing it, keep doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let, let yourself be open to suggestions
and have room for improvement,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't let the internet haters mess up
your game, your strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody on the internet wants to say,
you're doing this wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do this, but they don't even
know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know the rest of your project,
so don't let them fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing, grow with the lights that
work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that in the winter, my LED lights
do not keep my grow room warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that in the summer, those LED
lights are awesome because I can take down
[SPEAKER_00]: those HBS lights and not have to run half
the amount of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about the environment,
the space, the time, most importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always ask, what is the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: The best is what works the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I don't even have the best
because I have to change things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that LEDs are the best in the
summer and I think that HBSs are the best
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think something totally different
because your grow room is totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing, find what works best for
you, adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that my friend here said he's
done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my research, there aren't many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it because not enough people do
enough research out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, JH, I want to thank you once
again for a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has any
questions, corrections, comments or
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns, once again, you know I would

[SPEAKER_00]: You know I'll be back in a couple of days
with fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my buddy
Billy Podunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
See you next time.
