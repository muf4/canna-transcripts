[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, welcome to episode 458 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or autoflower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it has become a tradition that
we start this podcast off by talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Infinity
OG live batter from our friends at Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of under-dabbing Dog OG
and I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says the aroma and flavor
should be like gas, earth, and bitter
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gassy, it is earthy, and it is
absolutely skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this product
contains 67.26% THC and 0 CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the aroma and flavor of the
Infinity OG, and I think you can tell that
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a perfect buzz for podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at Green
Dot Labs for the Infinity OG live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode of the podcast,
I'm going to read a couple of listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I would like to do a
couple of shout outs to some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start with a giant shout out to our
new friend, St. Stephen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant Grow From Your
Heart podcast shout out to our friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Baked PWN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a giant shout out to our
friend, Victor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Grow From Your Heart podcast shout
out and a fist bump to our friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to send a giant Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to
our friend, Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to become a
patron and support the show on Patreon,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do so by visiting www.pwn.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to all of my
friends who have continued to help out on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I said I've got some emails I
would like to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that portion of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to send me an email,
if you've got a cannabis growing question,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got a cannabis culture question,
maybe you've just got something you'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, my email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email I'm going to read in
today's episode is an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I read an email
about a failed timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommended that our friend get rid of
that timer and get his plants back on the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct schedule as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind enough to send us an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to drop you an update on my issue
with my tab timer, especially since you
[SPEAKER_00]: answered my question on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for keeping in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, dude, I was super
stoked when I heard that shit just because
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt that my problem may have helped
another grower or a future grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that gave me a kick ass feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mistake or your equipment failure
actually led to you being able to help a
[SPEAKER_00]: few other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I kicked that tab piece
of shit timer out the back door when my
[SPEAKER_00]: new timer came.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look good so far, man,
and I've been checking over them pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I warned him that he had a light
interruption, so I warned him to keep an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye out for hermaphrodites or problems
with the plants because that may arise
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the light interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says so far, no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been looking pretty thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I may have lucked out this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics are fems from blim-burned
seeds, and they seem pretty reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are growing in soil with Blue Planet,
Farmer's Pride Line, and Recharge NA-10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you've got good
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who that breeding company is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't researched them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got some quality
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not hermaphrodite on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to say that that recharge in
there is what rescued everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on to say, thanks again for all
of your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the best part of the email,
it says, PS, the wife made me go get that
[SPEAKER_00]: timer from outside, and it is now in the
trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really funny because as I read
that portion of the message where it says
[SPEAKER_00]: you kicked the timer out the back door,
I mentally visualized you drop kicking it,
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing it up in the air a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of inches, booting it across the
backyard into oblivion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows where it went?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give a shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that happen, but then I thought
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, now there's a timer in
the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad your wife made you go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm even more excited that the plants are
not showing you any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you did not disrupt the
light cycle enough to where those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: hermed out on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad the plants are going to make it
through harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that you can stop looking for
herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may take a while to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not show up till week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not show up until week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they show up in week eight or week
nine, you do have a few options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a few things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can simply let them finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do have pollen, which is very
unlikely, they'll probably be sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably won't contain active pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do, that pollen won't have time to
pollinate and make any seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a big deal if it does perm way late
in the flower cycle, but keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_00]: that because that is a good note to take
and good info to have on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the great update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue to look at those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't get any problems in
the future and keep me updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions,
please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be happy to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, I dig your podcast and I
wanted to reach out and ask you a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more than welcome to use my first
name if you think they're good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Alex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: His question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just harvested about a dozen plants and
they were absolutely bursting with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really sucked because my yield was
super low and I'm sure my flower still has
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds buried in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier in the grow, I discovered two of
the plants in my tent were male,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm guessing I did not discover this
in time and they turned the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: females hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was those males pollinated
and they seeded the plants just like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those females were not hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those females never expressed male signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a hermaphrodite plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A female that shows you male sex traits
when it is stressed or maybe at any point
[SPEAKER_00]: in the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have got here is a natural male
pollinating natural females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is natural impregnation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what is supposed to happen
in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything went according to plan other
than you pulling those male plants out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that room before they were able to drop
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the important lesson there is next
time, you've got to be more diligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay more attention for the
males and you've got to get them out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another thing to learn, your plants
did not hermaphrodite and make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were impregnated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure we're using the
right terms so that we understand where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ever safe to grow in an enclosed
tent with seeds that are not feminized?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized seeds are just as safe as
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing in any type of
environment, there is no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are bred properly, if they are
done correctly, there is no difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the potency, the vigor, the viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will be noticeably different in a
feminized seed from a regular seed other
[SPEAKER_00]: than the fact that it is only a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend, Mr. Soul, recently posted
something to social media and he put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a very simple term that I think is a great
way to teach other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give people credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Soul is where I learned this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect to Brothers Grimm Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that Mr. Soul put it was,
when we are making feminized pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are basically removing all of the male
pollen from the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if I took a regular male plant and
I was able to shake that plant and I could
[SPEAKER_00]: identify in the air which pollen was male
and which pollen was female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine if I took a filter,
it was able to suck out all of that male
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of the pollen landing on my plants
are female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only putting female pollen on
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are only female chromosomes,
so I only have the potential for female
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how a feminized seed works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feminized seeds and regular seeds are
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are made correctly, feminized
seeds must be made from solid female
[SPEAKER_00]: starting parent stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the starting parents have intersex or
hermaphroditic traits, that trait may be
[SPEAKER_00]: passed on in that breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I am working with a solid female
plant, that receives pollen, that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed properly, I will only create
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those offspring will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is absolutely safe to grow in an
enclosed tent with seeds that are or are
[SPEAKER_00]: not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is you've got to pull
those males out before they drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to see a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what it looks like now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just got to pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pull it sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't get it out of there before
it pollinated, you were not paying close
[SPEAKER_00]: enough attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to look every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have been in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a grower's responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it is absolutely safe to grow
feminized or regular seeds in an enclosed
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I wrap up that section,
I want to give a big shout out and a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you once again to my friend Mr. Soul
from Brothers Grimm Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did borrow the quote about being able to
filter out the male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically what we are doing when
we're making feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more sections to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an easy way to tell if plants are
male earlier on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was checking for the little balls,
but really couldn't spot anything amiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plants actually start showing
flower much sooner than the females in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it takes the girls about
10 to 14 days for you can really look at
[SPEAKER_00]: them and go, that's a solid female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boys want to show right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, I got to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get taller than everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get my balls dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get my pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm eager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a teenage boy just trying to
get out there, just trying to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: attention, just trying to bust a nut,
trying to spread some seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boys will show you a little earlier
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have a good way to show you what
a male plant looks like through a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is your responsibility to get a book
or use Google and type in male cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or female cannabis plant and then
click on the images tab and look and see
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference in a male and a female
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be very easy to tell the
difference early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were paying attention, you will see
basically little hair like looking things
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see little nubbins, little acorn
looking things coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really obvious to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you weren't able to find that,
I don't think you were looking well
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you did the prerequisite
research on growing before you set up your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think you were in there
looking frequently enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had done some research and read a
book before you set up the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is always my advice, read some books
before you start growing so you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also pay attention to the plants
every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to touch every plant in your
garden every single day if you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a successful gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a couple of things that I
would recommend you brush up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some books, get some Google going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at some images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to visually identify a male
plant before you get three days into your
[SPEAKER_00]: next flowering cycle so we can prevent
this in the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can absolutely tell if the plants
are male, probably five to seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely 10 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've just got to get familiar with
what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part three of this question is if you have
super seedy flower and you pluck most of
[SPEAKER_00]: it out, but a seed or two goes through the
grinder, is this a really bad thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, back in the day, bro, we used to not
get seedless weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to get weed filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to buy a Mexican brick weed that
you'd grind it up and half of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless my buddy Randy was around,
we weren't getting all those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randy would make it a mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could give Randy your bag of weed and
say, here, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Randy would get all the seeds out like
that was his damn job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unless he was there, there was a good
chance you were going to smoke a schwag
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seed, a brick weed seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might make your joint pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might make your bowl pop a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might make it taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said you're going to put it in a
grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're probably going to put some
nuggets in the grinder, give it a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear those seeds go tink,
tink, tink, tink.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll fall through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dump that weed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the seeds out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the quality of those male
plants and depending on the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: those females, shit, you may have some
good quality seeds worth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not pass them on to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything with them now except for
grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow out a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have some completely amazing new
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have some total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I say you can't sell it or give
it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if it's worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waste your own time, energy, space,
and resources before you waste anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are free seeds, but they could just
be a problem if you give them to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do with those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you had a problem in your
personal grow, but this is an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to learn to identify the males a
little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have learned that those females did not
become hermaphroditic, that they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: became impregnated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned a little bit about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a good learning opportunity
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, and a couple other questions
about seedlings and clones in early
[SPEAKER_00]: stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've read a lot online how you
have to cover clones in a plastic bag or a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity dome for a while and the same
with new seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do that in a tent without
overheating them and frying them under the
[SPEAKER_00]: dome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would it be better to just run a small
humidifier constantly in the tent to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure there's enough moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks and rock on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they signed it from Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Alex, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things to touch on
in that last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've read a lot about covering clones
in a plastic bag or a humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do need to keep clones under some
sort of a humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones don't have roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a way to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a way to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to keep a nice moist environment
so that they can get all of their life
[SPEAKER_00]: from their leaves from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why we want to keep the clones
nice and humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we prefer a humidity dome
because it is much easier to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment in a little one foot shoe box
size section than it is in a five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: by eight grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to require a lot more
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to control that environment in
that giant tent, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be a constant struggle to
keep a grow tent inside of a room at the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct VPD at all times to keep clones
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be much easier to do so in a small
clone dome in a large scale commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we would have a room where the
environment is just right for the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't even need domes, but that is
a huge room with all of the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is dedicated to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tent is not in a bed room inside
your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is in a dedicated space that is
designed, built, and committed for
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to do the entire tent,
you can absolutely do that, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a challenge the entire way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not set yourself up for success?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a much smaller environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it is so common because it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have figured out a lot of ways to fail
and we have figured out a few ways to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you keep seeing the domes
pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is more specific and it
says, can you put the dome in a tent
[SPEAKER_00]: without frying them under the dome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent shouldn't be that hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent shouldn't be any higher than 70
or 80 degrees, maybe 84 degrees at the
[SPEAKER_00]: max.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that dome in the tent,
it's probably on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got it on a little shelf,
not all the way up at the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: but closer down to the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to get those clones fairly warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want warmth and humidity for those
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to cook them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put them on a heat mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they need a mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're not raging the
temperatures in that grow tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you plan on growing a crop
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be able to control the
temperature in that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, unless you're getting that room,
that tent up to some crazy ridiculous
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, you will be wonderful having
your clones inside of a dome, inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did that for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one small veg space and it was
inside of a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put my clones, flip a five gallon
bucket upside down, use that as a table,
[SPEAKER_00]: put the clone dome right on that fucking
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be just elevated, just high enough
to get enough lights where they would
[SPEAKER_00]: root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can put the dome inside of the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I do want to touch on that
you mentioned is I do not like to cover my
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings in any type of humidity dome or
a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave them open and exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my seedlings to get wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them to get a little bit stressed
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need the moisture like the
clones need.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings are developing a tap root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're exploding with growth at the
bottom equally as they're growing from the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully maybe a little bit more at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see more root growth than I like
to see plant development early on with my
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really need a humidity dome in
that type of situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of stress the seedlings out
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little bit of wind on them,
make them blow over a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in that warm environments they
start taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make them pussies from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my seedlings to sprout up and go,
ah shit, I got to get to work immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them to grow up and go,
ah, I can be a pussy for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why give them the option?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want them to be fucking soldiers
from day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't recommend the humidity dome for
my seedlings ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can absolutely put your clone dome
inside of your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will work perfectly for you as long
as that tent doesn't get over 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can absolutely, if you would
prefer, just fill the tent to the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be a constant.
