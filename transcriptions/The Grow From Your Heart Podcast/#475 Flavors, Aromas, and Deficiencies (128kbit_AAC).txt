[SPEAKER_00]: What's up podcast world, it is time for
episode 475 of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of garlic,
banger, live batter, from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is deliciously ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Headbanger and HSB,
which is Han Solo Burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
diesel and garlic, and that is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking open the jar now to give
myself a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells as soon as you open it,
gas comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like, oh, did somebody open up the
gas can?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you put your face a little
closer to it, it is garlicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost makes your eyes kind of itchy,
kind of burny, and makes your nose go,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is garlic and gas at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like you were eating Thanksgiving
dinner at the gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what this makes me think
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you dab it, that diesel flavor
and aroma hits you right in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of funky, sort of gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's followed up by that garlicky,
robust, savory flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sits on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a really nice cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the buzz just makes you want to chill
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me nice and lazy, kind of calms
me down, which is something I can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to be going a little bit fast
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious Garlic Banger
[SPEAKER_00]: live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to read a couple of listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that part of the show,
I would like to give some shout outs to a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of our friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big giant Grow From
Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to JM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you to Todd K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big giant thank you fist
bump to Blackbird76.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to Zoso J.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant thank you to Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to Keith K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to send a giant shout out to
Willie's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shout out to Jacob W.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I'd like to send a giant Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to
our friend Isaac G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
for continuing to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank everybody else out
there who supports the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show, all you have to do is visit www
[SPEAKER_00]: .patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode, I do want to
cover a couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a large mountain of emails
printed here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trying to work my way through the
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have sent me an email and it has
not made it to the show yet, please do not
[SPEAKER_00]: feel discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get to your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly get about a hundred emails a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I print out my favorites, I put them here
in the pile, and then when it comes time
[SPEAKER_00]: to record, I just start at the top and
work my way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email on the top of the pile today
goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, first and foremost,
I'd like to extend my gratitude for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time you invest in your podcast
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have listened to all but a few of your
episodes and have to say that the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of knowledge you have imparted on me is
incredible and I want to extend my
[SPEAKER_00]: gratefulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like starting the show like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for learning and thank you for
reaching out and expressing your
[SPEAKER_00]: gratefulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your show definitely makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people realize that a podcast
is hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think I just turn on a microphone
and ramble for 40 minutes and that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is that easy, but there is
prep that goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to come up with an idea for a show,
then I have to actually do the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is editing and there is posting
and there's a video and there's social
[SPEAKER_00]: media that goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of work that goes into a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that part of the
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I do have a couple of
questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the time, question number one,
you mentioned that you will do an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: on your specific breakdown of your use of
veg bloom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be very interested in this as I am
currently using their full line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see if there are some better
alternatives as I know you were using a
[SPEAKER_00]: blend of their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do still plan to deliver the nutrient
mix episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am writing that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be a lot of details in
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to ask a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am taking my time to write that show
down and have a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, I make a very minimal
outline so I can keep the show organic and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I'm having a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episode where I'm going to teach you
about my nutrient mix will be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am taking my time making that
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also was trying to get a couple of my
friends to be on the show for that
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, but the timing for that is not
going to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it is starting to snow here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting people to come to Pueblo from
Denver or Fort Collins is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am now writing that episode as a solo
show and I do plan to bring it to you as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as I feel like I've got the
ingredients and the instructions and the
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline documented properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know that the moment I drop that
episode, I'm going to get an influx of
[SPEAKER_00]: emails asking for more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to have specific
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to cover all of those details
and answer those questions before I put
[SPEAKER_00]: the episode out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to my last episode,
you'll know that I am just trying to set
[SPEAKER_00]: myself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good example of setting yourself
up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a second question in this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a small assortment of some of your
seeds that I acquired at the DGC 710 cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hesitant to pop these until I
can get some to keep in my genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that people collect my seeds like
they're baseball cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really bred those seeds to be grown,
but I really love that people have taken
[SPEAKER_00]: to collecting my seeds like they're
baseball cards or Pokemon cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who have got the entire irie
genetics collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got seeds from when I was
releasing grateful dog and heart of gold
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the stomper line that most
people never even knew about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, a lot of people have
all of the arise line, but some people
[SPEAKER_00]: have everything and some people send me a
message with their list and they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what am I missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I fill in the gaps?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have stuff that I don't
even have anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find that really impressive,
but I think it's really neat that my
[SPEAKER_00]: supporters want to support me in such a
way that they feel like they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect everything I release.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of respect and appreciation
for my supporters, my followers,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, my family, my fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them the irie army.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really means a lot to me that you guys
want to collect everything I put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust me, I do realize that without
you guys, I would not be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big respect and big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is there any way to source your
gear locally?
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Denver, but I am frequently in
the Colorado Springs, Pueblo area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would not be an issue for me to
travel to any of those locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend wants to grow out the irie
genetics seeds he has already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once he does that, he is going to have
a gap in his collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wants to know if there is a local
source for irie genetic seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, Colorado Springs, Pueblo area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, my seeds are not
available in any Colorado dispensaries at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may change in the year 2020,
but I do not want to make any promises or
[SPEAKER_00]: set any expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this current time, the best way to
acquire irie genetic seeds is through
[SPEAKER_00]: seedsherenow.com, dankseed.store,
or organeliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you are a Colorado local or if
you come to the Denver, Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo area and you happen to bump into
me, there is a good chance that I will
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lineup of irie genetic seeds with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also attend most of the large events in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a good opportunity to bump
into me at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Endo Expo is at the end of January.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is January 25th and 26th at the Denver
Mart in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those days is business day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those days is open to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can attend the public day,
I look forward to seeing you at the Endo
[SPEAKER_00]: Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, I also plan to attend the
Dude Grows Cup, which will be in April at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That event has not been announced,
booked or scheduled, but most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: we do that event the weekend before or
after 420 and it is at Cultivated Synergy
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is a consumption friendly event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to smoke a fat joint with
me, but at the Endo Expo, there will be no
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're coming from out of state and
you're trying to meet up and take some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs, the Endo Expo is a no consumption
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Cup, which has not been
announced or confirmed yet, but it more
[SPEAKER_00]: than likely will happen because I'm kind
of forcing it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm manifesting that it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a consumption friendly event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can smoke a joint and we can spend some
time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in Colorado, if you're in the
Denver, Colorado Springs or Pueblo area,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a good chance we could run into
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't run into each other
organically or we don't set something up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can find me at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not assigned me a booth number
yet, but I'm sure I will be easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be in all the advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: My booth number will be on the guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really large banner and I'm
also six foot five and I've got dreadlocks
[SPEAKER_00]: to my ass, almost to my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should be pretty easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find me at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't make it to the Endo Expo,
find me at the Dude Grows Cup at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I've said this before on
previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see me at an event and you've
always wanted to say hi, shake my hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a selfie, anything like that,
anything that's not creepy and weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tweet me tomorrow and say,
hey, I saw you at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like you were having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand and say, hey,
Rasta Jeff, I like listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or hey, Rasta Jeff, I like growing your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got some buds that you grew of
my genetics, come show them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to smell your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see your work, especially if
it's my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what's happening in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You listen to me ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my turn to listen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to meeting everybody that
listens to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're not in Colorado,
if you're not able to come to the Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: area and meet me in person, again,
I recommend seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, don't forget our friends at
Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the person that sent me this message
was a Colorado local.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to hanging out,
taking some dabs with you and talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about which seeds you want to sprout first
to start growing some iry genetics in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you didn't sign your name at the end
of the email, but you did put the words
[SPEAKER_00]: local Colorado grower in the subject line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out, big thank you to local
Colorado grower for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, let's keep moving through
[SPEAKER_00]: this mountain of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next email for this episode goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, big shout out to you and
white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, you just got a shout out bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that it's time for you to come
be on the show again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I do love listening to
you guys ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good thing because when Mike
comes on the show, we get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned and we sure do ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, I have been a
devoted listener to your podcast since
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing about it from the Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am quickly making my way through all
of the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you have found me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you found me through the Dude
Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, big shout out to my friends at
the Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the entire DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says every episode teaches me something
new or gives me some type of new
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I truly appreciate all of the work that
you put into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that means a lot to me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that I am sparking your brain to
think in a different direction or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: just making you look at the grow from
another angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of my goal because that's
that is how we learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep looking at things
straightforward, you're only going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the straightforward view.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a step to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all that other shit we can see
from over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go take a step to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of new shit you can see over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like knowing that you are learning
something new from each episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it really means a lot to me to hear
that I am giving you a new perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for telling me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you for noticing all of
the work that I do put into these
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that in the last message,
and it is a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going with this email because
I am getting rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email says the first question I have
doesn't really have to do anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, but more about identifying and
describing the seemingly limitless smells
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavors which come from the cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout Instagram and on your podcast,
I often hear people describe buds as
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling cushy, hazy or OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I try to ask someone what this
exactly means, the person has a very hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time describing it to me in a way I can
get a real feel for what I am supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question because
sometimes it can be challenging to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: describe some of these aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is challenging to put your
nose and a label on all of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: smells and aromas and all of this
different information we are receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's spend a couple of minutes talking
about some of the most common flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas people talk about when we are
describing cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the first one you asked about was
cushy, but I want to start with diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: because diesel is going to help me
describe a few more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason the strain diesel is called
diesel is because it smells like a barrel
[SPEAKER_00]: of diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a funky, sort of astringent,
sharp smell to it that kind of makes your
[SPEAKER_00]: nose, it makes my nose want to wrinkle up
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very chemically dominant kind of a
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing that smells like diesel
fuel other than diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why the strain diesel got that
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a bag of properly grown,
real deal diesel in your pocket,
[SPEAKER_00]: you smell like somebody just poured diesel
fuel in your pocket on your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very noticeable, pungent aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start this with that diesel
fuel aroma because most of us know what
[SPEAKER_00]: that smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it smells warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it smells like chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it smells sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I can feel it in my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like when I get too close to
it, it makes me squint a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also an underlying hint of skunk
when it comes to the diesel strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of diesel fuel and skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to build this flavor and
this aroma in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got diesel fuel with a little bit
of a skunk background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody was putting fuel in the
diesel truck and got sprayed by a skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the aroma that we are
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, it is really
delicious and really desirable when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So skunk and diesel are two great bases to
start with, two very obvious aromas and
[SPEAKER_00]: two things that I think people should be
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's work our way toward Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we say Kush, I'm talking about OG
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You listed the flavor OG and you also
listed the word Kush as flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sort of going to kind of fall
into the same palette here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush is a variety of Kush, but it is
the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one we should kind of base the
flavor on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then everybody bred the Kush to other
things and it started to dilute the Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to add bananas and strawberries
and oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got orange Kush, banana Kush,
but let's focus on the original OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've built a nice idea of what the
diesel and skunk aroma would kind of be
[SPEAKER_00]: like in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's kind of dial back the diesel
aroma a little bit and let's add a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of pine to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some fresh pine trees, maybe one of
those pine tree air fresheners you put in
[SPEAKER_00]: the window of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add some of that aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some skunk ass, we've got a
little bit of diesel feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are putting pine on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are starting to get a little bit
closer to that OG Kush flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on top of that skunk ass, that diesel
feel and a little bit of pine,
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to add just a hint of dirty
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough to make you go, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we've already got skunk and
diesel in there, but that dirty rotten
[SPEAKER_00]: foot, just a little dirty rotten foot
really makes the rest of those aromas pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds disgusting,
but that dirty foot aroma, it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to smell it and then you smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen on the original smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, oh, diesel and skunk and pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a foot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits you second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got fuel and skunk, then we've
put pine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've put a little bit of a dirty foot
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next aromas I want to add are a
little bit of dankness and maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of swampiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about like if you go into a basement
that's been sealed up for too long and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of smells a little musty,
a little damp, a little dank in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: that flavor kind of comes in at the end of
the OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts off skunky and fuely,
and then it's got that pine dominance to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a feet aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it finishes, it is musty and
funky and dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I hope I have painted a good picture
in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost taste some OG Kush right now
from all these descriptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there will be variations on this
depending on which Kush you are smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you smoking OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoking Bubba Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have Tahoe OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different Kush's
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, there are a lot of
plants and jars of weed out there labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush that do not have any Kush in the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the medical marijuana movement swept
Colorado, I watched everybody go Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the dispensary on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a big variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all smelled pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all had neat names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Kush got popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went on Monday and everything had Kush
at the end of the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Kush, Strawberry Kush, Blueberry
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that shit was called Kush last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just got popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody threw the name Kush at the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, that does work as a
great sales tactic in the medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're thinking about Kush,
you should think fuel and skunk and pine
[SPEAKER_00]: and feet and dankness, maybe a little bit
of swampy smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of think it's got like a warm and
savory smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Kush varietals will have a chocolate
or a coffee or maybe a dirt sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this depends on which Kush you are
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this will depend on how it was
grown and dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some things that Kush is
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush is not sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush does not taste like candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush does not taste like berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are getting product that smells
like berries or fruit, it is not real OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possibly some out-cross of a Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have like maybe OG Kush to Jilly
Bean will give you some orange flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe OG Kush to Blueberry would give you
a Blue Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it tastes too fruity, it is
probably not Kush dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good OG Kush is more on that gassy,
fuel, chemicals, pine, dank, musty,
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky, swampy, chocolate, coffee,
dirt sort of side of the aroma palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be very easy to confuse the aromas
of a good OG Kush with some of the Kim Dog
[SPEAKER_00]: or Diesel varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main difference is going to be
that darker pine, chocolate, coffee,
[SPEAKER_00]: swampy sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kim Dog is going to have that chemical
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have the skunk in the feet,
but it's going to be more on the like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh can of tennis balls or fresh tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to have that aroma in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit of a difference
when it comes to the Kims, the Diesel and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kushs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the only real way to smell
something is to smell something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend coming to Colorado,
heading to a legal state and going to a
[SPEAKER_00]: reputable dispensary and smelling some
good Kush and smelling some good Haze and
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling some good whatever else is
available so that you can kind of get a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice idea of what the different options
are and what different things smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's time for you to start
planning a road trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener does ask a few more
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask about Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we describe the flavor of Haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very unique flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe Haze as a sandalwood flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a woody flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I think Haze smells a little bit
like a gentle incense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also sometimes has a bit of a spicy
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I describe Haze as a green apple
sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sandalwood, it's incense,
it's a little bit spicy and it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: green apple flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder for me to describe the flavor
of a Haze because a Haze is not as common.
[SPEAKER_00]: A true Haze plant is going to take at
least 11 or 12 probably 14 weeks if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking the true Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be very unlikely that you
run into a true Haze plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find some Haze crosses just like I
was talking about the OG Kush but a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze is going to be very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things you can look for in a Haze flavor
like I mentioned earlier are that woody
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, sort of a sandalwood flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Hazes have a spicy green apple type
of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have got a sweet,
perfumey sort of aroma to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the Hazes I have experienced
have been a hybrid that were crossed with
[SPEAKER_00]: something else to reduce flowering time
because like I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good Haze takes too damn long to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very unlikely that you're going to
find a pure Haze unless you or one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: very close friends are growing it for
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know my description of the flavor of
Haze was not as nearly in depth as my
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor description of OG but that tells
you how much Haze I have been exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much OG Kush I have been exposed
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago in Colorado when
the medical marijuana market took off,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody went Kush crazy since Haze takes
so long to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it here in the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal cannabis cultivation market in
Colorado is already trying to find ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: pinch every penny and save every dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing a 12 to 14 week cultivar is
really not an option in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, there is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Being a relatively youngish
grower, I started smoking cannabis right
[SPEAKER_00]: after college and then began growing a few
years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am unfamiliar with what these strains
are supposed to smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this question is great for you
because you do a very good job at
[SPEAKER_00]: describing smells and flavors and seem to
have a real gift for doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that I did not have a
thoroughly detailed description on Haze
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think I made up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my great description on the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is still more to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last paragraph says, My other question
is, When should I expect to see fading in
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants for an organic grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am worried that the beginning of fade I
see earlier on in flower and then he says
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks four and five is a nutrient
deficiency I should deal with rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: an actual proper fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wraps the email up with,
Thanks again for everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will continue to support you via Patreon
and I will continue to look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: every new episode you roll out best and
then they sign their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want your name set on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this fading question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, When should I expect to
see fading in my plants in an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this listener is worried that the
fade is beginning too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener has plants that are in weeks
four or five and they are showing a fade
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are in fear that it is a nutrient
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is probably a nutrient
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what the fade is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toward the end of the flowering phase,
we like to flush our plants, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: we are removing all of the built up
nutrients from the soil, the soilless mix
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever you've got in your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just feeding water for 10 to 14 days
to rinse out that container so the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have anything to eat and then they
essentially begin to cannibalize
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will use their stored nutrients which
are stored within the plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start sucking that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically working off that fat
belly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they don't have a fat belly,
they're starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They begin looking a little bit yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what we want at the last
part of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing the plants, cleaning out all of
those nutrients will make that final dried
[SPEAKER_00]: and cured bud taste delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So later in flower we look to see what we
call the fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to watch those leaves slowly
turn from robust lush green leaves to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of faded out yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cultivars will get really unique
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some purples and oranges and
yellows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a nice fall display come out of
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend here has this happening way too
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is happening in weeks four and five,
which means we have got a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without more info, without some pictures
or some details, I cannot identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are at week four or five in an
organic grow and you are seeing yellowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to be struggling until the
end of this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are doing what is called chasing the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are never going to catch up with that
plant's appetite for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did state that the grow is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using a super soil
or some sort of amended soil or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were feeding teas or maybe even organic
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do need to increase your feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may recommend some type of a foliar
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will really suggest is don't
try to correct this issue by radically
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing your feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A major increase in feed is only going to
cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would carefully diagnose the issue with
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you feel like the plant is
deficient in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it showing a nitrogen deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it phosphorus or potassium deficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it need CalMag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's correctly identify the deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's use the appropriate amendment
to fix that deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, again, if you're using super
soil or teas or an amended soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what the solution will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're using organics, many of those
products will take several days if not
[SPEAKER_00]: several weeks to break down and become
bioavailable for that plant to uptake to
[SPEAKER_00]: help solving your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to help this plant out by
directly spraying these nutrients onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray undiluted nutrients onto the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to foliar feed,
mix up the appropriate nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute it very, very light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need strong nutrients directly
applied to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very low ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then spray that onto the plant and then
watch the plant recover over a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not go in there and think my plant is
nitrogen deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to feed the fuck out of it with
a bunch of nitrogen and fix this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to increase the nitrogen a little
bit and then feed it frequently and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you probably will not be
able to catch up to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves that look like shit will
always look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are really terrible, pull them
right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that the new growth is
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carefully identify the deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's increase that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how you're going to deliver
that nutrient to the plant because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know your style of grow, but it definitely
sounds like you were fading too early
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have got a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did use a super soil or an amended
soil, it needs to be a little richer next
[SPEAKER_00]: time or you need to veg for less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I know I keep saying this,
but without seeing your plants and without
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more information, it's hard for
me to diagnose exactly what you were
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does sound like you are
experiencing a nutrient deficiency in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before somebody out there starts
typing an email, let me address what I
[SPEAKER_00]: just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did recommend foliar feeding these
plants that are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to struggle all the way
through their life if we don't take
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're four or five weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am assuming these buds are not giant and
chunky because they're nutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one or two foliar feeds at the
right time will rescue these plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: not cause too much risk of causing a
problem to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't get any bud mold because there's
not bud there and we're not spraying a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide, so it is not going to
contaminate our final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're typing an email because I
just told somebody to foliar feed in week
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five, just hit cancel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as those buds aren't giant and
chunky and as long as we're not applying a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide and as long as we don't
completely soak those plants like a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: sponge and then close the room up and let
it get stagnant, I think that this will be
[SPEAKER_00]: a good idea to foliar feed those plants
with the correct nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will assume that you want to keep
your garden as organic as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: but think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the organics will take time to
become bioavailable to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is already struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt-based bottled nutrients are much more
bioavailable to your plant and will be
[SPEAKER_00]: uptaken by the plant almost immediately
upon that nutrient finding a root.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have much more success and much
more chance of rescuing this plant if you
[SPEAKER_00]: bite the bullet and use a non-organic
bottled nutrient to attack your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to stay organic, disregard
that advice, but if you really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: rescue these plants, it may be time to
think about switching it up and adding a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-organic ingredient to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if that's not something you're
interested in doing, totally disregard
[SPEAKER_00]: this section, but it may be your best
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do really hope you were able to rescue
this crop, and I want to thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was sent a while back, so it is time
for an update.
