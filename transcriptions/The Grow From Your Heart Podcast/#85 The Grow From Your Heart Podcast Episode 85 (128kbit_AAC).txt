[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 85 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're a new smoker or a veteran
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[SPEAKER_03]: or if you're someone who's just curious
about the current state of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, they call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_03]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.

[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everyone's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 7, 10 PM, so everyone's sitting
here taking some fat dabs at the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me introduce to you our super
photography expert, our dab master.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just making shit up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our cannabis photography guide for
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my good buddy, Joe, to my left.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you for having me.

[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to make up a name for this very
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming to my dining room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Eyre dining room.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go, the Eyre table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to call it Sticky Knob Studios a
long time ago, and somebody told me that
[SPEAKER_03]: that just sounds disgusting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's because there's hash all over
everything now after taking so many dabs,
[SPEAKER_03]: but ladies and gentlemen, directly in
front of me also here joining us on
[SPEAKER_03]: microphone is my good buddy, Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing well, doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're all a little bit high,
so there may be some giggles here in this
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since we're talking about dabs,
this is a good time to give a big shout
[SPEAKER_03]: out to our friend Bobo Blaster Co.

I were sitting at the coffee table,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking dabs, just chatting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it beautiful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful over there.

[SPEAKER_03]: I will get you all of the information that
you need to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's enough ads.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, let's get down to business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I invited my good buddy Joe over
[SPEAKER_03]: because we want to learn a little bit
about you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust you and respect your opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I brought you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slop Series is going to chime in once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to do this episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to have another fat dab
session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to record an episode
featuring our good buddy Slop over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's jump into the photography with our
good buddy who is almost an expert in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion, Joe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we want to do is improve the
listener's photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I just say that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, what we want to do is improve
their photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the main thing that I'll start
with is what you guys need to do is think
[SPEAKER_03]: about why are you shooting photography?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your point?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to do it for advertising?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to do it for magazine shots?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you simply just trying to be cool
on social media and get a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: followers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's going to make a huge
difference in a lot of the equipment that
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to purchase.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much what I came up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I wanted to ask Joe if he could
elaborate on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then also if he could help us select a
camera for our purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly that fits our budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make any sense to you,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're doing the social media thing,
stick with your phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your phone is an amazing device.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine megapixels, 10 megapixels,
even more in some.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you have the proper lighting,
that phone will do everything that you
[SPEAKER_04]: need.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the point and shoot, if you're a
blogger, somebody who's taking pictures of
[SPEAKER_04]: food or friends, little videos here and
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're filming YouTube videos,
point and shoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a point and shoot two to five
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: $500, $600 if you want to really go crazy
on them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get an amazing blog-worthy,
internet-worthy camera, all the
[SPEAKER_04]: capabilities that you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then like you said, advertising and
really, really want nice pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put them on blogs too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly no limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you must have the top camera
quality in all aspects, that's definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: the DSLR, a digital single lens reflex
camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, there will not be a test,
so you don't have to try to remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know what it means,
but I know that that's what it stands for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the acronym?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I didn't ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe proved the point right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just think about what you're shooting for.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just trying to be on Instagram,
if you're going blogging, you don't need
[SPEAKER_03]: to spend a million dollars on all of your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just trying to shoot some
Instagram pictures, if you're trying to be
[SPEAKER_03]: a Twitter guy, if you're doing Facebook,
you can use your phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the new iPhones, the Samsung
phones, my iPhone, six takes amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the new phones, you can get really
quality pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into lighting in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to be, you know,
I've had a magazine shot and I did not use
[SPEAKER_03]: a super expensive camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used a $200 camera for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not all about the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is about the settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is about the lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is about learning where to
shoot from and maybe a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: editing, but we'll get into that more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So select a camera that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the best camera you can for your
budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first bought my camera,
I was intimidated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought a point and shoot camera and I
feel like I almost, I didn't waste the
[SPEAKER_03]: $200, but if I would have put that money
toward my nice DSLR camera in the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning, I would be further in shooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be intimidated by a camera with a
lot of settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the new DSLRs, I think all of them
have an auto setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can learn through that auto
setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most all new cameras are extremely user
friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Manufacturers know who they're making
cameras for.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know what their audience is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you've never used, as long as
you're technology capable, as long as you,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, be technology capable by any camera
you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you will be able to figure it out if
it's not on your own through experimenting
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube is always a good resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just type in this camera and then the
question you have about it and it will pop
[SPEAKER_03]: up 17 videos and watch a couple of them
and filter out the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause every one of those guys is going to
tell you some weird thing that is
[SPEAKER_03]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just watch three videos and figure out,
do the math on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the median.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So select the, figure out why you're going
to shoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Select the best camera you can for your
purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to go shooting for
Instagram, don't buy a thousand dollar
[SPEAKER_03]: camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy the D30 for Instagram shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, if you want the best
pictures on Instagram, you will have the
[SPEAKER_03]: best, probably some of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want the crispest, that's not a
word.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want the crispest pictures,
how many times do we have to say a word to
[SPEAKER_03]: make it a word around here?
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't take long.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then select, get the best camera you
can, you guys, and then learn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also while you're shopping,
there are a couple of accessories that we,
[SPEAKER_03]: we talked about this a little bit before.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are definitely some accessories that
we would all recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: While you're shopping, get yourself a
tripod.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get a, sorry to interrupt,
don't get a cheap tripod.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there are tripods out there for 20
and $30, which will work, but they're
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic and they, they're soft.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not meant to last and they're
not meant to really be hauled around and
[SPEAKER_04]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not going to haul it around
and you're just going to leave it in one
[SPEAKER_04]: place and take pictures, always buy that
20 or $30 one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the difference between a $30 tripod
and a $70 tripod is giant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's metal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very sturdy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to last forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will last as many cameras as you could
buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ruined my $30 tripod quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The height adjustment stripped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's stuck at one height.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to move it up, I got to like
yank it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got the $70 Dynex one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they have at Best Buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, great investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tripod will make your pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your photos will be not wobbly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to leave the shutter open a
little bit longer because you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: holding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no matter how steady you think you
are, you're shaking.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way physics works, think about
like a flashlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you turn the flashlight, you make a
nice arc with the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing that with the lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not just wobbling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're waving the whole end of the lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the part that's shooting is wiggling
in a much, yeah, that's you're making a
[SPEAKER_03]: cone shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's science.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll, we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also get yourself a nice case.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can get a bag, a soft bag or a case
or something for the camera, do that
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're going to want to carry
extra lenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to want to carry a lens
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need the little soft cloth to clean
off the lens, especially when shooting
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lens is freaking sticky all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I got to clean it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get too close to the plants or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just you touch it and then it
trichomes all over your lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Old cotton t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No socks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use a sock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually a fresh sock.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that's soft, you know,
don't use like anything soft.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to tell you what not to use,
but it's really okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't press too hard to scratch up the
lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I personally like to go to the
sunglasses store and get that little rag
[SPEAKER_03]: that they use to clean your sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microfiber cloths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Microfiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that works perfect for my camera
lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then don't skimp on the case either
cases, backpacks, you know, a $70,
[SPEAKER_04]: a hundred dollar case, you know,
you're putting a thousand dollar camera in
[SPEAKER_04]: it, maybe true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a thousand dollar lens,
you know, what's a hundred dollar case if
[SPEAKER_04]: versus a $50 case that gets thrown at the
airport or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about initial investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pelican case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pelican case is not too shabby,
especially if you're traveling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the best way to not get your
camera stolen out of your vehicle when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're traveling?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cover it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang it on your neck and take pictures
with you while you're running around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the damn thing with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know when the craziest shit
happens when you don't have your camera
[SPEAKER_03]: with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can like almost guarantee you're not
going to get robbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to get jacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: There won't be a catastrophe if you've got
your camera on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't save Anthony Cumia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the greatest reference on this
podcast, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Opie and Anthony.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get yourself a good tripod.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself a good case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some lenses now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of lenses for shooting cannabis
photography?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you recommend a few lenses?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give any like specific
lens to get just because everybody,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I don't want it to be bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you say, oh, this guy said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But are you trying to take pictures of
trichomes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you trying to take pictures of buds
off the plant, on the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to take pictures of the whole
plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Different lenses are going to do different
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get, you know, shorter focal
length plants or plants, shorter focal
[SPEAKER_04]: length lenses for portraits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just really general.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get all different, there's all
different kinds of lenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each camera is going to have different
lenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each brand is going to have different
lenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're just talking about DSLRs right
now, because that's the only thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: lenses really apply to, you're buying your
lens and your body separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're buying them in a box
together, it's set, you're getting that
[SPEAKER_04]: for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're buying the body that you want,
because the body has all the features that
[SPEAKER_04]: you want, and then the lens, because that
lens has all the features that you want,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just depends on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it says body only, they're sending
me a usable camera with no lens,
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's misleading.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not know anything about that when I
was camera shopping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what the hell does that mean,
body only?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wondered if there were mechanics inside
of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's misleading.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like just the plastic or is there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that said, you can certainly get
lenses that fit all applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get like the telephoto lens,
it's telephoto and telemath, macro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I use just as the easy lens for all
aspects, I use it, I think it's an 18 to
[SPEAKER_04]: 200.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Nikon lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a nice range.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that fits anything that you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to take a picture of a mountain,
you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to take a picture of a tricolm,
you're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a huge... I get the 55 to 200 in
my case right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's... This is my go-to lens right
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one I use quite often.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything that you needed to do without
getting too specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So guys, what I use, since Joe approves of
my setup here, I'm using the Nikon D3200.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I bought the package that comes with
the case and the two lenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I usually use the 55 to 200 lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I want to get in there,
sometimes it's hard to maneuver around the
[SPEAKER_03]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't back up from the plant,
if you're up close, then I'll switch to
[SPEAKER_03]: the... I'm looking at the right number so
I don't mislead anybody here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the 18 to 55 is the one I use when I
can't maneuver around the room too well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm further away, I go for this longer
lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm close in tight, I use the 18 to 55.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get much better shots with this 55 to
200 lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my go-to right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we're saying all of this,
basically to take the macro shots on that
[SPEAKER_04]: 55 to 200, you put it all the way to 200
and on a tripod, and you're going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: about 18, 20 inches away from the NUG with
your 200 zoomed all the way out into that
[SPEAKER_04]: NUG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how you're getting your macro
shots in that specific ... Zoomed all the
[SPEAKER_04]: way out or all the way in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're zoomed into what you're
trying to ... On the 200?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your 200 is extended as far as it will go.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You set it to 200.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the lens is out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on your viewfinder, it's zoomed in on
your subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's where you find your macro
setting in that lens.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's in these types of lenses that
do everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've been off the mic for so much
of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got you up loud enough to where I
think we can get you in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are mics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are lenses that do everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to take pictures of just
trichomes, really close up things going on
[SPEAKER_04]: in your garden, you could take awesome
pictures of soil, who knows what you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: find in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could take pictures of whole NUGs,
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get a dedicated macro lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that won't take pictures of
mountains, something that won't take
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures of your family, no portraits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just little tiny stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just little things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get the right lens for the right job is
kind of what you're trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do your research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for something that's going to shoot
in five to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all about full resolution on big
prints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, if you have an eight by 11
picture of a trichome and it's perfectly
[SPEAKER_04]: in focus and beautiful, that's because
somebody was using a five to one lens that
[SPEAKER_04]: would allow you to shoot that whole frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're zoomed into lifelike.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're zoomed into real life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically people got to know what
they're aiming for and that can lead us
[SPEAKER_03]: into another part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to kind of skip a little part
of the notes that we made.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting so off track here.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the one skipping it because I like the
way that it's flowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It flows better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of just shooting at random shit,
kind of plan out your shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since Joe's talking about your lens,
you're going to have to know what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: aiming for when you put this lens on your
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't go putting on your macro lens
and then try to take a picture of the top
[SPEAKER_03]: cola.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get your 200 lens out to take
pictures of the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of know what you're aiming for,
plan your shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about, like Joe said, if you want to
take a picture of a tricone or if you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to take a picture of some soil,
think about it and you'll see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you walk through the grow room,
something will go right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it catches your eye, that means
it catches the camera and try to stand
[SPEAKER_03]: where you were when it got your eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to replicate that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be scared to take a lot of pictures
of even the same thing and then there'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be that one that's just like, this is the
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have the time to, I don't know,
take some dabs and look through your
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: The magic of memory cards.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not wasting film anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just clicking away on a memory card.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're wasting RAM and we can delete it all
and do it all over again tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just plan out your shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choose the right lens for your shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to make a correction on that,
with the 200, the 55 to 200, when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: at 200, I don't want anybody to think that
you can take a picture of a tricone with
[SPEAKER_04]: the 200.
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't work that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was kind of thinking that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take a picture, you can take
really close up good shots of nugs on your
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could take where you will see each
individual tricone as a dot, sometimes the
[SPEAKER_04]: stalk, just depending on how good the
lighting is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't think you're going to get that
real, super official macro photography
[SPEAKER_04]: without a macro specific lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wrote something down to try not to
forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go into lighting next
because you just hinted on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys, one huge hint I can give you
just super quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to get yourself either a Method 7
lens or... Oh, I totally forgot about
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we both forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can just put the sunglasses right
over your camera if you're ghetto.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That works.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that does work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Method 7 makes a filter that cuts out the
HID, the high intensity discharge light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It cuts that color out and you can see the
natural color of your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not able to take the plants
out of the room, the Method 7 lens is a
[SPEAKER_03]: good way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's work into lighting a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: How should we be lighting our cannabis
plants when we're taking pictures?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ideally not around HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even T5 lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's super white.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks good, but it's not the true
representation of your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It puts a little bit of a blue to it,
I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could put any hue on it just depending
on the other lights in the room or a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of factors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: What it's reflecting from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's easiest?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, get in a room with really good
outside lighting or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a whole bunch of CFLs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty flat white, easy to color
balance off of your camera if you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: get into your settings and do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have that and you have to
stay in your grow room, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: turn the HPS lights off and just turn your
overhead light on and use a flash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: A flash will overcome a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the stock flash that came on most of
our DSL cameras going to be DSLR cameras?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that going to be good enough or should
we get like a ring like an aftermarket
[SPEAKER_03]: flash?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can afford an aftermarket flash,
it is going to be a lot far superior to
[SPEAKER_04]: the one built in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that one that's built in is not too
shabby either.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will definitely get the job done for
most applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're getting an aftermarket flash,
you should really know why you're about to
[SPEAKER_04]: spend $160 on a flash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there's reasons for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to tell you what they are
because that's cheating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Figure out the reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll get to some reasons later.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So more lighting is usually the key,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: More lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: More lighting, the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunlight, if you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunlight's the most ideal, but I know
everybody can't take their plants outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite meme is the old lady looking
out the window and it says, there's my
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbor taking pictures of his bongs and
the sunlight again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see it on Instagram all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I do because I follow usually pot
plants, glass and pit bulls as my
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some booties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try to get back on track slot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wrote down settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of settings should I throw?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it cool to just walk in there on auto
and start auto firing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get pictures that'll be useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might not be the best, but they
certainly will be usable compared to if
[SPEAKER_04]: you just throw it in manual without
knowing anything, you know, it'll probably
[SPEAKER_04]: just be black.
[SPEAKER_04]: But settings, when you don't have ideal,
I'd say throw it in auto for the most of
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason to not use auto.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have great lighting, auto is the
best setting just because it will
[SPEAKER_04]: continually correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will just make everything easy and
pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can focus on taking the pictures,
especially if you're not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you don't need to be 1000% perfect on
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're just for your Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to be all critical about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, if you want to be critical,
more power to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's part of the art.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So settings are going to be for if you
want to take pictures in the dark,
[SPEAKER_04]: just using flash randomly to overcome the
HPS or when the HPS are on and you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: change the setting in your camera to
filter out that on the fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid to change settings,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something you're going to have to
learn to do with the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something I've just recently accepted
is that every shot I may have to change a
[SPEAKER_03]: setting or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize it was going to be that
way when I started taking photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I could just go in there and put
it on, you know, put the after setting
[SPEAKER_03]: here, turn the ISO to here, put the white
balance here and just go in there and
[SPEAKER_03]: shoot from every angle and it'd be legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you want to shoot from, you want to
take all the pictures you want to take
[SPEAKER_04]: from the, without moving basically,
uh, stand in one spot, take all the
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures you want to take and move to the
next spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take all the pictures you want to take and
do it systematically.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not trying to tell anybody
what to do, but that's what I find,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially when you're going through your
pictures and everything is grouped.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're going to be sitting down,
standing up, leaning over, leaning
[SPEAKER_04]: backwards in one spot without moving too
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really get a good feel of what that
angle is bringing to the table.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't be afraid to take weird angles,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the best shots are really weird
angles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Experiment, have fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang off of a ladder upside down backwards
and take a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good shit comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about settings a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got lighting, we got lens selection,
uh, sloppy brought up a great point
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, slop asked me, uh, what is acceptable
editing for cannabis photography?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Joe had a great answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you give that answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just don't, don't edit maliciously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, by that Joe means like myself,
I'm a seed breeder, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I own a company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were to edit the photos I take of the
plants that come from my seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it would be misleading.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I edit out the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: I edit out people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I edit out other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's another plant next to it,
I'll go ahead and blur that one,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't edit the subject, uh,
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time, like 99% of my Instagram
and my website are all unedited.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they are edited, you can tell cause
it's black and white or it's something
[SPEAKER_03]: awkward.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're in there making the pistols
pink and you're trying to sell a pack of
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and those pistols weren't pink,
that's what we'll call malicious editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're doing it for art,
like if you're doing it for like,
[SPEAKER_03]: look at this beautiful cannabis plant,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're trying to take credit for
growing this beautiful plant, don't go
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking with the colors of misleading
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try to trick anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Editing is a lot of fun though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are certain instances,
uh, when you have to edit, like if you
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't, you know, you're not always in
the best condition for pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't always have the best opportunity
to take a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you just have to snap,
snap, snap, snap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you got to come back to some
Photoshop and clean it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is acceptable at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends on what you're doing with
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, now that you've learned how to,
uh, select a camera, you've got all your
[SPEAKER_03]: accessories.
[SPEAKER_03]: You figured out what kind of lenses you're
going to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a cool light to play with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you've been tweaking on the camera
settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: You learned how to do some editing and you
just got to get there in a grow room or
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever your plants are and just take a
shitload of pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys just take pictures, change the
settings, uh, play with the settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said earlier, don't be afraid to
get out of auto.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get out of auto mode, I like to
take pictures in auto.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then take a note on where,
what auto did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auto will say everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auto put the ISO at this or the white
balance or the shutter speed or the
[SPEAKER_03]: aperture setting was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auto will take a note for you in the photo
if you save it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then look at that note and then write
that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you've got a really killer
picture, try to duplicate that setting in
[SPEAKER_03]: that environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then remember like when I was in this
setting, this environment last time I
[SPEAKER_03]: threw on this setting and I took really
killer pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll start making mental notes
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll just, it'll start coming naturally
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really nifty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that it did that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, uh, it shows on the camera,
if you, so if you save it, if you've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: decent camera, a good expensive camera,
it'll show you what the settings were when
[SPEAKER_03]: you take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, a lot of those cameras
are also putting a GPS locations in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to go turn that setting off in
your camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys turn off your location is the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shut that off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No good metadata in your camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, and then go take pictures,
you guys, and then just start planning out
[SPEAKER_03]: better shots, just start shooting more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll learn how to set it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll learn how to get to a better
setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll learn how to plan out your shot,
frame your shot, and then you'll learn
[SPEAKER_03]: more how to edit them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think that'll put you on the
way to making amazing photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can have 17 to 25 to 55,000
followers on Instagram and you can be in
[SPEAKER_03]: the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take notes when you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slop, how many Instagram followers do you
have over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think I have like 1734.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when you moved here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 400.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've gone a long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I've covered all of the notes
that I have written down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that Joe's got a little,
uh, uh, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bullet point thing over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show them something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing really that I would want to
say is use the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an amazing resource for everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, anything that you want to learn
about anything, especially photography is
[SPEAKER_04]: out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people who have blogs and
YouTube channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a guy that calls himself fro grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's got a YouTube channel on
photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, a lot of photographers are kind of
stale to watch because they're good at
[SPEAKER_03]: photography and not personal presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But fro grows is definitely, uh,
educational and entertaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying is find somebody
that you can, uh, watch and watch them
[SPEAKER_04]: work and you can learn a lot from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, it's such a crash course
sometimes on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just show you exactly what you want
to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Slop, you got anything to say over
there, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: You look blazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be scared to use your imagination
and just get in the grow room and get down
[SPEAKER_02]: on one knee or look at it from a weird
angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take pictures from inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The possibilities for pictures are
endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your imagination is the only limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, and imagination is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've got a great podcast here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should start wrapping this up while
we're ahead, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely.
