[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I picked up a jar of sour diesel
HCFSE that is high cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract from apothecary
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you crack the jar open, it looks like
little diamonds or little rocks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just straight chunky crystals of sour
diesel, high cannabinoid, full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, it says this product
contains a total of 89.7% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really love the buzz from the sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes straight to my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes straight to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel a little bit anxious,
but I kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the buzz I am shopping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also picked up a nice jar of lemon
OG high terpene, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mainly just terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little jar of just terp water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little viscous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little thinner than maple syrup,
but about that texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is much more clear than maple
syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice clear yellow color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part is this amazing lemon OG
Kush aroma coming out of this jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a little portion of the HCFSE,
the high terpene, full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid terps, and I gently poured that
right into my jar of sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a nice little lemon OG sour
diesel slurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I dabbed that, I honestly had to
take a moment and get my life together
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was so, I was high as shit,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to put my head in my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to catch my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went and took a few minutes on
the couch to myself just so I could make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to get my brains back together before
I came and did this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short version of what I'm smoking
today is sour diesel, high cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract, coated in lemon OG,
high terpene, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has gotten me in the perfect mood
to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a great podcast topic lined up
for us.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're moving in on four minutes
into this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I am finally done with the
intro and the business part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work my way into the main topic of
today's podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to focus today's episode on the
coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to talk about the COVID-19
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am mainly going to focus on how this
virus is affecting us here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, more specifically here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I wanna talk about more how this
virus is affecting the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: also how it may affect other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to talk briefly about being
prepared for a lockdown or a quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: for our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have all of the supplies you need
for yourself and your family and your
[SPEAKER_00]: pets, but have you considered what you may
need if we are quarantined or locked down
[SPEAKER_00]: and we need supplies for our grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need regular love and
care, just like we give them today,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like we were giving them before any
sort of weird outbreak, any sort of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: social situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants require a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people rely on their plants for
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people rely on their plants for
income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have spent a lot of money on
seeds, equipment, electricity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and products to keep their grow alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot let these grows die simply
because we are facing some adversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: some awkward social situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, we're going to work
our way into talking about being prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lockdown situation in a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have what you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already getting ahead of myself,
so let's back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I wanted to talk about the
coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're gonna start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you have been living on the other
side of the moon, I am going to assume
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody knows what the coronavirus
is by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has seen the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has read the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has chosen how they are going to
accept and believe the stories of the
[SPEAKER_00]: coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are really freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are kind of ignoring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people are in the middle,
watching patiently, wondering what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not judging you for your position in
this fear and hype moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what feels best to you as long as
you remember to think and stay
[SPEAKER_00]: compassionate and have empathy and
remember that everybody is in this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not every man for themselves at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not every woman and child for
themselves at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is everybody together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not only responsible for taking
care of yourself, we must all take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are freaking out about this
pandemic, if you are completely ignoring
[SPEAKER_00]: this pandemic, or if you're kind of in the
middle, waiting it out, wondering how to
[SPEAKER_00]: react day by day, that is okay as long as
you don't forget that you are not in this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are millions of other people
dealing with the same shit as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to be compassionate to
every person on the planet at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also must take responsibility to not
spread this virus to sick people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be young.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be laughing about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is your nana healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your papa healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everybody around them healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a sick child in your family?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be the person that thinks you can go
out in public because you're young and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and you will be Superman and not
cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the potential to pick up this
virus and carry it to other people and not
[SPEAKER_00]: know it for several days, potentially two
to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go outside yesterday and pick up
the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't know that you are even exposed
to it for possibly two to three weeks if
[SPEAKER_00]: you even ever show any symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people don't show symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very likely that healthy people
don't show symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you go visit your nana, but you're not
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got coronavirus in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to nana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give her a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now three days later, nana is sick as fuck
and you may have killed nana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not kill nana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love nana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love papa.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandparents are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of glad they don't have to deal
with this fucking coronavirus shit because
[SPEAKER_00]: it would have killed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not kill other old people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm healthy, but I'm staying away from
elderly people because I have been around
[SPEAKER_00]: other people who have possibly been
exposed to the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I have or have not,
but it is definitely a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out and about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been many places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be surprised if I had the virus
in my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be surprised if many young
people my age range, my health range,
[SPEAKER_00]: have this virus and show zero symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be spreading it to older people
and fucking up lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm off on a rant here,
but my point is be responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you don't show signs and
symptoms doesn't mean that you can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: giving this to older, sicker,
immunocompromised people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think about everybody in this
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be selfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I am going to try to back myself up
off of my soapbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like I just got really
preachy and ranty, but this is important
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have older people around us,
and we need to learn to have
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility, empathy, compassion,
and patience for everybody in this time of
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am trying to unite everybody
is what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not all be a sucker for fear and
hype, but let's also not get the older
[SPEAKER_00]: people sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have to go anywhere,
don't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have to be somewhere,
don't be somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can avoid groups and people,
avoid groups and people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be with your loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be with your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some time in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up that crap in your grow space that
you've been ignoring and avoiding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to get all that silly shit
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take advantage of this time while we're
taking a little bit of a quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: period, a little bit of social distancing
and catch up on chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch up on all the shit that you've been
neglecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use this to your advantage and let's not
get any other people sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I am going to be a complete hypocrite
here and I'm going to tell you the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: that I realized I may be fucking up with
this coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly was on the fence with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm not really going to take
that seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like some more fear and hype
planted by the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff that the conspiracy
theorists sort of say, that all got to my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I went to a comedy show at
ComedyWorks in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks is a fairly small club.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quite intimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The building holds approximately 300
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comedy show I went to was sold out and
has been sold out for several months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comedian I was going to see is very
famous and brings a large crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew something was strange because on my
way to Denver, I-25 was almost empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever traveled I-25 in the
afternoon on a Thursday, empty is not the
[SPEAKER_00]: word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a fucking headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to punch yourself in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rear end people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wish it was a Mad Max situation where
you could just blow all the fucking cars
[SPEAKER_00]: up around you and get through the
interstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to Denver in about an hour and 45
minutes and it should usually take me two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and 20 to get to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the interstate was empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got to Denver, Denver was empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got to the parking garage where I
usually have to drive around for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes and search for a spot,
the parking garage was empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gas station on the way where I stopped
to pee was empty and they would not allow
[SPEAKER_00]: people into the gas station until you
properly sanitized your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a hand sanitizing station
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in line to sanitize your hands
before you went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you were allowed to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I had to do was pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the road for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to pee real bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sanitized my hands, went in,
went pee like I needed to, came back out,
[SPEAKER_00]: re-sanitized my hands again because I just
went pee and I was going to get in the
[SPEAKER_00]: car, make sure I'm clean, got back in the
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I bookied up to the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the parking lot was
completely empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line to get into the comedy club was
fairly low.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got into the comedy club,
I realized it's almost showtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are only about three quarters of
the people here that have bought tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little section in the back of
ComedyWorks that was completely empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that club is completely full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells me a bunch of people
abandoned their expensive comedy show
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets for a very popular comedian for a
show that was sold out months in advance
[SPEAKER_00]: and they did not even bother to come to
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when I was sitting there at
ComedyWorks debating on if I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: order snacks or if I just wanted to get a
bottle of water as my beverage and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: not touch anything and keep myself safe,
I think that is the moment when I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: this is something serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be making a mistake being here in
this large group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another part of me said, what are you
going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to live in fear forever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy is your favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to come to comedy shows and
this is one of your favorite comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shut the fuck up and enjoy this for an
hour and a half and we can freak out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ride home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered a bottle of root beer,
which was nice because I haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming much sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that root beer was really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of a snack and then I
chilled out and waited for the comedy show
[SPEAKER_00]: to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the comedy show started, I completely
forgot about any fear, any worry,
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy is one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quickly fell into the comedy zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comedy show was hosted by a comedian
known as Georgia Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time I heard of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be a fan for life because she was
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a little bit younger than me,
but she's a Colorado person and she's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pot smoker and she's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be following her comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comedian on the bill was a guy
known as Kevin Christie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am pretty sure that I have heard Kevin
Christie on Bob and Tom years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a great presence to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of got a don't give a fuck sort
of a vibe to him what I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that divorced dad sort of a
comedy vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really enjoying his energy and his
jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started the show off with something
about, hey, Denver Comedy Works,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we really brave or really stupid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, I guess we'll find out
in about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody kind of laughed and looked
around like, fuck, he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really funny because we had all
just kind of, I don't know, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: there at a comedy show, you just give up
on the outside world and you just laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good comedian will make light of a
shitty situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is exactly what Kevin Christie
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were off to a great start at the
comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a wonderful hostess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a wonderful feature act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the headliner came on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am excited because
I finally got to see Bobby Lee live on
[SPEAKER_00]: stage at Comedy Works in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Lee was fucking hilariously awesome
live on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Lee is mostly known for his time on
Mad TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also got a podcast called Tiger
Belly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also on another podcast called Bad
Friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to and watch everything Bobby Lee
puts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I did not realize when I saw
Bobby Lee live is he is super comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a maniac on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude is maybe five feet tall,
but he commands the stage like a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that come from the Comedy Store
in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: have a special power of confidence on the
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Lee tends to play that he is aloof
or not fully aware of what's going on or
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's kind of disassociated with the
situation or he's not fully paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have discovered that that has got to be
a fucking character because when he was on
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, he never missed a beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on point the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would do crowd work and he would ask
the crowd a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he would reply, most people have
body language or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would not respond to your answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would make a joke about your body
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was so rapid fire that it was
impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen countless comedians on
countless stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bobby Lee was one of the most
comfortable people I have ever seen on a
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that was really impressive
is how much Bobby Lee plays with the
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was flirting with one guy on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was making fun of another guy off the
stage the entire show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would keep coming back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one time he took off his shirt for
another joke, which we'll get to here in a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tried to get a guy in the front row
to touch his stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when the guy reached for his
stomach, he grabbed his hand and made the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience member palm Bobby Lee's dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's Asian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, ha ha, I trick you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Bobby would have done that to a female,
there would have been a crime involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will not be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Bobby Lee for his amazing
fucking content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the things that
I really like about Bobby Lee is that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: so confident on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I noticed is Bobby Lee got
involved in a one on one conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: an audience member.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a person up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Lee was setting up a joke,
but he had to give the audience member a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a prompt, a little bit of a
joke and tell him he had to give him a cue
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell him what he needed to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was setting up the bid a little bit
while Bobby was setting up that bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crowd got restless and we started
chatting amongst ourselves, which happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stop telling jokes, the crowd will
kind of fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it is hard for a comedian
to get the crowd back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost about 250 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took Bobby two words to get the entire
crowd back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could hear him talking to the other
guys like, so when I say this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to say this and you'll do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Bobby Lee goes, OK, fuckers,
comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a fucking joke for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as he said, I'm going to do a
fucking joke for you, everybody was back
[SPEAKER_00]: on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was full focus on the joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bobby Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're a public speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're a comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a fucking impressive superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen comedians lose the crowd before
and it's hard as shit to get them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Lee said, hey, fuckers, I'm going to
do a joke for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just took one prompt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all back.
[SPEAKER_00]: May sound weird to a non-comedy nerd,
but that was amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highlight of the Bobby Lee show.
[SPEAKER_00]: One highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Lee gave a full on dirty blowjob to
a microphone stand, deep throated it,
[SPEAKER_00]: got it all slobbery, drooled on himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about halfway through, he realized I
have got coronavirus from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the moment in his face that there it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't be doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I heard the switch go off in his
brain and he realized it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, fuck, I'm sucking this microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm completely going to get corona.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most hilarious part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ruin for anybody who may
go see Bobby Lee in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that I have seen Bobby Lee
naked and I was in the front row of
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks and I've still got that image
burned in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go look at Bobby Lee live on
Instagram, you will see the exact image
[SPEAKER_00]: that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Lee put on rubber gloves because of
the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby Lee put on a surgical mask because
of the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Bobby Lee stripped down to his
underwear, which were way too baggy and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of his cash and prizes were hanging
right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all got to see Bobby's little fupa
and his poorly shaven ball sack and his
[SPEAKER_00]: disgusting butt crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I haven't laughed that
fucking hard in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joey Diaz made me laugh one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theo Von made me laugh another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way that Bobby Lee made me laugh
made it feel like something in my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: could come undone at any moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I could have a stroke or a
fucking seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like elementary school laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just when the kid in elementary
school is just so fucking stupid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't stop laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was experiencing from Bobby
Lee being naked on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We agree to not take out our phones and
take photos or videos at ComedyWorks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a moment when I had the best
photo opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just wearing his little underwear
and his surgical mask and his rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves and he had the microphone in his
hand all awkward and he had his legs
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed sitting on a bar stool directly in
front of me just giving a speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was thanking the crowd for coming
basically because he said, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if I should even show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know if you would show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You people that came are bad
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo opportunity I had was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I wish I would have taken that
shot, but I didn't want to get kicked out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did not take out my phone,
but it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Bobby Lee was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me laugh and forget for quite a
while that we're facing some weird
[SPEAKER_00]: situations in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to send a big thank you to
everybody at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say that every time I talk about
that club, everybody at ComedyWorks treats
[SPEAKER_00]: me like I'm a VIP, like I'm a fucking rock
star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect it and I love you guys so much
for the fucking superstar treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's send a big giant shout out to
Georgia Comstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That young lady is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will be famous one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to Kevin Christie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Christie is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's already somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's only going to keep rising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course I want to send a big huge
thank you like a sigh of relief kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you to Bobby Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby really let me let go of some stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me kind of forget about the crap that
was going on outside of that comedy club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really made me feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to everybody involved in
that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send another shout out
because I made a new friend that evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up at the comedy club by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited a friend at the last moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That friend couldn't get the day off of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited another friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called another friend who ended up
being sick and having pneumonia or
[SPEAKER_00]: bronchitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that friend couldn't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: After inviting three people, I decided I'm
going to drive up to the club and give my
[SPEAKER_00]: extra ticket away because I can have fun
at a comedy show by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to sit there and laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm doing is paying attention to a
comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the club and I said,
hey, bro, I don't need my extra ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let the guy at the door know there
was an extra ticket that is always polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if somebody is waiting outside
trying to get into the show, they know my
[SPEAKER_00]: extra ticket is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can give them or sell them that
ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it to be polite to let the comedy
club know that I bought a seat that will
[SPEAKER_00]: not be used and it is now available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can capitalize that on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can resell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can put someone in that seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empty seats cost money in clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got kind of a little VIP thing at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always end up down in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: They expected two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saved me two seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the next weirdo to show up by
himself got sat next to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked out kind of well because I met a
huge comedy fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a giant fan of Bobby Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big fan of most of the comedy shows
I listen to and the podcasts I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few which we completely don't
agree on, which I find to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes good friends and good
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my new buddy Hayden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great meeting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great chilling out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fun taking a dab with you and I hope
everything is well with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to doing another comedy show
with you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my quick breakdown on going to
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: My quick rundown of going to see Bobby Lee
at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is when I decided I need to quit
going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to quit doing shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to do some shopping and get some
supplies and hunker down and stay here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the stoner cave, in my man cave,
in the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to chill out and not expose
myself and not be a contagion and not
[SPEAKER_00]: spread this shit any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've been trying to do for
the past few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got plenty of groceries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't buy excessive shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got enough for myself and people close
to me for several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get more stuff at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get more trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll bring more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have to buy it all in the first
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that was about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why did you buy 17 cases of toilet
paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are you going to shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't buy food and you bought a
lot of toilet paper, that's poor planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up eating the toilet
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that works because maybe it will
auto wipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only benefit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and got myself a bunch of supplies
and now I'm hunkered down here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't plan on going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are going to start
restricting movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have restricted group sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have started closing many
establishments starting tomorrow in my
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bars and restaurants and places of
entertainment will be forced to close
[SPEAKER_00]: their doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where this talk gets serious,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coronavirus is finally starting to
have huge impact on a lot of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of us didn't take it seriously at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us still are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think now we are going to start
seeing major impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it impacting me personally?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has already impacted me because the
dude grows cup has been postponed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were planning to do the dude grows cup
in April in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an event where irie genetics does
a lot of vending.
[SPEAKER_00]: That covers a lot of my costs for the next
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without that event, I don't have that
income.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am already feeling it in my wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the first hit to our economy
that I am experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first major thing that I am
experiencing due to the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: A major event where a lot of my friends
were traveling from out of state and also
[SPEAKER_00]: out of country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were coming to Denver to hang out,
to meet me, to network.
[SPEAKER_00]: To grab seeds, to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff has been canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the 420 events are going to be
postponed or canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be doing 420 in July this year,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be 720 this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things are going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is already one dispensary that has
announced they are now closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very close friend who has a job
at a local dispensary and they spent half
[SPEAKER_00]: their day today checking their phone to
see if they work tomorrow and hoping they
[SPEAKER_00]: still have a job after tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their corporate manager does not know
and will not know until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably sometime tomorrow afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody is in a state of confusion
and flux and panic right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my friends in the service industry,
all of the bartenders, the wait staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the restaurant folk, they are all out of
jobs right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the people in the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got several friends in the
nightlife, entertainment, and music
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the musicians are shit out of luck
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the people that cook for you,
serve you drinks, and perform for you are
[SPEAKER_00]: all scared shitless about their economic
future right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, we have not officially been
quarantined or shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are very strong rumors that we
will be quarantined.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire nation will face some sort of
quarantine and we will be locked down and
[SPEAKER_00]: confined to our homes for a undetermined
length of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to predict all of the problems
and ripples that could come from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to lose jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to lose careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is going to change because of
this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I am building up more fear and
hype, but this is the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to happen eventually,
you guys, is maybe the grow stores may be
[SPEAKER_00]: closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I was working toward in
all of this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow stores may get shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our supply chains may get shut
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are not allowed to go to work,
if we are not allowed to leave our houses,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we cannot be in groups, how are
supplies going to move from the warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: to whatever store they get to?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no truck driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nobody at the warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nobody at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not allowed to go to the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to be able to get our
supplies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, there is a solution to food and
basic supplies like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But non-essential supplies will be put on
the back burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow supplies are going to get loaded
on the truck very last.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is room on the truck after they
have stocked all of the food and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical necessities to take to
whatever area that truck is going,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is a pallet of grow supplies,
that may make it on the truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, that is going to be a back
burner scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to get any of
the extra shit that you do not need that
[SPEAKER_00]: is not essential to survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to do when we start
running out of supplies for the grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared for 30 days of survival
outside of the grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have food and water and vitamins
and whatever medicine you take and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentials and medical supplies?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, do you have everything to keep
your plants on the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepared for 30 days of survival
outside of the grow room?
Do you have food and water and vitamins
and medical supplies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have food and water and vitamins
and medical supplies?
[SPEAKER_00]: The probiotic farmer guys, they are
already ahead of us in a worst-case
[SPEAKER_00]: end-of-the-world scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel that they have an advantage
because if they can grow cannabis in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of scenario, they can grow anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be going to them to get our
fruits and vegetables when they harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we'll be going to them to help
them man that farm so that when it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvest, we can get what is fair for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not just there leeching off of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can contribute and help a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the growers who rely on the
bottled nutrients, who rely on the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store, who rely on that truck or Amazon to
come every once a month and drop off all
[SPEAKER_00]: your shit, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to adjust?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get that bottle of base
nutrients, do you know what to use to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you made some sort of a plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever thought about what happens
when you run out of Cal Mag?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when I run out of pH down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to do your grow without
all of the shit from the store?
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly never put too much thought into
this situation until I was at the store
[SPEAKER_00]: stocking up on supplies for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wondered, do I have all the shit I
need to keep my plants alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure I do because I work
with some great companies who send me bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got an accidental stockpile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I didn't have that accidental
stockpile, I don't know how long my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies would have been stocked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly don't know that if I run
out of bottled nutrients and all my store
[SPEAKER_00]: bought powder nutrients and all that stuff
I've gotten from all the hydro stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: my vendors and my friends, do I know what
to go outside and grab to be able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for my plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know if I've got that
ability without doing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I've got friends like Jesse and
Sean, and I've got the entire internet to
[SPEAKER_00]: rely on to help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it came down to it, I don't know
that I could keep those plants alive for
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a couple of weeks without
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will survive for a while without
nutrients if they're healthy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got nutrients stored up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually those plants are going to
require more than water, which brings up
[SPEAKER_00]: another really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough clean water to feed
your plants in a worst case scenario?
[SPEAKER_00]: We may run out of drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the bottled water is gone at the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every store in my city is sold out of
bottled water everywhere for about 50
[SPEAKER_00]: miles of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bottled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thirsty, hopefully you've got a
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, drink from the hose like we did
back when we were kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no bottled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have water for your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some sort of reserve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have backup water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that water clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be kept potable and usable for
your plants or drinkable for a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes down to it, are you going to
drink that water or are you going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it for your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be time to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am hoping that this coronavirus
situation is just a short teaser and an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye opener and an example of what could
come in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope we don't see another major
pandemic or something like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm hoping this is just a heads up,
a learning lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this is like Mother Nature or the
earth or whatever God you believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this is your God saying,
hey people, you've kind of gotten out of
[SPEAKER_00]: hand and you didn't prepare properly for
big problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you that I can
decimate your planet in just a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I hope this is a learning lesson
and I hope it is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has gone way too far for me to say,
I hope this blows over quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I hope it's almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it has reached its peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it is on the down slope now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we're coming out of this and I
really hope that the entire world takes it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a learning lesson and I hope we all
learn how to take this shit seriously and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's all learn how to identify and
respect this sort of a problem when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes up next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I feel like I got super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few bullet points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went right through them really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like a chaotic episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I had a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I got it out clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part in all of this is
that we take care of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I say that a lot, but that is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we have if we don't have each
other?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing if we're doing it for
ourselves and not for everybody around us?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to think about our families.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to think about our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to think about the elderly
people and we've also got to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: the children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is far too easy to get selfish in these
times in this world with all the social
[SPEAKER_00]: media, with all the self-absorption and
self-consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to be self-consumed Let's
open our eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's open our hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's share our love and energy and
anything else anybody else needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spread it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are facing so many divisions in the
world today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's from a virus, if it's from
politics, there are so many things trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to divide humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more important now than ever that we
all stick together and love one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
thank you for listening to me ramble for
[SPEAKER_00]: way too long about the coronavirus.
