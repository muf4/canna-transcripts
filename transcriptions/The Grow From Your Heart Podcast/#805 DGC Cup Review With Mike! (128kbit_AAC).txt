would come into play in this story Very as
[SPEAKER_02]: a very big key player in this story So as
soon as we got out of the car,

[SPEAKER_01]: so we're only at the hotel for 90 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run into a half dozen people Yeah,
we're already seeing parts of the crew
[SPEAKER_02]: that put a really cool uh A party vibe
into the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The drive wasn't stressful up there,
but the drive wasn't the most relaxing
[SPEAKER_01]: drive We could have asked for two
near-death experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wild So once we got up there,
we kind of shook all that off We saw hi we
[SPEAKER_02]: saw Billy and as soon as we saw Billy and
hi we knew yeah We're like there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: party you guys so we checked in with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the pre-party?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a VIP party, but as the dude
grows cup goes there's always A pre-party
[SPEAKER_02]: before the VIP pre-party.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody flew into town So we figured out
where everybody was going we went to the
[SPEAKER_02]: hotels and kind of dropped off some stuff
and then uh Went to food bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went got some tacos man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How were the tacos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tacos were edible tacos were not like I
wouldn't head back there real fast But
[SPEAKER_01]: they were good enough to get the the party
started notice I didn't say the name of
[SPEAKER_02]: the place before I asked you the tacos So
we got some tacos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the job, you know, we weren't
starving but they have done We gathered up
[SPEAKER_02]: and we went down to a little place in La
Porte a little farm a beautiful farm in La
[SPEAKER_02]: Porte I don't know the name of the folks
that let us use their farm But thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: if you ever see this if you hear this your
farm is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a wonderful place Thanks for
sharing that with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a perfect place for the dude grows
cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the right size I like how it's Three
left turns to make it secluded three right
[SPEAKER_02]: turns whatever and then you're just kind
of in the middle of nowhere But right
[SPEAKER_02]: there in the middle of everything it was
super Beautiful great place did the little
[SPEAKER_02]: creek running through really set a good
vibe the division that the creek created
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty cool So we pull up and as soon
as we park you could just feel the vibe of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pre-party Everybody was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was most of the time at this event
They do those little individual 10 by 10
[SPEAKER_02]: pop-ups every breeder every brand has
their pop-up Everybody's got their own
[SPEAKER_02]: little island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a big was probably a hundred by a
Big-ass tent just one big circus tent for
[SPEAKER_02]: all of us crazy stuff owners to go party
under there and then they sectioned off
[SPEAKER_02]: little sections for each breeder to have
their table, but we showed up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-party and I grabbed just a table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw an open table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like right there Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go dab I had my rig with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a bunch of stuff claimed a spot
claimed a spot a Couple minutes later all
[SPEAKER_01]: the ivory army arrived in ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes So we made a smoke circle a nice big
Boy Scout circle with their camping chairs
[SPEAKER_02]: and they were eating They serve fried
chicken and all kinds of good food to the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all grubbing Everybody got a
plate Mike and I just went Eight,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I wasn't hungry, but they served a
bunch of good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody grubbed down I've got a really
cool family picture of everybody just
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting in a big circle eating dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I felt super cool That's when the
vibe really started kicking in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep That's what that's when it got real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's really cannabis cup time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's go Yeah, so everybody's
chilling in these circles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking pictures everybody and then
after everybody ate we Smoked and we
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked so much at the pre-party that when
I woke up on Saturday My eyes were redder
[SPEAKER_02]: than the grow from your heart logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably down there in the corner
My eyes were redder than that little red
[SPEAKER_02]: spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I had drank a mouthful of sand
in my sleep I took me about an hour to get
[SPEAKER_02]: my life back together on a shake off that
buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not complaining But wow, that was a
yep a fuzzy night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, put ourselves through some stuff I
woke up in the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice still isn't right Yeah,
like my throat was just PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go drink hot water until I can
breathe drinking hot water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep Just got the tap hot started just
splashes of hot water on the doesn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: I could breathe again man drinking hot
water to breathe again Just is the
[SPEAKER_02]: opposite of what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy how we handle things
differently that made my body feel weird I
[SPEAKER_02]: know tea is hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the secret man If you got a sore
throat or smokers throw a little warm
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: See I fired up the shower and got that
steam in there That's what did it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're right and that's hot water
You were fighting dads and Paul and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting devs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sneezing before we left anyway,
um, we woke up quite crispy and Separate
[SPEAKER_02]: hotel rooms were gonna have quite crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was uh, I don't want to listen to
this dude snore It's funny if they put us
[SPEAKER_02]: several rooms away from each other at the
hotel, but it still worked out I got a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter of it was so quiet as soon as you
could you left the room You could hear
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the hotel, but in my room was
perfect silence Yeah, my room sounded
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty busy with space in the parking lot
is between VIP party and cup day It was
[SPEAKER_01]: like six hours of blackout.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so lit that yeah, I didn't even hear
all the traffic outside I slept with my
[SPEAKER_02]: window halfway open at the hotel Because
it was raining and it was so nice out
[SPEAKER_02]: there such a beautiful time It rained the
whole time you guys but it did not matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody even cared We didn't even notice
the rain it kind of chilled out for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit, but it was constantly
sprinkling So we had a big old tent Nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: even cared people stood in line for their
their taco trucks and their Kona ice and
[SPEAKER_02]: their pizzas Didn't even seem to care that
it was raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first night was a big part of you
guys We hung out we smoked I got to take
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs with a lot of the cool kids that I've
been hanging out with on Discord Billy
[SPEAKER_02]: bong was there Petra was there the
Infamous hobbit feet was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna miss somebody if I try to list

[SPEAKER_02]: big shout out to all the people that came
I got to take dabs with The whole crew
[SPEAKER_02]: that hangs out on discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: I people that I didn't even realize were
gonna be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They popped up I was like bro,
it's you you're not driving the bus today
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cool to see some of those people
that are always on discord with me I got
[SPEAKER_02]: to see them face to face shake their hand
Give them a fist bump smoke a dab smoke a
[SPEAKER_02]: joint with them Mike was quite popular too
Mike hasn't been on the show in nearly a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred episodes and I was shocked Yeah,
people were looking for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta get back on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel really guilty Yeah, well,
that's part of why you're here now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm no more guilty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I worked y'all So the pre-party was
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The VIP party was an excellent time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to see a lot of great people Yeah,
that was the VIP party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you want it was um was really
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was You know the growing up they
weren't us so many times like don't meet
[SPEAKER_01]: people you bet on the internet in real
life And it was such a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, sometimes you need to go meet
some internet Friends and have a real good
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a real good weekend with some
internet friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just the pre-party guys That was
just Friday night Eventually the dude came
[SPEAKER_02]: and he turned on the lights and turned off
the lights and made us all pack up and go
[SPEAKER_02]: home Boo to the dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just joking bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it was because of the city of La
Porte We know it's cuz the dude was tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came and shut down the party made
everybody go home Dude, I love you bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just picking on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all went back to the hotel Some
people went out and partied and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized it was probably the best move
to go hydrate And go get some rest because
[SPEAKER_02]: not everybody else was a vendor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all competitors and chillin So I
went to breakfast the next day and
[SPEAKER_02]: stumbled in hours later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were there For all the vendors we
showed up kind of toward the middle of the
[SPEAKER_02]: vendor arrival We weren't first we weren't
last but it took us a little bit to get
[SPEAKER_02]: set up because We kind of had one of the
more elaborate extra extravagant boots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like yeah the that nice heavy
banner it takes a second to set up looks
[SPEAKER_01]: really really good, but the folks with a
little cloth banner like I understand
[SPEAKER_01]: those advantages that look really light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah I've got a I've got a couple
people on my team helping me out Shout out
[SPEAKER_02]: to Mike for helping me out the whole DGC
Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to all the people that helped us
carry shit, too Yeah, everybody threw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's such an awesome little community
and for the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all family people It's not a huge
open to everyone event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So It's just like a whole bunch of
brothers and sisters and uncles and
[SPEAKER_01]: cousins helping out with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome I think there were 320
tickets sold plus whatever VIPs and vendor
[SPEAKER_02]: passes and Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there was about 350 people there
at most times at times It felt like way
[SPEAKER_01]: more but it always felt like the right
amount of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was perfect Yeah, they were talking
about if they want to expand it or if they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to keep it the way that it is and my
vote you guys do Scotty if it matters at
[SPEAKER_02]: all keep it the size it was it was perfect
if you make it any larger you have to add
[SPEAKER_02]: more infrastructure which will mean that
you have to add too many more people to it
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep the vibe that it's got to make it
to add more infrastructure is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: cost enough money to offset that cost you
got to add too many more people keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that it is that's my vote but it's
your event dude I'll keep coming dude one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing we should talk about is what I
called the murderers row of vendors in our
[SPEAKER_02]: section it was our table and then Who was

[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah hot rod Hot rod actually placed in
the cup and when he went up and took his
[SPEAKER_02]: award He said that he could not have done
it without his wife.

rise B grade seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not top shelf looking seeds.

round and colored as most seeds are that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think are a grade So I couldn't sell them
as a grade sees I got what I call some B
[SPEAKER_02]: grades.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still grow amazing plants They just
they're ugly seeds But ugly seeds make
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty plants.

gentleman unsuspecting gentlemen walked up
[SPEAKER_01]: three unsuspecting Before the guy came up
and owned his joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said with confidence They'd walk up
to us and say hippopotamus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Just laughed and gave them seeds because
I knew what it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah, you're you're close,
bro You're close but first person that
[SPEAKER_01]: came up to me and said hippopotamus I
walked him through until they got kangaroo
[SPEAKER_01]: and the second person I was just like,
oh man, it's the trend now the third one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew what had happened immediately I was
like somebody told somebody the password,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they did it like It got telephoned and
eventually that kangaroo became
[SPEAKER_02]: hippopotamus which hey whatever I'll give
you free seeds random old stoner that was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know what?

[SPEAKER_02]: down here on my list of stuff to keep us
kind of on track on this podcast It's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the map I spilled coffee on I
can't figure out where to get through this
[SPEAKER_02]: canyon over here But we're gonna talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the word cup moments Are there
any significant moments you want to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: the people about here on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: That you remember from the cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was the one of my favorite
cannabis cup Moments, there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: little cup magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Serendipitous little moments that
can't be explained with rational anything
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was a moment with Tardis and a
gentleman by the name of John I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: yes who are from a different state and
John walked up To the booth and said hey
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed you last year Check this jar of
vortex that I have out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to smell it and that's just
sort of how the high Jeff Conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: went at this cut at the VIP party Jeff
laughs and goes vortex, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: If my buddy Tardis shows up, you're gonna
have to show him this and then Jeff sniffs
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar and says that's awesome hands it
back and gets distracted by something next
[SPEAKER_01]: to us and As he gets distracted Tardis
appears out of the fucking vapor He was
[SPEAKER_01]: summoned it was goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, what's going on and we all kind
of laughing like no way We literally just
[SPEAKER_01]: said your name you got to smell this and
he looks at John who's holding a jar of
[SPEAKER_01]: vortex and they look at each other funny
and He smells the jar of vortex and gets
[SPEAKER_01]: excited and it happens to be his favorite
Fino of the vortex And they're giggling
[SPEAKER_01]: like schoolgirls and then it dawns on them
that they know each other from home
[SPEAKER_01]: because they were accosted in public by a
crazy person together as Strange they're
[SPEAKER_01]: strangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both happen to be on a street
together and a crazy woman accosted them
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happened Insanely enough that they
registered like oh I looked at you and I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember you from that and here They are a
whole nother state away at a cannabis a
[SPEAKER_01]: cup High as giraffe pussy and one of them
has the others Favorite herb and Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: summoned the moment out of the vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful Everyone laughs about it
the whole week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just weird cannabis serendipity the best
part about that is If I'm on discord in
[SPEAKER_02]: the evenings and I'll be like,
hey, where's Tardis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's Tardis time We haven't seen
Tardis in a couple days if I say his name
[SPEAKER_02]: he will pop in he's probably popping into
discord right now going Why are you saying
[SPEAKER_02]: my name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta what's going on like or Or the other
option with Tardis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's eaten like 8,000 milligrams of THC
and he's taking a nap with his camera on
[SPEAKER_02]: Tardis likes to pass out with the camera
on but here's a good story about Tardis
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just gonna talk more about my buddy
Tardis ate one of those I think it's 840
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams is honestly what I think his
edible dose is He ate that early in the
[SPEAKER_02]: morning He had an edible that our friend
Terps gave him Terps warned everybody eat
[SPEAKER_02]: this when you go home and go to bed But
Tardis is like I'm a robot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he ate it I looked over a little while
later and he's sitting at Duke diamonds
[SPEAKER_02]: booth straight up asleep He was out just
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like an hour later, he walked by my
booth and he's like, what's up Rasta?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude looked like nothing ever even
happened to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was fine We'd nap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So recharge you dude That you owe Scotty
real 50 bucks every time you say recharge
[SPEAKER_02]: it's okay Scotty real Oh you 50 bucks
every time either way one of the ways shot
[SPEAKER_02]: at Scotty real get some recharge get some
grow dots Dude that little VIP bag was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty cool It came with grow dots a
little pipe Little one hitter for the cup
[SPEAKER_01]: it came with a little poker that everyone
lost immediately immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea where mine ever went Yeah,
the the trick with the little one hitters
[SPEAKER_01]: was trying not to clear it into somebody
else I just kept spinning it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor like shooting it into the ground
next to my booth Like a spitball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was so you said most of the
samples were good there was one that I lit
[SPEAKER_02]: it up and I was like Like I don't know
which sample you were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not calling anybody out I'm not gonna
say what number but the Terps disagreed
[SPEAKER_02]: with you dude when they hit my tongue I
had to blow it out and then It was still
[SPEAKER_02]: burning in the one hitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just shot up this flaming ball of
weed out of the one hitter I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, dude, we're not even smoking match.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to stomp it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they can't all be winners,
but everything I tried was phenomenal I
[SPEAKER_01]: can admit that I did not try them all I
could not try them all I think I tried
[SPEAKER_02]: about 40 out of the 50 I definitely knew I
said number 30 I was like this one stands
[SPEAKER_02]: out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Trekay's herb stood out to me highs
herb stood out to me There's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: quality herb in that event.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about cup moments And the
whole thing I feel like this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was able to Connect better with the
people that sounds so weird to say it that
[SPEAKER_02]: way But the people that come to the booth
the iry army the customers the fans the
[SPEAKER_02]: new people the old people the friends the
returning friends The internet strangers
[SPEAKER_02]: that I just met in person I feel like at
this cup I was much more present more able
[SPEAKER_02]: to of course I was smoking and there was
some of that barrier sometimes but I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like I was more able to look people in the
eye and meet them and make an actual
[SPEAKER_02]: Connection with people at this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really cool the the length of the
event and the the size of the event
[SPEAKER_01]: population wise work really well together
a nice long VIP party Friday night and
[SPEAKER_01]: then a good cup Saturday was just enough
time for 350 people to group up how they

[SPEAKER_01]: hustle to do what you want to do There was
plenty of time to chill and chat and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think I felt like we had to rush

[SPEAKER_02]: their seeds.

[SPEAKER_02]: It was all good fun People that did not
win the cup whatever they were still happy
[SPEAKER_02]: with themselves They still had a good time
they entered and they were proud about it
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one dude who stopped by a couple
of times you actually gave him His first
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, and I saw you a little soldier
at the the pizza line waiting for his spot
[SPEAKER_01]: like four hours later Just glazed like a
Christmas ham ear to ear smile on his face
[SPEAKER_01]: But this dude entered a jar for the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't think it was that good But it
was some of the best that he'd put
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was excited that he entered He thought
it was kind of silly and I remember at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of it He was like six people voted for
me, bro Like I you know, can you believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's that's what it's all about
Like you don't have to win winning is
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing coming in second third fifth Like
you guys work so hard you put so much love
[SPEAKER_01]: into that herb and you can really really
taste it When people do that quality of a
[SPEAKER_01]: job with cannabis, but like this dude
placed almost I mean not dead last but
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the very last You know dregs of
the race but still He's he's among some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best herb in colorado, which is among
the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I remember exactly the guy
you're talking about I could see a smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a really wholesome smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a cool guy So I was like six votes
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That meant the world that was his first
time traveling for a weed event That was
[SPEAKER_02]: his first weed event his first time
entering uh, then bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: This made him super excited He took his
first dab with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave that kid his first dab and he was
wrecked I watched it hit him like I
[SPEAKER_02]: watched the first phase of the dab hit him
and he was like I got high And then he
[SPEAKER_02]: realized like 30 seconds later like i'm
fucking getting higher Like and then he
[SPEAKER_02]: was just smiling and he's like,
I don't even know what to say and I go bro
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to say anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be high and enjoy yourself,
but I can just see it It's just like I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have anything left to talk about I
was like, yeah, you just fucking erased
[SPEAKER_02]: your brain with the dab dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay And so he went and wandered
around and then you pointed him out He's
[SPEAKER_02]: like look at this guy over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy in the pizza line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, fuck Yeah, I got him so high
He's just over there just a fucking melted
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just there was a table with like
condiments And napkins and stuff and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was just at the end of it just like the
happiest little camper ever waiting his
[SPEAKER_02]: turn for Yeah, that's a great dude,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said I just said that I tried to
connect with everybody and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: remember your name I'm not sure that you
remembered your name that day brother,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we had a great time I want to give a
shout out to one of our new friends Justin
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin's been hanging out on the discord
But i'm super proud because Justin also
[SPEAKER_02]: made it out to his very first weed event
He allegedly came from texas and he
[SPEAKER_02]: allegedly also brought Some beautiful
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great to meet you Justin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the party, bro Thanks for
coming and hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about cup moments the entire
cup dude was Magical, I know that's so
[SPEAKER_02]: drew Barrymore of me, but it is so true It
had like I said in the morning is we're
[SPEAKER_02]: packing up There's a little bit of rain
and it was vendors just hustling to get
[SPEAKER_02]: ready But we're all in a good mood like
hustling to get ready Carrying a heavy box
[SPEAKER_02]: with one hand smoking a joint with the
other like that's hustling to get ready at
[SPEAKER_02]: the dude gross cup It wasn't stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had offer or people offering to help us
carry stuff to load in Before we had the
[SPEAKER_02]: trunk of the car popped You know who was
parked next to us offering to help us
[SPEAKER_02]: carry shit from the very beginning of the
event It was high the guy that won the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cup The dude gross cup the winner
of the cup was like, hey, can I help you
[SPEAKER_02]: carry stuff in before the event guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how cool it was like the winner the
champion the guy that had the best weed
[SPEAKER_02]: was trying to help us carry stuff in
People just wouldn't watch us carry shit
[SPEAKER_02]: if they saw stuff like give me part of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me part of that It was kind of cool
so it felt like a fish festival or some
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of like I got those like Yeah,
we do bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do it was such a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um is one of the one of the things I loved
is When we started setting up we realized
[SPEAKER_01]: that our organization and our prep might
have not been as organization is Organized
[SPEAKER_01]: and prepped as we might have liked so we
had to you know rearrange and reorganize
[SPEAKER_01]: and part of that If I was working a
different kind of event would have meant a
[SPEAKER_01]: security risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, just having that much product or
merchandise on a table at one time within
[SPEAKER_01]: arm's reach of 350 people Who are some
degree of intoxicated and it was not a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem the whole day Yeah, we just had
seeds of bins just open and I never saw a
[SPEAKER_02]: hand go near them Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah people aren't gonna do that there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that is man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just everybody Took care literally
I didn't see anybody having a bad time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nobody was bummed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to wait in a line Nobody was
bummed that you know people were rude or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was cheery Everybody was jamming
and having a good time and there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: little You know too much sublime in the
mix, you know, I was just gonna actually
[SPEAKER_02]: always is I was gonna compliment them that
the music wasn't so loud We couldn't talk
[SPEAKER_02]: there was sublime, but it sounded like
sublime that way over there and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect You had to sing along in your head
a little bit with the music Rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: shout over it, which is very nice if you
guys ever throw an event as a vendor as a
[SPEAKER_02]: host as a sponsor Whatever, um,
and you're responsible for the music
[SPEAKER_02]: remember I'm trying to sell shit over
there and I paid to come have a booth
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make me yell over the music like
we're already talking all day Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to get down but also the customers
would like to hear us the shoppers would
[SPEAKER_02]: like to hear us We're all paying money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's uh, let's turn it down just a little
bit I don't want to sound like old guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I also don't want to sound like a old
guy All right, Mike.

notes here.

[SPEAKER_02]: You want to add to this part of the
podcast who you just freestyle at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point if you got anything to say?

belle of the ball a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah I did skip over there is that it
was Friday night of the vib party We were
[SPEAKER_01]: there maybe 15 minutes before it was
