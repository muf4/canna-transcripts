[SPEAKER_02]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hanging out with Clint and Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody knows Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been here a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint has been here a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a non-smoker the first few times he
was on the show, but now Clint has
[SPEAKER_02]: converted to the dark side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint is now a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: For you guys that do not know Clint,
he is a comedian or an aspiring comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just a silly open miker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually been a host hosting the open
mic at a local bar called Phil's Radiator.
[SPEAKER_02]: When is that and how has it been going,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Tuesday about 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: and come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a place to try out new jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been getting mixed reviews as to
who's coming down and stuff, but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's starting to blow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always takes a little bit to get stuff
going in this town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is Phil's?
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil's is Pueblo, Colorado C Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Union.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Union and C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or D, whatever it is down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the spot with the nice outdoor patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys do comedy inside or outside
right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just they got a stage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What time do we need to get there to sign
up if we want to be on the stage?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to come be a comedian,
try to get down there by 9.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even then, I'm not going to hold you
against the coals if you're a little late.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you performed at Phil's yet,
Adam?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've not performed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went down there last week and just saw
the show and it's a cool place,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's got dreams of doing some standup
comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done a couple of shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I didn't make it,
but I've heard he's shocking is what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: told.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guess that's better than shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts with the same letters,
though, so they may have been being nice
[SPEAKER_02]: to you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard what your act is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to go into it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you said that on a show, that is
shocking, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's big balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys want to hear some guy with
big balls talk about funny shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: go see Adam the next time he gets his big
balls ready to perform somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got to go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I got to go do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phil's Radiator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil's Radiator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got all like monster truckish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome brag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam and I and another hot friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so pumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be the night that you guys are
listening to the show probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to go smoke cannabis with
Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be getting Doug with high.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not on the show, but we are going to
be doing actually getting high with Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to get Doug Benson fucking lit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are listening to this on
Monday, this will come out Monday the
[SPEAKER_02]: 15th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Benson is at ComedyWorks in Denver
tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last I checked, it was not sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Benson is well worth your drive to
Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a smoke session somewhere
and it'll be your chance to smoke with
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a good time if you show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite weed comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the most popular weed comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you listen to one of his podcasts
almost every weekend and then I watch the
[SPEAKER_01]: other one just about every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two different tastes, you know
what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're still right there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug Loves Movies is one of my favorite
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Doug Loves Movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess go listen to that one when the
show is over.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into movies and pop comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you only have a few minutes
for a podcast, Doug Loves Minis is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a perfect short little show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I listen to it when I take a shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does about 15 minute episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's long enough to hit play, jump in the
shower, clean your ass, get out and dry
[SPEAKER_02]: off and get dressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have about 15 minutes for a guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Doug, we've promoted you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need you to start promoting us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just went on for like a minute about
Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just pumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top of the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going to ComedyWorks quite a
bit and man, there is nothing like a good
[SPEAKER_02]: show at a good comedy club.
[SPEAKER_02]: ComedyWorks has it freaking correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bragged on the show about seeing Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint went the night before us and sat
front freaking road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: They let your hairy ass up there?
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't filming that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just let us up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they wouldn't have let my ugly
ass up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, when they were filming, they would
put decent looking people up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then a sexy young lady and a guy
showed up and they had no problem telling
[SPEAKER_02]: those people, sorry, you have to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would reseat you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this girl in like a tangerine or
melon colored shirt with giant boobs and a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of makeup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could tell she was going to go out
front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just walked right up to the front
row and put her in the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they had no problem making people
move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan Rainey and Matt Chapman were at the
show and they kind of got put up towards
[SPEAKER_02]: the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they slowly moved them back to
our section.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got moved five times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sat me down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to in line kind of early,
like maybe 30 minutes before.
[SPEAKER_03]: The doors were supposed to open.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were in line pretty early and
that's, they just let us in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the group ahead of us was like of
six dudes and there's only seven front row
[SPEAKER_03]: seats.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like they had already had most of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're like, all right, you guys go to
the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if that's like an
ideology of like, they're going to want to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk more because there's six of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm going to be talking louder.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only two, me and my buddy Riley,
we go up and we thought, oh, second row,
[SPEAKER_03]: that'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy goes, Hey, there's two more
front.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want front.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, yeah, I think I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's a cool place to be front
row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really hoping we get there good on
Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Rogan does a beard joke and it felt
like it was directed at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys get that joke too?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to ruin the joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not get a beard joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a grateful dead joke and I felt as
if he were staring me directly in my eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: telling this grateful dead joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't say that to anybody,
but on the ride home, the girl I took with
[SPEAKER_02]: me said, he looked you straight in the
face when he said, the grateful dead joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was talking about duck dynasty beards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he might've.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did mention duck dynasty.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mimed a part of his joke because I
really don't want to give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to be on comedy central here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to go to that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and I were in the taping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to be in the taping,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather not next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't go take a piss and I didn't
have to piss, but just telling me that I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't go take a piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have to piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're just like, oh,
I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, suddenly I need to pee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to be sitting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to pee the whole time he was on,
but I was like, I'm not leaving.
[SPEAKER_02]: No food or drink service during the entire
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came and took our beverages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the comedy works, they have a
menu hanging from the chair in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took the pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made everybody take off their hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was no logos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, they were moving ugly people
to the back of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was definitely intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back row.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sat me under a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the camera was right above my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I feel like a couple of the
jokes, Joe was looking me in his eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: telling them to me because it gave him
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The camera was above my head and it made
it feel, instead of talk to that machine,
[SPEAKER_02]: he could just talk to me and it felt a
little more natural because I was high and
[SPEAKER_02]: laughing my ass off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, and I was just laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it was a fun place, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just, yeah, we went for a walk
after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fun having, I had a lady friend
with me and I had Adam with me and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: fun because a dude walked up and
recognized me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, Hey man, are you that guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I am Rasta Jeff from IRE
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he ever get a hold of you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're listening out there,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil was his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's up, Phil?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't contacted me yet,
hit me up on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a direct message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking flyers with me to Denver
Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what you say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've only got a couple of few left.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may need to go to Kinko's and get some
printed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take five with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to give Tony Hinchcliffe a big
shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we talked about Tony
Hinchcliffe on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about the Joe Rogan show,
but Clint got to go too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony Hinchcliffe nailed it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one hell of a comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, but you could still see,
yes, he's been doing comedy for awhile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could see another step when you
watch Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say that Tony Hinchcliffe wasn't
great because that's, that's what I like
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like seeing guys that are better than me
because I can go, Oh, I'm not the big fish
[SPEAKER_03]: in the little pond.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little fish in a little pond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit being a like get better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what I get to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when we bring guys down and they've
been doing it for like five years,
[SPEAKER_03]: eight years, 10 years, you get to see
like, Oh, that's where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was, but seeing Tony Hinchcliffe
and I don't know how long he's been
[SPEAKER_03]: telling jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's 30, he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You listen to the Joe Rogan experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, that, but he also said it when
he was talking about being, did he do his
[SPEAKER_03]: a knit cap bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, I'm a 30 year old man in a
knit cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listened to him on Tony or on Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was, it was a magical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put my fucking shit in the
microphone to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but Tony Hinchcliffe was on par.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some really good jokes,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, not only that, but you say Joe
Rogan killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as a comic to be up there for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I, me and him talked about
it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was really nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see the nerves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought so too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then a lady heckled him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You told me about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as she heckled him,
he came out of the like nervous thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: went away and he's like, what bitch?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of went off on her for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he came back to the set,
he was on point from then on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that heckler kind of helped him
out, kind of helped him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it brought the crowd and him together
before, before that there was a barrier
[SPEAKER_02]: between the performer and the crowd
because it was called cameras.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tension in there affected our
laughter and his performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once that heckler, all of that,
we became one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Tony Hinchcliffe and you guys can
laugh your asses off if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Tony Hinchcliffe slightly remind you
of Ineya Lujan?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the look.
[SPEAKER_02]: The really mellow calmness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't shake him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nerves of steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of feels like he's, you know,
he's kind of always up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And slightly a hipster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't know what I, I looked at
him and I, I didn't think that he felt
[SPEAKER_03]: like, like he was having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just, like his sense of humor is so
like, yeah, it's kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it just, it wasn't, I wish he'd
have been having more fun while he was
[SPEAKER_03]: telling his jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did invite him back for a weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got to pay attention to when Tony
Hinchcliffe has come to ComedyWorks and go
[SPEAKER_02]: to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see, I'd love to see more than
how much, he probably did 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did about 15 when we saw him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I'll just talk to comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunday night I went to the Oddball Comedy
Fest, the Oddball Comedy Tour with
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardwick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he like headlining it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he was actually second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louis CK headlined.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were nine comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were, Brody Stevens was the
host and he said nine comedians and he
[SPEAKER_02]: must have been one of the performers that
he counted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I can't think of who the other,
the others were.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Brody Stevens, Whitney Cummings,
Chris Hardwick, Demetri Martin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannibal Buress, Sarah Silverman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to forget somebody cause I'm on
the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Marin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say Louis already?
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Louis CK who was before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan Rivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might've been Joan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That set was quite stale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to Google it because I feel bad
missing somebody on that list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that losing prices, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to get it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll read the whole list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Rocks seems like, I haven't been down
there yet, but it definitely, I saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: picture that you posted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aziz Ansari is who I'm forgetting.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you forget Aziz?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're so little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aziz was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody got 15 minutes,
but I think Louis may have gotten,
[SPEAKER_02]: it seemed like Louis did 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a comedy fan, we've gone on
for a minute, but you'll get this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single second of Louis' set was
calculated.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew where to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew where to take a couple of steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, and I'm not a comedian,
but I paid enough attention to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm friends with all you comedian guys and
I've paid enough attention to what you
[SPEAKER_02]: say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I get it now and I could feel every
minute of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He crushed it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always be crushing was Louis' motto that
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was killing it, dude on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to see him now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now just to see his mannerisms,
but you've performed, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's also performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You understand like, when the singer does
it in this note, it sounds a lot better
[SPEAKER_03]: than this note that's like one octave
higher or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being the drummer, my thing is to play
less.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I overplay as a drummer, then you sound
like you're insecure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you learn to get older and play less
notes, it's when you sound better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Louis has learned each note
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louis, and honestly, not to sound like an
asshole, he was one of the comedians I was
[SPEAKER_02]: not most excited to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't you seen him before?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've never seen Louis CK perform
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen any of those guys perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to see none of the world's best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aziz was good, really high energy,
stuck to the same joke basically the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: time, told like a story with a lot of
taglines and a lot of callbacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardwick, this affects my podcast hosting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I listen to Nerdist often.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch At Midnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've followed Hardwick since the freaking
Singled Out days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know he's from Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how he used to play in a band with
Furman called Hard and Firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he comes out at Red Rocks and he puts
his hands up in there and he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could see the 15 year old boy in him
that's wanted to do that since the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time he touched a guitar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that was his dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just clummed his pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of got to share that with my
friend, Chris Hardwick through podcasting
[SPEAKER_02]: and that relationship that I feel,
that stalker relationship that you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like you have with all the celebrities you
follow now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did feel like that with Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like this is my buddy performing
and I've known him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I wanted to, as he was walking
off the stage, I wanted to shake his hand
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was just also like, he's not a guy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a weird thing to have this
relationship with people that is a
[SPEAKER_03]: one-sided relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably do the same thing with
Hardwick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just be like... I felt pride for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my buddies just crushed it at Red
Rocks because he was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a great, great set.
[SPEAKER_02]: His set was man, he's kind of a pervert,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a joke and I don't want to blow his
bit, but half of his bit was about fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: your mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for Hardwick to go that route at Red
Rocks, it was funny for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dimitri Martin did his thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dimitri Martin, he surprised me how funny
he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: My date that I took with me, she loved
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's who she went to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to chuckle at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Trauma is a killer DJ, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that ran music between the
comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we took a 15-minute intermission.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about a 30-minute intermission.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe if you do comedy for too long,
you burn out your funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they gave a nice intermission.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stood up and danced for a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hannibal Buress was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did his thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a joke about Colorado having the
ugliest crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said, it looks like y'all came
from a hike.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he thought about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, you probably all just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he made a joke about who was the
white guy that broke down out here and
[SPEAKER_02]: decided, let's build a venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do shows here because Red Rocks is
kind of in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louis CK Crush, like I said, Mark Maron
was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: His closer was solid, but you could tell
he was frazzled and didn't know what to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maron's used to 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: To whittle Maron down to 15 minutes is
kind of like, you got to give him time to
[SPEAKER_02]: get out on the stage and sit down at the
edge of the stage and get pissed off about
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he gets into that Mark Maron
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't get time for that in his 15,
I didn't feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: His closer was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't blow anybody's bin on purpose,
but his closer was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Silverman surprised the shit out of
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her set was great, but she is funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is naturally funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whitney Cummings fucking yells her set at
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Whitney and my jokes are funny,
so you're going to laugh punchline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's what it feels like the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like you're being barraged with
jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was funny, but it was a bit fucking
too much for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just saying the way she delivered
them could have been better?
[SPEAKER_02]: She forgot she had a microphone and she
had to yell.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was Roman style.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt that way about her TV shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: When she's on TV, she doesn't feel like
she's speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: She feels like she's over projecting to me
too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Brody Stevens needs medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brody Stevens was the host.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brody, take your medicine, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you need to fucking calm down Brody
Stevens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking harness that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you smoke too much of that good
Colorado weed, but at that show you were
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking losing your fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of Brody Stevens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personal preference there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just like anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad that there's some people that
don't like my comedy, because if everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: liked it, it'd be like, wow, that's not
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's as fucked up as me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants another Dane Cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep telling my mom that she doesn't
want to hear it, but she doesn't fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mom's going to come see your comedy?
[SPEAKER_01]: She wants to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to tape it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to have the camera pointed
at you at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be her reaction the entire time.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I make sure that nobody's coming to
my shows, like family-wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know when I do stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would be terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they listen to the I Grow
Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesday night, it's nine o'clock,
Phil's radio, downtown Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free to get in, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's grounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're dumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of smoking weed, this is a
podcast about consuming cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing cannabis, and cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should probably talk a little bit about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a little ranty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially, I think our listeners enjoy
getting a little inside of our heads and a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of our world and knowing what's
up with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, that Chris Hardwick talk,
they're my friends now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're 29, 30 episodes into being my
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've spent 30 hours together now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're bros and sissies, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a lady out there, you're my
bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else to call you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're family.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening to the show just as
much as all the dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a female friend who is encouraging
me to do an episode all about women and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told her to research it for me and help
me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have any ideas for women and
cannabis, it feels sexist, a guy doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: show all about women and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything I come up with, I feel like
it'll be gender biased and it'll be weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ladies, send me some stuff so that I
can do a ladies podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to satisfy the listeners and if
you're asking for it, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we gots to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ranting again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Women and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the trimmers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Clint is a comedian, we should remind
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that one wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't even going to open my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to give a shout out to
Miss Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jessica, you're a badass grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stand up for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite female growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, do you not know any
kind of people from Denver that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: could travel down?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get people on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to do like an hour and
it's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do a report on it instead of
bringing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll talk to Jess and get some info
from her because she's a badass female
[SPEAKER_02]: grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: She grows as good, if not better,
than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give her that credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: She grew some kong that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow at Miss Green Thumb on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find out the proper, the exact
Instagram address and I'll tweet that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: out so you guys can follow her because
she's a great grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Clint came.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Clint here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint used to be a nonsmoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he is a new smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because he took two puffs off
of a bowl earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirt weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously did not come from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought it in myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt bad about it immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I saw him get plenty high off two good
puffs of some, some shwaggle weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really shwaggles, but it was not
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoked it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not, it's not rasta weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not iry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks similar to that stuff that was in
that bag over here the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on the smoke team now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he's joining us and now he's
got some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of his main, I wrote down the
questions because we got blazed and I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want to forget them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he knew, he looked into my eyes and he
goes, Clint's not going to remember
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the questions Clint had was
storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I, my little bag of weed is
my plastic fucking up my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hate to dis your weed that you got
now, but that's fine to keep in a sandwich
[SPEAKER_02]: baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you upgrade and you get some
quality weed from somebody that's a good
[SPEAKER_02]: caregiver that likes you and doesn't want
to see you smoking that shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your little to go portion in a baggie
maybe, but keep the rest of it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I store usually, you know, most people
have like a quarter to an ounce of weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe an eighth of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep it in a glass jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your glass jar size can depend on the size
of your stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use baby food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say Adam uses a baby
food jar to keep his weed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: 98 cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you go to Walmart trying to buy
a jar for number one, we live in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's no jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: For number two, they're $6 for a jar
that's the same size in the same price,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and you get baby food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Hey, I like peas and carrots,
carrots and peas, peas and carrots.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So butchered weed in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully when you get it, it's not too
dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not too wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's at the right point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If when I dry and cure my own weed guys,
you keep asking for a drying and curing
[SPEAKER_02]: episode that's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse and I are putting that together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting a lot of thought and work
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be episode 30 is the drying
and curing episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got about a week until that's out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_03]: God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening and being patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are listening to this next week,
I got a big show coming up September 22nd
[SPEAKER_03]: at Phil's Radiator.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're bringing Ron Babcock through and
he's a professional comedian who's been on
[SPEAKER_03]: TV before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's been on HBO.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been on Comedy Central.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he do weed jokes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's from LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's coming from LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to hit Phil's Radiator Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only $5.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the 22nd.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going to do as long as he wants
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do maybe 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul's going to do 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul Rosales is really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Paul?
[SPEAKER_03]: Garrett Waller is going to be on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Garrett Waller, what's up you giant
fucker?
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge, huge jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might do a fat guy joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might not.
[SPEAKER_03]: He will.
He will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then John Bueno is on that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, John Bueno.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope he wears a fancy sweater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably will.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was rocking Mr. Rogers last week,
wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just derailed to plug without asking at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught you doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the natural flow of this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we expect out of Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just ruin the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we expect out of Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where we are because I took notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we let you get nice and high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to ruin anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the captain of this ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start something called the,
what, what, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start something called the
cuss jar here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I say, after starting on
episode 30, every time I say the word
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck, I will donate a dollar to a charity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a conversation with the guy on
Instagram today and he asked me to donate
[SPEAKER_02]: to a charity and I will find out the
charity that he was asking about and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: donate a dollar starting on episode 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I say fuck in a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about each episode, however many times
you say fuck, you have to donate to a
[SPEAKER_01]: different charity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you're spreading it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully I don't say fuck more than
like six or seven times before it starts
[SPEAKER_02]: to hurt my feelings because after I start,
I'm going to throw down the dollars on the
[SPEAKER_02]: table and watch them happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to get expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last one you only had two, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully I can get to zero and
hopefully this guy's charity doesn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: anything out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't care what your charity is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a good conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a new friend today on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started off mad at me by something that
I posted and I turned him right around
[SPEAKER_02]: once I explained what I meant and made a
friend with the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out Dr. Green thumbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, there are so many Dr. Green
thumbs on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's a shout out to Instagram,
but that dude, I'm going to donate to his
[SPEAKER_02]: charity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I say fuck on episode 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime after this episode,
the F word cost me a dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start to, once I keep screwing up,
I will increase my value for the F word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and we're also not going to keep
track.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to tell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, people tweet me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, no, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just we're not going to keep track.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dreadful J has been tweeting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else has tweeted me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they remind me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a compilation of you saying fuck over
and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've just said fuck like 14 times in
the past five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, me and Clint are allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember putting up any money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll make that a guest stipulation
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll all start matching dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time somebody says it, then we all
got to match it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I'm below poverty level,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that I would just be doing it
just to be a dick too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint works at a steel mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck is in his daily vocabulary and
Adam is from the South and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he knows like six words and two of them
are fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're saying baby food containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baby food.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I literally got tired of going to
Walmart and there being none.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after you drive to both Walmarts
on either side of town and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: do I really want to go out to West?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, 98 cents, you know, you scoop it
out, you clean it out, let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, it's good in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's perfect for an eighth,
you know, especially like a fluffy eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to wait until, you got to make
sure your weeds dry enough to go into a
[SPEAKER_02]: jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was about to say- That's where I
derailed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm on it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting good at this podcast thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When my weed, when I'm curing and drying
my weed, I'll leave it a little bit extra
[SPEAKER_02]: moist for my personal so that I almost
have to open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do smoke flowers still.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't believe that I still smoke
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always dabs, but I'll leave my
weed a little moist where I got to open
[SPEAKER_02]: the jar and take the buds out and set them
down for 10 or 20 minutes before I can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually roll a joint with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a production crop for my patients,
I'm a caregiver and the herb that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get delivered to a guy later on
tonight, that stuff's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been cured and it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ready to go into his jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll keep, he's getting a half,
so it's probably going to go in a mason
[SPEAKER_02]: jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be sealed up and he'll just,
he'll probably pull out a little baby food
[SPEAKER_02]: jar worth for himself every couple of days
when he needs it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he hides the mason jar away from the
family and has that in a safe place and
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps his jar in his pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will also, if your weed is really
dry, that may bring back some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture in the Christmas too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your weed's really dry, I see a lot of
people trying to put fruit and shit in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to bring pathogens and molds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take a lot of moisture to start
molding up a jar if you leave it in there
[SPEAKER_02]: long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: This company does not pay me shit,
but I do highly recommend a Boveda or a
[SPEAKER_02]: Boveda Humidipack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your weed's a little bit too dry or a
little too moist, even you put the proper
[SPEAKER_02]: Boveda Humidipack in with your herbs and
it will properly moisten your herb to the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture content that is desired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it like 67 or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go to the Boveda website right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it around YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the humidity, the perfect humidity
should be around 67 or 76.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere in between there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the same thing as a humidor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also, yeah, well,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are humidor's for marijuana
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to mention the name because
I don't want to give them a plug either,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're shiny metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a locking seal to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in all shapes and sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if you're the high roller,
the pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people use them to transport
cannabis for the cannabis cups and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll basically have four or five of the
big pound storage ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three of them in a backpack and
they're loading, getting on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one ever knows because it's completely
sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still scary as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has your package, your humidifier
package that he's talking about that keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: it all at the same humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really tell you what it keeps
it at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says that it keeps it within a certain
range of ambient humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have so many products on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know they had so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys go check out the Boveda
website, Boveda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Coral Reefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's actually the one that introduced me
to the Boveda products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You a big fan of the Coral Reefer over
there, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to keep your weed
longer than, if you've got some herb that
[SPEAKER_02]: is dried and cured and you know it's not
moist enough, somebody hates the word
[SPEAKER_02]: moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people hate the word moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know your weed- Why would they hate
the word moist?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your weed's not too damp and you're
not afraid to get mold in it, you can put
[SPEAKER_02]: your herb in a vacuum sealer bag and
vacuum seal that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vacuum sealers aren't too expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bags aren't too expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seal it up, label it, mark it.
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Short says to put it in the freezer at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what my dad always did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd put it in a brown paper bag and then
stick it, put it in a bag, put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: brown paper bag and stick it in the
freezer because that way none of the light
[SPEAKER_01]: would get in through the brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your jars and stuff in a dark place
when you're not smoking them if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: the opportunity or if you can get an
opaque jar to keep the lights out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A large quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an eighth or a quarter,
you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got an ounce or quarter pound,
keep that out of the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that in the dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel really good about that question
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That took a lot longer than I was thinking
it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about in jars, if you keep stuff in
jars for longer than I do, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: so would you go in there once a month and
kind of dump it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I feel like we're going to do a whole
episode about drying and curing,
[SPEAKER_02]: once that process has ended, once drying
and curing is done, you can put it in your
[SPEAKER_02]: jars and just leave it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost better to leave it because
every time you open it, you're introducing
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen and you're changing the gases that
are in the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are actually releasing ammonias
and chlorophylls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't studied for this part so I'm
going to say wrong shit and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people are going to correct me,
but they're releasing gases inside of
[SPEAKER_02]: there and you're exchanging those gases.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you quit introducing more gases,
the decarboxylation and the changes will
[SPEAKER_02]: stop happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starches will quit becoming sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything will stay right where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like opening a food product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just gets stale eventually because
change, same thing will pretty much happen
[SPEAKER_02]: with your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about this on the show before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like mine a little bit drier because I
put mine through a grinder and still get
[SPEAKER_01]: the keef off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it when I bring it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sit it in the jar and just leave the
lid half on, half off for 12 hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: then put the lid back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still moist inside the bud a little
bit, but that outer stuff is flakier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it a little more sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a little more flavor out of it
when it's a little stickier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't let it dry out so much and then
your joint burns a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, iGrow Culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a question answered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint came over and asked a great freaking
question after he got high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also asked, since he's a new smoker,
he asked, so I hope we wrap that up,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to store your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baggies are cool, but the baggie has
static electricity and it's stealing all
[SPEAKER_02]: your shit and all your shit's sticking to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep it in a jar, a nug jug of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to be sneaky, they sell
skunk-proof bags that are smell-proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also, at iGrow Pueblo, they offer a
duffel bag-style bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a backpack that they claim is
smell-proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not tested it by putting any
products in it, but they claim such and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're decently priced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they work, that's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also stash cans and things like
that that you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you've seen them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's hiding.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more being secretive here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really looking to keep it secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you already got it like a little
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his next question was a normal new guy
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How am I going to pass my pee test?
[SPEAKER_03]: Working sucks, right, everybody?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working for the man does suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, you're with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies, you listening?
[SPEAKER_03]: Working sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys want to tweet all that stuff
at AtTallClint and not at iGrowCulture,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send your comments to AtTallClint,
ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I meant watch us work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, work sucks, but I like my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, my job does not like people
that smoke marijuana, and it sucks because
[SPEAKER_03]: I like my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I could quit, I would.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just life's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got three women asking me for money all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got a family.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just cracking up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you want somebody to come crash
your podcast, invite a comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just destroy this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we need to loosen up and have more
fun on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been real tight reading news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today on the news, there was weed stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that we got somebody here to
just... What's that character's name?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but he was good and he needs
to stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you worried about them popping random
drug tests or are you worried about
[SPEAKER_01]: getting hurt and them wanting you to pee
in a cup for workers when they come?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two times that I can get
UA's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, randoms are... I don't know
that anybody that's got...
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from a weed smoker that's dealt
with this time and time again,
[SPEAKER_01]: randoms, it's just the dice that you're
rolling, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the iRegenetics only surefire way
that I think I know how to get past a drug
[SPEAKER_02]: test that has worked for me multiple times
when I was a heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went 63 days without smoking
cannabis at one point and took a pee test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to get a bad ass job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was promised a killer job.
[SPEAKER_02]: 63 days and could not pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was still hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was drinking cranberry juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was killing the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My family was mad at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, honestly, I went to reggae
on the rocks and didn't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I quit from the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: I puffed down and then for 90 days after
that, or 63 days after that, I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke and still could not get this job
that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told them, I was like, I haven't
smoked in 65, 63 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, sorry, you still didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, can you give me 30 more days?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were already hiring for the
position.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so the next time I needed to take a
pee test, I could not risk my pee even
[SPEAKER_02]: going in the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your best bet is to use fake piss
because they are not checking for fake
[SPEAKER_02]: piss or piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for THC, crystal meth,
opiates, ecstasy, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our case, hopefully, guys, if you're
listening to my show, hopefully the only
[SPEAKER_02]: thing they're going to find in your pee is
some fucking medicine, some cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's not my spot to judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they sell a product that is straight up
fake piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is designed to be fake piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually at some kind of a head shop
around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of spots you can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys all know where they are if you
live around here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't endorse either one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to work out a sponsorship if they
want me to say their names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start paying us Mr. Money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go there and you get this fake pee
and it's got a thermometer on the side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottle has a thermometer on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should come with a, it's a glove warmer
for the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You crack the thing open and you put your
glove, you put it in your gloves and it
[SPEAKER_02]: warms your hands in the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes with one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't, you got to go buy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do, this is how I sure fire past
more than one drug test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get this product and I microwaved it for
seven seconds in my microwave and that
[SPEAKER_02]: made it a little too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took a sock and I cut the sock off
and I stapled it to the inside of my
[SPEAKER_02]: boxers to where it looked like it was my
dick swinging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put that a warmed up bottle of
microwaved fake piss in the sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I could tell that it was going to be
warm enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went too long in the microwave.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing got down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need it between 96 and a hundred
degrees where you need it to get that your
[SPEAKER_02]: body is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me intervene here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use the heater in the car and a
plastic bag in my boxer line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not probation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one should be watching you piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be taking you to a lab and you
should be going into a closed area where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can pull out your dick and go,
woo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they wash your hands and check your
pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I'm saying in the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got this swinging, swinging sock with
a fake pee in it that's been microwaved
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've let it cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've driven around long enough to let
it get to the right temperature because
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got so much time to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, uh, if you're, you're a union
worker, I would assume they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: send you to a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a couple of minutes to go drive by
the house or seven 11 even, and hit the,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a piss and run into seven 11 and use
their microwave or a crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to, if you're working a
job where you might get p-tested,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need this shit in your locker or in
your truck or somewhere close.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can carry this fake piss in your
cigarette pack, you're a fucking genius.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little tiny bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got fake piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get hit with this pee test,
you go, you're driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they take another car to drive you
to the gas station.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say, I got a pee man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can we stop and get a pack of
cigarettes, go in there and hit that
[SPEAKER_02]: microwave for seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do whatever you got to do to warm that
piss up to the proper temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got that glove cracker,
use that, wrap it around it, put a rubber
[SPEAKER_02]: band around it, put it between your legs
and squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you feel your legs getting too warm,
that shit's probably right at the right
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and you got that little bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tucked inside of a sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strapped inside your boxers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girls, you're going to have to modify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to look like you got a dick
if you follow my method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wear a skirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pull out this little bottle and just
stick it out of the pee hole you're
[SPEAKER_02]: flying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick your hand in there and stick your
thumb out so it's like your dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they're standing behind you or
something, you're going to have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick your thumb out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make that look like your dong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always fart during a pee test if someone's
watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just mandatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I squeezed the bottle the first time I
did it into the little sample cup and it
[SPEAKER_02]: went...
[SPEAKER_02]: when I let go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I let go of it because it tried to suck in
more air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tip it up so that you don't make a bong
sound when you're fucking doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or fart right at that point if you can
time it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then stick that thing, close it back
up, screw the cap on, stick it back in
[SPEAKER_02]: your underwear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave the cup there like you're supposed
to and hope that you just put enough of
[SPEAKER_02]: the right temperature fake piss in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that fake piss worked for me more than
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fake piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't trust my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had his girlfriend pee in the cup and
that's how they found out that my buddy
[SPEAKER_02]: was pregnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely don't use female's piss but
I've never used my own piss.
Ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to ask any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not trying to mask it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of things you can drink,
eat or whatever to take and all they've
[SPEAKER_02]: done is upset my stomach and give me
diarrhea and by the time you get to the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab you've got to pee so bad that your pee
is clear and they go, oh this is diluted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't even test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it comes through you and if you
smoke like Adam and I do, I dab at least a
[SPEAKER_02]: half a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could honestly probably quit for 15
days and you would maybe be fine but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: technically 30 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is I don't want to quit smoking
weed though and it's just a random that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wanted to quit I wouldn't have
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you should definitely get prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's one of the best options that
I've heard and then I would just keep hand
[SPEAKER_01]: warmers on the ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd start wearing shirts with pockets and
like, don't touch me.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day you're standing there talking to
your boss and there's this big,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you lactating Clint?
[SPEAKER_03]: My pocket protector is not working today.
[SPEAKER_03]: My nipple peed all over me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be a joke there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's definitely a joke there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I don't take your jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take my jokes because I wouldn't
tell it anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm not going to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone 40 minutes, 41 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to do one more question or
you just want to- I was going to say is
[SPEAKER_02]: there one more question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one more but I bet we could go on
for quite a while about it if we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll kind of make it a long question.
Now you've got me in suspense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what it's about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the question was, what kind of
lights are you using for each phase of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be really long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it could be really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quick rundown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I started off doing a bunch of grow
lessons and we got sidetracked because
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse came over and started doing outdoor
grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started talking about all kinds of
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of lost track of the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise to get you caught up on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much shit going on that
it's hard to even catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a busy season.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a great year to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been so much cannabis news and
stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a busy season.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse will be here in a couple of days and
we're going to work on finishing up the
[SPEAKER_02]: drying and curing episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll definitely be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what kind of lights do I use?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: For seedlings and stuff that's just
starting, simple T5s are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of guys... You mean fluorescents,
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluorescents.
[SPEAKER_02]: T5 fluorescents.
[SPEAKER_02]: T5s are the little skinny bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they name them T5s are the skinny ones
and T8s are the bigger ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what size they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I keep my seedlings and my clones under
T5s until they're good and rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on which room they're going and
what I'm trying to do with them,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes they'll stay under T5s until
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm just doing a three gallon pot of a
little plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why you run T5s is not only
because of the heat, but because you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get them closer to the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put them right on the plant and
they're more energy efficient than a big
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that the plant really
needs a thousand watt light when it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just give it enough just to end
that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell two different color bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get the blue ones, those keep your
plant short and squat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we want for veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until your plants are two and a half,
three feet tall, that's plenty of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't keep them too crowded in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them plenty of space with the T5s.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's definitely helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people flower with T5s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in Tennessee where you're
not supposed to be growing weed and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't get a big light built, that's going
to be better than buying weed off of some
[SPEAKER_01]: dude on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen some people grow some pretty
dank stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to start, I like the T5s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they get a little bit larger,
I will throw them under.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go straight to the thousand watt metal
halide for vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a nice veg room with thousand
watt metal halides in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them kind of close to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hortilux, I think it's the blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget which one they make.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Hortilux lights they make for
vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome for vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hortilux makes a high pressure sodium that
is red.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super awesome for flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to switch to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you step from the T5s to the
bigger lights, just give us a range on how
[SPEAKER_01]: far you want to keep them.
[SPEAKER_02]: As close as you can get them within,
you kind of want to get them as close as
[SPEAKER_02]: you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: As close as you can without burning the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a range around a thousand
watt light bulb that is unusable light for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too intense and it's the wrong
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to back up about a foot and a
half, two feet from the bulb is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: your best bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But only the tops of your plants are up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bottoms of your plants,
there's a lot of factors to keep in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But about a foot, 18 inches to a foot is
probably about as close as you really want
[SPEAKER_02]: to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you've got some amazing cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got really well ducted and
ventilated lights, then you can get them
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes that burst of light coming
right out of there isn't what the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: really want.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will kind of stress the plants and
change the flavors and kind of do a few
[SPEAKER_02]: things that if you want a certain effect,
that's how I achieve one effect when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is light stress the plant a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to tell too much about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm vegging under the T5s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm moving to the metal halides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go to high pressure sodiums to
finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago, I tried an experiment
using high pressure sodiums and metal
[SPEAKER_02]: halides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly get the best flavors using
a mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different spectrums?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got four high pressure sodiums with a
one metal halide right in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the plants in the middle of the
room were a little more dense,
[SPEAKER_02]: had a little more flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned that by running the old
reflector called the Grozilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: It holds two bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a 600 sodium and a 400 halide in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything in that little tester hut
came out dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the pictures of headband on my
Facebook are actually from that hut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've seen those pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is headband yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to plug your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, nice try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I got to talk to Dr. Dank today
or Mr. Dank today, the creator of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little conversation on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of nice because I did not
create Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people try to give me credit for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Dank created Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I simply put it into seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reversed a female, made a male out of it
and put the pollen on another female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a dank cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made seeds out of the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys want to give credit to the guy
that made it, thank Mr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mr. Dank, for letting me use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually gave me permission to put it
into seed and he said all he wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought everybody deserved good
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of why I started making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I usually do fluorescence halide
sodiums.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people will ask about LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to knock an LED light, but my
friend Nancy kills it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that bounty killer?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's running Capelton too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both look frosty and dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much all of her stuff is on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just about to say she's running a
lot of stuff that's from other growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: not even me, that looks amazing just as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the one that she's got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it DB Cooper?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just giant nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nancy's doing a great job with the grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Nancy Goodwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about women growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always get her to write something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make a note of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's probably a well-spoken individual
that could probably put a paragraph in
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Support those women growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what Clint says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I was just making a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have an approach as a
comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time Clint told me, go on the
chauvinist route, and I believed him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little misogynistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no denying that you were good at
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really easy and that's why I don't
like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's easy to write those jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an easy target.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying women are easy targets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm staring into my computer like,
how do I fix this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took it this direction almost on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let Clint do some plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint has a lot of shit to plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about your Facebooks, your
Instagram, your shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we call you to cuss you out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do we email you to send you hate
mail?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, best way to get a hold of me is
probably Facebook or Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at tall Clint and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing a lot of shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably have about one showcase a
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's a little rough because it's on
a Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just passing through and somehow we
booked him.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Ron Babcock.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a funny guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm free that Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: For five bucks, come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: A professional comedian coming to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not unheard of, but you guys are
going to miss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want anybody to miss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even hear about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard one of my favorite bands,
Baroness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever heard?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like a metal band.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite bands and my buddy Paul
who does comedy with me told me,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, we had them back in 2000 come
through and play some house show.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like a huge band in metal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you miss it though is because
you don't know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not enough to do in Pueblo to
where you guys can be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, that's fine during the
fair, but you don't have anything to do
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something going on down there
every day, it seems like though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to distinguish what's good and
what's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm inviting you to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: For five bucks, you can come and watch a
professional comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch me be a fucking piece of
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Paul and John are there too and
they're funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got two out of four at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a good show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have faith in you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk a lot of trash about you open
micro comedians, but you guys are getting
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been at it for quite a while and
you're getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are funny now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've only been doing it for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The comedy scene here has definitely
blossomed and evolved in quite a nice way.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one opening, so that's
pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comedy heals the world guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comedy and cannabis, they go well
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's a good way to end this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap up this portion of the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, you got anything to plug?
[SPEAKER_02]: Overgrowthegov.com on Twitter,
420th.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam will be here when I do the intro and
exits to the show, so he'll get to say a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more cool stuff for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint, dude, thanks for taking a little
bit of time out of your night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get to work pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kept you for longer than we should
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing well, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
