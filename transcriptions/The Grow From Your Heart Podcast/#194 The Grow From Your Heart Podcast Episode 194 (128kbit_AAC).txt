[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band for letting me use this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a super
special announcement to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends in the Mystic Roots Band,
Kat and Coot, had a beautiful baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That baby is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a future rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to see the style that kid
has, because those are some cool ass
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganja star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganja star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, across the table
from me on the microphone is our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still doing your podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on hiatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on hiatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, go listen to old
episodes of the Call of Rod Dope podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: featuring our friend Jesse Grosz and also
44 and Despicable D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear there's a dude named Fetus that
joins us sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on one or two shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a cousin Tater over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cousin Tater was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't see Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would have seen him.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, cousin Tater?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard he left.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but he's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a traveling salesman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cousin Tater, I made you a promise and I
will still honor that promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I would do something and I
promised you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't forget, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still owe you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found the article you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: The attachment I've been looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you were doing the whole opening
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was searching for it through
emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using your time wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Cat and Coot and their
new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know what they named the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to talk about the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give the kids some privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one more announcement before we get
into the email that Jesse just dug up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, Mike was talking
about going to Mexico on the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jacket, the shoes all made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Davey's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent a good amount of time in a
place in Mexico about 150 miles from where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the best nine months of my
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was two different sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some of the best times of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was when I was in my very early 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where you didn't give a shit that there
were cartels down the street that may
[SPEAKER_00]: remove your head if you walked down the
wrong street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even saw them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't exist, at least where I was at.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was 16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody says that this town is
shitty, but I don't see it because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: go to where that shit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not involved in that, so I don't see
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got its spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting coffee at the 7-Eleven on
East 4th Street the other day and saw a
[SPEAKER_02]: dude shooting up right on the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually the first time in my
life I've ever seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have been taking care of his
diabetes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there were three other guys standing
around him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they all used the same needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, Pueblo, get it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sloppy diabetics, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are on drugs, if you're using
drugs and you need some help, just hit one
[SPEAKER_00]: of us up because we want to have you not
do drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heroin's bad, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack is whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your shit together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kill your local heroin dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do stupid drugs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meth is dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heroin's stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack is whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushrooms are all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not your parents, but I think
mushrooms are cool and I feel like a blast
[SPEAKER_00]: of DMT every once in a while is all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never tried it, but acid's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your acid is good for your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling somebody today that I feel
like acid is therapeutic and it's good for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love some shrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on cannabis so that we
don't sway too far from our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have covered all of the main notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do sort of an outdoor
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be part two of the
outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part 1.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because we're going to focus mostly
on amending native soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse seemed very excited to talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was near and dear to his heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fresh in his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do you want to get started in
talking about amending native soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's tell people how
they can stalk you on social media first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stalk him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for him on Jesse grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can put a face to this sexy
voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can figure out who I am on
Facebook, I might say what's up,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep that vague.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, the music quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The song ended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So native soils back in the last episode,
we were talking about different,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you should grow in a pot or if,
you know, a big smart pot, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever works best for your location.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're one of the people that falls
into the, let's go ahead and amend my
[SPEAKER_02]: local soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode is going to be very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, soil in America, soil on earth is
either Sandy or clay or Lomi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I understand Sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obvious clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like when it's muddy and clay and
moist here in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a, it varies where you're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if you're close to a river,
if you're up on a plateau, if you're on
[SPEAKER_02]: the side of a mountain, um, you can also
have what is called shallow soil and that
[SPEAKER_02]: really sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that you live on bedrock
basically, which is great for building a
[SPEAKER_02]: house, but shitty for growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me about the Lomi texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with that too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lomi is going to be really similar to what
bagged organic soil looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, think of, uh, like Fertilome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine mixing that like half and half
with some sand and then half and half with
[SPEAKER_02]: some root 707.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel that texture in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays cold for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some real fluffy, you know,
all right, earthy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good because you'll get a lot
of aeration and you won't get,
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't squish the roots and the airs can
get oxygen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or CO2, I guess it'll happen in the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, decomposition from below.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that most definitely will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, water in the earth, water carries the
oxygen, oxygen down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so either Sandy or Lomi, um,
or I mean clay Sandy or clay soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but the most people aren't going to
have a Lomi soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's either going to be Sandy or clay,
but the easy way to fix that is you add
[SPEAKER_02]: compost and you either add sand or clay,
depending on what it is, compost form
[SPEAKER_02]: castings and peat moss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can come up with this Lomi soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and that is what you want to
shoot for when you're growing pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a nice, a nice aeration,
a nice, uh, enough for the roots to grab
[SPEAKER_00]: onto.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not going to be too fluffy and a
dark black soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you're going to want to check the pH
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's the proper way to check the pH
once that soil is mixed just with one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those soil test kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like one of the ones where you
dissolve a little soil into it with some
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then you like open up a capsule
and drop the, the, the, uh, powder that's
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll change a color and show you
which side you're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you adjust soil pH if you find that
it's too high or too low?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never had to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know potash will take the soil pH up
if it's too acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's probably not going to be a
problem though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are going to want to bring the
soil pH down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't, you're going to want to use
something that is acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, where I'm working at, we've been using
Bokashi tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing a process where we add
apple cider vinegar at the initial stage
[SPEAKER_02]: of the fermentation and it creates a
product that is pretty fucking corrosive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's we, we got smells hashtag.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to steal that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's what we've been using
primarily at my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I have experienced with right
now to bring the pH of the soil down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, other things that can bring soil pH
down is neem, uh, neem mill, I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: brings it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a big easy thing that's readily
accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can bring the soil pH down those
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, any good thermal compost is going to
have an acidic base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just throw your compost in there and
just add more because you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: putting some in there anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, neem as far as like dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back on that part, uh, neem cake,
I believe is acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, kelp mill will bring soil pH down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oyster shell mill, uh, definitely brings
pH soil down, but that's only after it's
[SPEAKER_02]: broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, will some dolomite lime help me
balance out my pH?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's the go-to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I was skipping all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I didn't want to be too obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were, you know, I was trying
to be creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dolomite lime is, um, I avoid using it
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's not completely natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, speaking of natural, can we talk about
the natural product that you showed up
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is also a product that will bring
soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sandwich baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a normal size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandwich baggie that you'd probably put an
ounce of weed in.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ounce of weed baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bag weighs, I'm going to drop it on
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you heard that through the mics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bag of, it looks like really fine
sand, but it is so heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got to be six pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jesse's going to weigh it with his
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say three, four pounds.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe five pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how dense that is in that
package.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like I'm trying, now I'm
comparing it to a loaf of bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that weighs a pound of bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I never knew that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many loaves of bread is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a Walmart sack full of fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we doing Ezekiel bread or are we doing
that shitty wonder bread?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's what, you know,
regular sandwich bread weighs a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, that's a jug of milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a couple jugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two jugs of milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like 3.75 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a jug of milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, what is in this magical dust that
you have gifted us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I know you can't say too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say too much because it's
still in product development we're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but it is accessible to the public
and we'll, I'll give you links to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: guy that can, you can buy it from here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we say where it came from?
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from the four corners region of
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the wrong email.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm not trying to ask too many
questions, but I'm trying to keep you
[SPEAKER_00]: moving while you're searching,
but I don't want to get you in any
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that you have agreed to not
talk too much about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I signed an NDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's volcanic rock dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from a volcano somewhere here in
the Southwest United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can replace your oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can replace your, let's say you got a,
you're running no till.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're using like the standard kutsu
mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It replaces all of those minerals in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also replaces any need for Agasil or
for add any kind of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's got my silicates in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said Azomite also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Azomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could replace the dolomite lime if I'm
using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can it replace for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: In certain ways, it can replace crustacean
meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the cation exchange that
crustacean meal has obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then crustacean meal also really helps
add in soil breakdown in its own special
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while this product does that too,
it can reduce the amount of crustacean
[SPEAKER_02]: meal you have to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this have a product name yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this just highly nutritious,
minimal volcano dust?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling it volcanic rock ash at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like now that you say
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like volcanic rock ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been screened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also water soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dump that in a bucket of water and
use it to foliar feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet they're going to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't use it in hydroponics because
it will settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll clog up the system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some heavier aspects of it
that will drop out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only parts of it are water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using it for a month at my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means we've been using it in four
cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got plants that are five weeks in
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've been using it as foliar
spraying the veg and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let everybody on the show know how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other places that have used it have
reported to like 10, 15% more yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm easily looking...
[SPEAKER_02]: At the stage of development I can see now,
I see more yield.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: More yield is always better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're putting this powder in there,
all that weight, that weight of this bag
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to translate to the weight in
your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much every heavy metal mineral you
need right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about... I distracted us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple of dabs of cactus cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of made my head spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about amending native soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about how to adjust the
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You taught me a whole bunch of stuff that
I never knew about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got sandy or clay soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added pee and compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked about adjusting the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the next step?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go back to pH real quick.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never worried about pH in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just of the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You pH your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the pH of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since I've gone no-to, I don't worry
about pH of... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still pretty much don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just make sure it's acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do want to avoid feeding anything
into your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned this through... I mean,
I've grown like 15,000 plants in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've learned a thing or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never feed your plants anything that is
basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always figure out... There's always some
organic way or conventional way to make
[SPEAKER_02]: your solution acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just always make sure it's acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same with your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time when you're buying a
pre-bagged soil from a store and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: only using it once or twice, you don't
have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no need to test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the reasons it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why that company is able to
have repeat customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when you start using soil over and
over and over again, is that the...
[SPEAKER_02]: The acidity starts to disappear and it
gets more basic and the pH rises and you
[SPEAKER_02]: start to run into all kinds of fucked up
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diminished yields, slow growth,
macro deficiencies really easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less resistance to pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less resistance to everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're... And this is important if
you're setting up a native soil because
[SPEAKER_02]: say you're here in Colorado, all of our
soil here on the ground is really fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially like the San Luis Valley,
anywhere in the front range.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get up into the mountains,
you may find forest humus based soils
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's going to naturally be more
acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the front range area, it's going to
be alkaline as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're setting up a long-term
soil, you need to check it every year and
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure you're staying at least below
6.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.2, 6.5 is kind of... That's what we've
been shooting for at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they say to go for for
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what works for tomatoes and hops
really works for cannabis for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking hops actually kind of like
alkaline soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing some research into growing
some other cash crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to grow some hops for cores?
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard an acre of hops grown the right
way is worth like $40,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no licensing, no regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal money is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a farm boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research, research, research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in like 10 years, is there going to be
the... There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jesse Beer Company?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck all that.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are so many beer companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll grow the shit for them though.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just get some kickback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay me in beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, pay me in cash.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cash is king.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay me in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will buy all the other things I need
with it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure your soil is down in the
acidity range.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited because I've been
growing in ground in the same six holes
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long fucking time and I've never
checked the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shit might get retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to go check it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's early still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say it's March,
but it's about to be April.
[SPEAKER_02]: Changing your acidity and your natural
soil does not happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeff just brought up a very good
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be checking the shit right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the time to do it because the
things you use to bring down the soil pH
[SPEAKER_02]: are...
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to dissolve and break down to
actually...
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they're changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to get in there and work and
mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to become bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't be alarmed after you do a bunch
of stuff and then you recheck your soil
[SPEAKER_02]: pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be alarmed if you check it and
nothing's changed yet, or if it's only
[SPEAKER_02]: went down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big secret on growing with
native soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bokashi pulp is another great way to bring
down soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stink juice that comes out of the
Bokashi bucket?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that's... Oh, the pulp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the pulp part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it breaks down... If it's wet enough
and you're treating it right, it'll break
[SPEAKER_02]: down in just a couple of weeks and turn
into black compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't emptied that Bokashi bucket
completely in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever is at the very bottom has been
in there for a year and it never fills up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It eats itself so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that once for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I finally did open it,
it was already black compost at the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking... And it just keeps
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put more scraps in there,
it never gets full.
[SPEAKER_00]: That black compost can eat... It'll eat a
whole banana in three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll destroy that banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the juice that comes out smells like
the bar trash can that somebody threw up
[SPEAKER_00]: in and buried and dug up and ate and
re-vomited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stinks so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, plants fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I use that in the mix, they stand
straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had always fed it to my plants at one
mil per gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a heavy dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can totally take... I wouldn't do it
repeatedly, but they can take up to an
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce per gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't foliar spray it more than five mils
per gallon though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I would foliar spray it
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things that I would
be afraid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my situation, which is primarily
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super high ventilation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what I'm thinking about too,
the same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, that may not be good,
but in a greenhouse environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it because you're going to have
enough airflow, enough nature to make
[SPEAKER_00]: things all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, you may cause yourself some
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an amazing bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi has never paid me, but Bokashi and
the stuff that goes in the Bokashi bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: and that process, that is an amazing
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a way you can make it at home
without having to pay 35 bucks for the
[SPEAKER_02]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get two five gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You drill a whole bunch of holes in one of
them and you go to Lowe's and get just...
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs like three and a half bucks and
it looks pretty much just like... Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the little spigot?
[SPEAKER_02]: The little spigot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you... And you don't even actually have
to put the spigot on there, but this is if
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to collect the juice,
the chile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put that in the bucket that you don't
drill the holes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got one bucket with the little
spout on it and then you have another
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket with holes in it and you put the
whole bucket into the bucket with the
[SPEAKER_00]: spout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your shit in there and cover it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get you an airtight paint lid
that you can also get at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bokashi bucket for like 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buckets are like $4 a piece and that
spout's three and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take you a few minutes to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal it real well because if that stuff
leaks out, oh my God, it's the worst
[SPEAKER_02]: smelling stuff ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll want to run some...
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some silicone because there'll never
be any reason to take them apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's together, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at least some duct tape or some shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're in a part of the world
where you can't get bokashi grain,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is also super easy to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look it up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you teach us how to do that or is
that something we got to YouTube?
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to plan it, but yeah,
I can totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one of the next episodes, let's do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only done like half the steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never completely taken it to the
grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't added any bokashi to that bucket
in nine months, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still just doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually use the serum that comes
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's call it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's leachate is what Sean was
calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were both close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The serum that comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually use that as a mother
culture to keep it all going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like a sourdough bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I poured it back in and like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't done this, but I'm like 90%
sure it'll work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take that serum out, you dilute it
one part to one part with molasses,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you soak, say like some wheat
bran, some par cooked wheat bran,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you let it, let it soak for like a
week and then lay it out and let it air
[SPEAKER_02]: dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty fucking sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got bokashi grain at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fermented rice holes or fermented
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could use rice holes, any kind of par
boiled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure you want to take the
starch off, but don't quote me on that
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But par boiling it will take the starch
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be on the top, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll float.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of farm boy tricks coming into the
wheat growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait for it to go back to being a
farm product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's really, we're on the,
what a weird realm right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a department of ag training and
they're showing us all this greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, we're so close to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we'll get, I feel we'll go back to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're indoors right now and all that,
but we're going to head, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: an outdoor prop soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the demand, as more States come online
and the demand goes down, the price goes
[SPEAKER_02]: down, you're going to have to reduce the
price of production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means growing it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in green houses, sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's every one of those Gavitas costs
about a hundred dollars a day to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on a 12, 12 cycle, it's about a
hundred dollars a day to run a Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most facilities have a minimum of a
hundred lights in a flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most in Colorado, you're looking at 400
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seriously seen $25,000 electric
bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not uncommon in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled the, the electric bill,
the black Hills bill comes in in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mailbox at the grow and I pull it out and
it is thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like a notepad thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, how many folds did they fold
on this thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how many trees and that's just the
electric bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water bill has got to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this, you guys in a commercial
grow, if you're watering pots or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running hydro, all of that water that you
use, when it's done running through your
[SPEAKER_00]: pots or through your hydro system,
it is now considered hazardous waste and
[SPEAKER_00]: it cannot go down your municipal water
supply drains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be accounted for and handled as
hazardous waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water is now contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either filter it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can filter it yourself and try to
reuse it, or you have to deal with it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly in a legal way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's approved by the department of
agriculture, the department of health,
[SPEAKER_00]: the MED.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about all those expenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy that owns a mechanic shop here in
town that listens to the show every now
[SPEAKER_02]: and then is laughing his ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's had to get rid of oil and
transmission fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, ah, welcome to the real world
fuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about when you water a plant,
all that water that runs out of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the drain off every ounce of that has to
be accounted for and has to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we're not just throwing that
down the drain because that goes back into
[SPEAKER_00]: what Jesse and I drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My work at water's a comfy field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're, I'm in an indoor building and
it's a big square and it's, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got way off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using the Bokashi juice to make our
own Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living or they're just the castings?
[SPEAKER_02]: Both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red wigglers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually, in most places,
I would recommend worms are more important
[SPEAKER_02]: than castings are.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you have a good compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you're in Colorado, California,
Washington, Oregon, you know, one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: places, you get both.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but yeah, worms are more important
than anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you have, this Lomi soil pH
balanced at this point, then you can add
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it's not even completely
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as nutrients, you know,
I mean like alfalfa, kelp mill,
[SPEAKER_02]: comfrey,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, the crustacean mill, this volcanic
rock dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me, before I forget about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read that to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's high, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Jesse too high at the start of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you take a break and
remember his notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple beers before I came here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the couple of beers made you more
talkative and loosened you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have made you forget what the hell
you were saying, but it did loosen you up
[SPEAKER_00]: a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to call my buddy, Victor at
Innovative Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look him up on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have an Instagram and they
got the phone number at 1-800-508-1856.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can supply these little buckets of
this volcanic rock dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in 10 pound little pells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a, like a half gallon paint
pell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It weighs 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a clue on how much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, I can't even quote the price,
but trust me, it's really cheap,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially considering it replaces all
these other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it lowers your price of growing
significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, in a place where I'm going
6,000 plants, you know, every,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically we grow 6,000 plants every nine
weeks out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can't even fathom that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, what size of pot are those plants in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven gallons when they harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go from a, uh, from a clone to four
inch container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's like a nursery flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's roughly the size of like a
big keg cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, and then it goes to two gallon
polyform pot, also a nursery pot that fits
[SPEAKER_02]: in a tray and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both those containers fit in trays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then they go into a seven gallon
smart pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those smart pots will make them grow
like beasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but, uh, we, we literally cut out
like fucking eight ingredients by using
[SPEAKER_02]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that saves time in mixing when you're
mixing for 6,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't realize how much water and
how much mixing time that is saves time
[SPEAKER_02]: and paperwork saves time and ordering,
but you know, it's not just that it
[SPEAKER_02]: actually is doing its job and it works
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like the way I thought about it as
this much weight is going to end up in my
[SPEAKER_02]: crop now instead of just in that bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to transfer right onto the
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually heard an equation the other day
because we were trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_02]: often we need to re-amend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only about 3% of that is going to end
up in each crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, I mean, you're not going to need to
re-amend it honestly for, if you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it outdoor, you know, possibly ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: One application in your set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we going to put in this,
uh, native soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost cut you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, you keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we've got the, uh, we've got peat and
compost to get it soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we started with clay or sand and we
added the other one and some peat and
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, let's say we've got neem cakes
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've got, we've got the volcanic rock
dust or we've got oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And or, oyster shell is one of the ones
that has properties that this can't
[SPEAKER_02]: completely replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the few things you will need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this basically going to be similar to a
super soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can add kelp, alfalfa,
crustacean meal, uh, good compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: chicken comp, you know, chicken manure,
seabird guano, um, seabird guano would be
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll go into that another time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if that's what's available to you,
use it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, soybean, soybean meal,
feather meal is just, you want to balance
[SPEAKER_02]: out, you know, look at what you're adding
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you want basically shoot for pretty
good balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to, you want a high calcium
input.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, this volcanic rocket ash would,
you know, replace your need for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you don't use it,
your need for azomite, basalt,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, just shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, tons of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, if you were using this,
um, you know, you, you want pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: balanced nitrogens, um, or, you know,
along your MPK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say blood meal, bone meal, uh,
kelp meal, alfalfa meal would be one
[SPEAKER_00]: possible combination, you know,
just, and you'd want them in all even
[SPEAKER_00]: parts basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about what you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow the directions that are in the back
of the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, take the time to figure out how much
soil you're actually working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, if this is our first time,
first time working with the native soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've got our first pot plant in there
and we know how to grow and we're watching
[SPEAKER_00]: it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should we look for, for signs of
trouble that we fucked up that soil so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can try to fix our issues?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, if soil disappear or if water
disappears through it really quick,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still too sandy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if it appears that it's
really low me at first, but after you're
[SPEAKER_02]: watered a few times, you know,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're working with a really,
really sandy soil, um, you're really going
[SPEAKER_02]: to want to add a lot, a lot of peat moss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, probably like one part native soil
with three parts peat moss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can't really overdo Pete,
can you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to be chopping out road
for amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and especially if, you know,
you mulch it up really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's the big worry about mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: About Pete Jesus, um, is that it's going
to dry out really quick if it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: mulched up well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mulch is really important with native
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it helps keep the micro life going
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps with watering issues and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really random question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've covered the native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, if not, don't let us know and
we'll get together next week and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: figure it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may spark a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you said something about the worms are
the best and it made me think of bees,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then I thought about we grow cannabis
and we don't want bees in our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because bees are pollinators.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are bees cool to be around your cannabis
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to, they're not going to
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a couple of places I grow that have
multiple beehives and it's, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: female plants don't produce any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some asshole around here has got a
male outside is always my fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if someone has a male that,
I mean, it's got to be good enough to,
[SPEAKER_02]: for a bee to, for its attention to be
attracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bees only go after really healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, they're, they're looking
for the good premium stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want some busted ass fucking
hermy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I've never had a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen a bee land on a bud,
but it just kind of checked it out and
[SPEAKER_02]: flew away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I, I know that people,
some people aren't completely experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and I know some people are going
to throw some plants outdoors and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them mills or one of them seeds
will be a male and I hope they get it on
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just always wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot of misconceptions
about pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a lot of misconceptions about
bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put them together and that's one
huge double misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we both agree that the bees making THC
honey is total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What he was doing is a commercial bee
farmers feed their bees corn syrup in the
[SPEAKER_02]: winter because they stole all their honey
from them, which is the bees natural food,
[SPEAKER_02]: good holistic honey farmers don't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only take a smaller yield instead of
taking it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: The commercial farmers are like,
well, we'll just feed them fucking corn
[SPEAKER_02]: syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually part of what continued
contributed to the, uh, colony collapse
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything be dialed is because their
corn syrup is full of fucking roundup
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're getting the cheap fucking
GMO fucking corn syrup and it's not even
[SPEAKER_02]: food grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the stuff that like, ah, fuck the
aphids are back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like give it a double dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause it's, it's livestock grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't even have to be tested for
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bees are eating roundup and of
course it's fucking killing them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that dude in France, what he did is he
took corn syrup and sprayed it on that
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bees were trained to go to the fucking
corn syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have no scientific proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of grew up on a like really
big ass bee farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I know how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I watched that video and I know that
bud looks really sticky and this is just
[SPEAKER_02]: my own conclusion, but I'm pretty sure
that's what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's called THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A stands for acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, have you ever been trimming and rubbed
your eye?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the worst fucking thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns and it stings for like an hour
and your eyes kind of stuck shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine a little tiny bee landing on there
and tasting that and he's going to go fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: this and he's going to fly off.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that was my first, the pH of that
trichome is going to disrupt that bees
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be on the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that was what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to check what pH of, uh,
like most pollen is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could actually be a really strong
argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting my statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dude, you said he wanted to do
a 30 minute podcast because you had
[SPEAKER_00]: something to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was nearly 40 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything that you want to add
to this, uh, before we wrap it up so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get you out of here to handle your
business?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't apologize for being a little
buzzed because I like beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, you were a wonderful podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would have told me you drank a
couple of beers, I would have never known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I actually had some really good
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of beer did you drink?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Adele's Pale Ale, which anyone that
knows me knows that's my go-to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, then I had, uh, Adele's fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some kind of seasonal IPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the citrus one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, Adele's.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a new Belgium.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't drank in probably real men
don't have fruit in their beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think that might be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't drank any alcohol in eight ish
years, eight to 10 ish years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only drank one time because I was
with a boss at a job and he bought beers
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's like, have a beer with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you do today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I didn't drink,
I used to hate that situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just get wasted from a beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I miss, I wish I could drink a Sammy
Smith's oatmeal stout, not a Sam Adams,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Sammy Smith's from England.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in an Imperial pint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they've got the gold.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get the gold off,
you drink it and you shit a little gold in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning, but they make an oatmeal
stout and a Teddy Porter, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the beers to go to when I would
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stand that IPA light shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like piss to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a beer that's like maple syrup
coming out of the fucking can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hold that bottle upside down for a
few minutes stouts and Porter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab and then go try to trick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a drink and it might've poured out by
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super into, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I appreciate all beer except for like
that beer, beer truck beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd I call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That flat piss, hot water beer,
anything concert beer imported from Mexico
[SPEAKER_02]: or is in a green bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want to drink it to
Katé.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that shit's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that shit's poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get diarrhea just from the beer,
not the hangover.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally, I can say 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only support, um, local American
breweries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like real small, you know, cause even new
Belgium compared to Budweiser is a small
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And new Belgium's, you know, the Sierra
Nevada Porter with the blue label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to drink a shit ton of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That and a steak, baked potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's drooling you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a big man beard and now it's
coated in drool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a savage wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thanks for tolerating, tolerating a
beer talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys haven't talked about beer in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, drink if you'd like, I just can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot drink responsibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we make gross stones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they say on the Adam Dunn show,
you know, when you're emptying beer
[SPEAKER_02]: bottles, you're making gross stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol and I do not get along,
but if you can do that, you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably dab more than most people
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to each their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, if I did leave anything out,
leave anyone guessing, or if you just want
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask some more questions, man,
feel free to hit me or Jeff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way is probably a grow from your
heart at a hotmail.com that comes right to
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone, my iPad, my computer pretty much
rings in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will see your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, a lot of people send me
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am getting to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't always reply to your message
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they just reply on the show
because I'm like, Hey, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so listen, and I've got a lot of
emails in my phone that I haven't gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: to put podcasts together for yet,
but it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you sent me a message like six
months ago, it may pop up as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a podcast here in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you want, even if you're not social
media type, uh, you can hit me up on green
[SPEAKER_02]: chill genetics at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All one word that's old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap it up on the green chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you
guys for listening to a podcast about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to amend your native soil, wherever you
are, whatever you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can adjust it now to make it work for
your cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jesse, thanks for coming and hanging
out, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't look, can't wait to see you in a
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got drunk from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward and can't wait to seeing
you in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was harder to say than it should have
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back here in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to,
uh, Jesse's pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all we've got for this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for
listening until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mama a hug
for me.
I
[SPEAKER_01]: have no sunglasses.
I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.
What
[SPEAKER_01]: happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: I live down the sidewalk, like a trucking
process fool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke every single traffic rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
