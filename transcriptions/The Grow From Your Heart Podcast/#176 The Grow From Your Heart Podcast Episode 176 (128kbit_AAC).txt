[SPEAKER_08]: .
[SPEAKER_00]: .
[SPEAKER_00]: .
[SPEAKER_00]: .
.
[SPEAKER_00]: .
.
.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have a, there's no
science that has, I could quote that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would feel comfortable saying it's this
kind of percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just from everything, I mean,
your skin is your largest organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's obviously when you get in a tub
of hot water, it's absorbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know epsom salts and those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just collecting on and absorbing into
your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, the effects that they have had is
they say that it's the best night's sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: they've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, I had pulled my back and I
took a bath and the next morning they,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, they might still be sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to at least function or get
to work still, or get to the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to call a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I believe in my opinion that
it helps people with, especially out here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado, dry skin, psoriasis,
things like that, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: are topical issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any topical, it's being absorbed
through your skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they do hydrate your skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel very soft when you get out of the
tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's oils in there, essential,
like not just essential oils as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: scents, but there's like MCT oil and
coconut oils and almond oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's not coconut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is sweet almond oils sometimes used
and depending on which flavors or scents,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all those things, like they're all
made just a little bit different and
[SPEAKER_00]: specific specifically, but so yeah,
I mean, it's just those oils carry the
[SPEAKER_00]: cabininoids into the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's definitely an absorption,
but to give you an exact quote on a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage, I have no scientific facts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think, just personally,
do you think somebody that did not smoke
[SPEAKER_08]: or consume edibles or anything,
would they pass a drug test from using a
[SPEAKER_08]: bath bomb?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but we could probably find a
candidate to test.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know somebody that doesn't smoke
that you want to drop a bath bomb on?
[SPEAKER_08]: We could talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually, I have some curious
friends that are not cannabis consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: that because again, there's no high to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any THC in it at all from the CBD
that your skin will absorb?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I mean, try a THC one to see
if they get in through the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we need somebody who doesn't consume,
which so that might be a test that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to try just to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I mean, you can buy a test
at the grocery store and.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because that would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anybody that doesn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know somebody, but I don't know if
they would be down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know one person that would be down for
it, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find a test subject sometime soon
and I'll report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can't find one, let me know because
I know one for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make it a project.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very curious because you said the skin
is the largest organ.
[SPEAKER_08]: If our lungs take in so much, how much can
our skin absorb?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully.
Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all just going to be slathering up
with THC creams pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because otherwise to all topicals,
I mean, they wouldn't work if it if our
[SPEAKER_08]: skin wasn't absorbing any Arnica gel,
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those products are excellent
sources of pain relief, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: specific areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a topical?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not trying to recreate the
wheel with this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our goal is to find new inventive
ways and connoisseur grade type products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at like we're not that much more
expensive than the big guys that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so for a few dollars more,
you can have something that's completely
[SPEAKER_00]: clean if that's your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have smoked BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be a snob like I've
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all I mean, it's right here on the
table.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's plenty here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sick and I don't have cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't make that decision for somebody
who might have a more serious condition
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't affect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm willing to take that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else might not want to have to
take that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to offer those people a
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry, I got off point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're going beautifully.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I'm not trying to recreate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a topical that I'm wanting to
bring out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to go, like I said,
connoisseur grade and I'm looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing out a body butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, dry skin again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big effect out here in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sunburns and you know, there's
already the topicals in the salves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be something that not only
nourishes your skin, smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's that connoisseur grade
body, mall body product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to the mall, pay the same
amount of money or you can pay the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of money and you can get it with
cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still equally has all those
effects, but you will get additional
[SPEAKER_00]: effects if you have a need for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can smell like strawberries and
watermelons and have THC all at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what one of the things that I'm
working on.
[SPEAKER_08]: What type of price point do the
suppositories go for?
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody wants to think about doing
this?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're not the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're the distributor and the
maker, so you don't set the price,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the retail price runs, I want to say
right around $16.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for 50, 50 milligrams for 12
hours of Medicaid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about what kind of what do
you need the medicine for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, for somebody who doesn't
have pain, buying a topical is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, doesn't have sore muscles or a
joint ache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you buy a topical that's a
salve?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about application and what you
need it for is, in my personal opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: is where you're willing to spend your
money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know of dispensaries in the
Colorado Springs, Denver area where people
[SPEAKER_08]: can grab these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a list of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can become prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm prepared, but not overly prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me a second to pull that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect for the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say we're going to shout out
one of our favorite dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Epic Remedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually just swung through there right
before we did the podcast and I picked up
[SPEAKER_05]: a whole bunch of dabble products from
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grabbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went in there earlier this morning and
we walked in and shout out to Dusty in
[SPEAKER_05]: there because Dusty was like, drop
happening later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just picked up a syringe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I grabbed like a oh,
I grabbed a New York City diesel shatter
[SPEAKER_05]: from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like it looked it looked pretty
good in the container, which is why I
[SPEAKER_05]: scooped it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But man, when you open it, it is that's it
right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked honestly like I would compare it
to a very well known.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is dabble.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is craft, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would call that one real expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I was just going to say to
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to pass this around so
everybody can try this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's exactly what I was going to
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first thing I said when it came
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, oh, and it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they carry a lot of shout out to
Epic Remedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dusty and everybody in there always hooks
us up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their prices are very, very
affordable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a deal going every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product that we are shortly coming
out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a solvent list of edibles,
but we're also the pen market is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The you know, the vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have a solvent list pen
out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, will be available in our
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wanted to know where we are in the
Springs area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, so what I want to disclose
before I give you this list is not
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody carries all of our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to contact if
that's your suspensory and ask them,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, do you have their rosin or their
suppositories?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of them carry some of it,
but not all of our products.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time this comes out, that may have
changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: This will be out Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A Wellness here in the Colorado or in
the Springs area, the 64 store,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabacare, Tweedleaf and Grant Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stained Glass is a huge supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mindful Elevations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously Epic Remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enlighten Care and I think that's Green
Meds, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the Green Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is Green Meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do have one partner that we're
working with up in Fort Collins and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are just doing amazing things up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Natural Alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Denver area, we've got Live Green,
which is patient's choice on Colfax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Affinity is on Colfax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be Good carries our stuff up in North
Glen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Fields is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their sister store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they have two stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in Denver and one up North.
[SPEAKER_08]: People in other states are probably
punching something going.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have all these places to go buy weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little Brown House in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lotus Medical has us downtown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lush Standing Akimbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Giving Tree and Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my favorite dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's encouraged me to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the way they're set up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the way they handle business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: The grow, the medicine, the people,
the quality, the products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind Love is a nice dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they carry suppositories there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bath Bombs right now is what they're
carrying with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes they've got the best clones
I've ever seen available in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually got some of our original
clones for our grow from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we worked with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shannon has been working hard on her grow
for her company.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still a small company, but we've got
a great chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brent, our grower does a great job in the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our two majority owners are really just
doing a great job running the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just happy to be part of all of it
and be able to meet people like you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're glad to have you on to teach people
about suppositories.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a Pueblo place where people
can buy it by any chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please, if you're in the Pueblo area
and you have a dispensary that wants our
[SPEAKER_00]: product, go in and ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need you guys to ask for our
products and that will help me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it medical only or rec too?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just went rec not too long ago,
but on the rec side we're limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our grows not quite establish it
on the rec side for that first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're only working on ancillary
products being bath bombs and
[SPEAKER_00]: suppositories can be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody needs them on the rec side
too, of course, I'm happy to fulfill those
[SPEAKER_00]: needs too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Start making the requests, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Start asking your dispensary owners.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to the dispensary, they don't
have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on Traveling Stoner and Dab and
Granny, and I'm not popular, but on my
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram as well, there is a list of all
these dispensaries that you can find that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've shouted out for me and been so
helpful to help promote for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon, you are one of the cool kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm cool with not being the cool kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to hang out with y'all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instagram doesn't make you famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: You brought great content, so we
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know everyone's already following the
Traveling Stoner and the Dab and Granny,
[SPEAKER_08]: but if you're not, go follow them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Find those list of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are recreational dispensaries on the
list.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're coming from out of state,
if you're coming from another country,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're 21 and over, you can get these
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can take a bath.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can drop a bath bomb in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get a suppository.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can put that where the sun don't
shine.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I endorse these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to tell your dispensary who to
contact, my Instagram name is
[SPEAKER_00]: sserendipity93.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that I'm the CGC manager on there
and marketing manager and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they can DM me, they can Instagram
me, they can call me directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm definitely accessible if
they have questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get in touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys heard that hissing sound,
that is not a deadly cobra.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a can of butane refilling a torch
because Bobo over here needs a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he just gave Lindsay a dab on
death.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to take a macro of it because he
just gave me the most... Is it a turptail?
[SPEAKER_05]: He put a piece of shatter, then he dipped
it in the CBD and then he just coated it
[SPEAKER_05]: in distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm watching him and I'm like,
is he going to stop putting distillate on
[SPEAKER_05]: it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he going to stop putting distillate?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got for CBD?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the spiderweb all the... It was the
spiderweb all the CBD I said on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was falling off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're missing the nail, brother man.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's trying to get on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch my dreads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's all I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three people in the room with dreads.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could see this table, I'm sitting
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking in, I forget that this isn't the
norm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, if this was Texas, we'd all go to
prison for life for what's on this table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have probably, I don't know,
probably 10 tubes of distillate out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's two, four, six, seven,
eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are 10 tubes of distillate within my
site.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably another 10 containers of turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shatter.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two ounces of shatter in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven rigs on the table,
[SPEAKER_08]: an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just how we roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, Shannon, stick it inside of here so
it heats up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's unheated, unopened distillate.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people would be mad at us for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: What other states would we go to prison
for?
[SPEAKER_08]: Kentucky, Texas.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'd come in the front door and just
take us to jail forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida still, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Granny, a minute ago, you started to hint
to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still so high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to the dad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I'm going to get you talking about
your Vegas trip and I'm going to take a
[SPEAKER_08]: dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who has invited you and the grumpy grandpa
to Vegas?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something I'm very excited about
because anybody that follows me on social
[SPEAKER_03]: media knows that my husband is very sick,
but he's getting better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we got him off them damn opioids
and he's on cannabis, he's much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's come out of that zombified
pharmaceutical trance he was in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And beta glass labs out of Philadelphia
called me two weeks ago and said,
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny, you know what champs is?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of would like to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, well, we'll fly you and
grumpy grandpa out there together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, you're kidding me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, no, we'd like to have the
both of you come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put you up in a hotel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, I've got to talk it over
with my husband.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hung up and I asked Kevin and he
said, I feel pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if I have to stay in my hotel room,
I think you and I can take a trip to
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to beta glass labs for making
this trip come true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see some great glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been like five years since you guys
have taken any kind of vacation together
[SPEAKER_03]: because he's been so sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been blessed lately, granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had lots of good things come my way.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been doing things correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you reap what you sow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not out there to make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out there to, well, I'm out to promote
a lot of young artists that I see here in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out to help educate about cannabis and
I'm out to have fun while I do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you were achieving all three of
those goals this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are coming to fruition though.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, okay guys, tonight here we sit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we had all those products on
the table, something we didn't say shout
[SPEAKER_03]: out to Clyde side edibles from Glasgow,
Scotland, all the way from Scotland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a care package yesterday of edibles
and t-shirts from Glasgow, Scotland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I opened them up and everybody was
like, Ooh, I'll tell you what,
[SPEAKER_03]: their edibles are pretty darn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That chocolate marshmallow thing looked
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked very dense, but man,
it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just glad that it was only THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We joked about some of this, maybe having
possible other.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've still got these little chocolate,
not chocolate, these hard candies.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are pineapple chunks made with sour
diesel cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're 50 milligrams per bag,
2.5 milligrams per cube.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cubes are small and they remind me of
some mescaline I got on fish stool one
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was very apprehensive to eat these.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not eat any.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of my friends that did eat them seem
to be okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They smell good, but they look,
those little squares look very suspicious
[SPEAKER_08]: to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, nobody's hallucinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would even think that you would be
eating THC edibles from Scotland?
[SPEAKER_03]: From Scotland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I got to say they have
really big balls in Scotland because not
[SPEAKER_00]: only did they ship this to her,
but they had it labeled right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweets and t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did he say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I said to him, well, I want to
know what does a Scotsman wear under his
[SPEAKER_03]: guilt?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, if they're a true Scotsman
like me, nothing, it's balls in the wind.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these edibles were made by a dude not
wearing any underwear.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I hope he wasn't scratching.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had a skirt on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes it easier to insert his suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably send him back a care
package.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not messing with shipping anything to
Scotland.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll wait a few more years on that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: None of us said that either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only did I get something from
Glasgow, Scotland, I'm going to shout out
[SPEAKER_03]: long bong official.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I tell the whole world?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that porn?
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now these guys have a like, it's like a
six foot bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell the whole story too,
if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if you're on Instagram, you will see
this big six foot bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will say it looks kind of appealing
and it's metal and crystal and it's called
[SPEAKER_03]: Stanley kind of like flat Stanley.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to travel around to
different weed people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I had messaged this company,
not knowing anything about them saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, can Stanley come to my house to
review?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, yes, he could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple of months later,
they said, granny, we, we can't secure
[SPEAKER_03]: Stanley.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't secure Stanley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, well, we'll get back to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a month ago, they say to me,
granny custom grow four 20 has Stanley and
[SPEAKER_03]: he won't respond to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: He will not give Stanley back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So custom grow is holding Stanley hostage.
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes Stanley.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not going to give Stanley back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that probably is no big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a company here in the United
States, I'd just go find custom grow four
[SPEAKER_03]: 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are in Slovakia, which is the
former Czechoslovakia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no chase in custom grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told them, I can't find custom grow
four 20, but I'll, I'll tell everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody this story.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can tell everybody that follows all of
us on Twitter and that listened to this
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast to send a message to custom grow
and be like, return Stanley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this company was so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent me their second bong,
which is called T O T E O.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is hand blown, uh, Czechoslovakian
crystal, Bohemian crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: How tall would you say it is from the
table?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four inches tall, probably easily,
easily, because if I stand up,
[SPEAKER_03]: the mouthpiece is right where I'm
standing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I'm pretty tall Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a tall lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they sent me this bong and I really
like it, but I, who's going to get a bong
[SPEAKER_03]: ship from Slovakia.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only dad and granny, only dad and granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that thing hit?
[SPEAKER_03]: I get hella high off that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen the video on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's real bubbly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That perk is like, so it's, uh,
or describe the shape of it for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You told us how tall it looks kind of like
a big crystal leader, two liter bottle,
[SPEAKER_03]: three liter bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's this metal perk that,
and it's all done on a lathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a video up where you can
actually see them making it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know people are like, Ooh,
I don't want to smoke on a metal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an old hippie.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just smoked out a way worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I still use a big glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't bring your hip wick toward me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get my, you can't get your bowl
hot enough to fill your lungs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to light the hemp wick with a
lighter and then light my bowl with the
[SPEAKER_08]: hemp wick and then shake that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, you have to have a candle going.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too many damn things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a lighter and smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's like a three liter bottle
with this perk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's this great big tall piece
that comes up off the top that you fill
[SPEAKER_03]: with ice gives hella rips, but it's not
really practical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you put it down somewhere,
it should stay there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks really heavy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very crystal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even, it is crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that crystal is thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I think it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: They shipped it to you from Slovakia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they thought I spoke Slovakian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was trying to be nice and I
Googled, I Googled simple Slovakian
[SPEAKER_03]: phrases and I cut and paste and they
replied with a paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh no, I don't speak
Slovakian.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just being polite help Google
translator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to long bong official.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That bong is amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't say bong very much anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know because we all dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be the bong champ.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like smoking out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have to clean my bong and go at it
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, maybe the next time we say I'll
have to take it apart, but there's screws
[SPEAKER_03]: to take.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some assembly is required.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bring it to Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll do a few bong rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I do a few more shout outs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now on my Instagram, I got a really
nice giveaway going on with freaky smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: shop here in the Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have a email, a rig that Lindsay and
I've been smoking out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I took a titanium pencil and I,
uh, signed the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says peace, Deb and granny 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a few other gibbies,
give a few other, what do you call them?

[SPEAKER_03]: Some more swag to give away.
[SPEAKER_03]: God dang.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all might be medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I can't even think of simple words,
it's bad or is it anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the one thing I want to say is I
reached 250,000 followers on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've surpassed that even now.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time this comes out, you'll be way
past that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at two 52 or two, but that just amazes
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am going to be doing a hell of a
appreciation giveaway.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I know beta glass
labs is going to donate one of their rigs
[SPEAKER_03]: to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then somebody I absolutely adore here in
the Springs, pop the glass is already
[SPEAKER_03]: blown a piece to give me for the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet I can get a few other nice little
glass blowers here in the Springs to give
[SPEAKER_03]: us some nice things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just be keeping an eye out for my two
50 giveaway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course I've got to thank my
sponsors, the bottle is four 20 and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: back to rep and mega talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually like smoking concentrate
out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I'm done shouting out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a shout out to elevate
while we're always elevate class.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all need elevate class.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole crew over at elevate the
beautiful ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're all elevate dolls.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those dudes are dolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked him, what do I call you?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I'm a doll.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up turtle?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, maybe we should shout out a few
companies that we've been getting our CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: from, because some of these companies,
um, even new people in states that aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: legal, you can order CBD and so far
they're still delivering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I can direct you to empire wellness
.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think anybody that's sampled their,
uh, CBD tonight or their terps,
[SPEAKER_03]: their Terps are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've helped me get medicine to
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, all bank distillate dads here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, he is still shipping nationwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trinity terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they're still shipping nationwide and
Fido family.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still shipping nationwide.
Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're still shipping nationwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still shipping to dab and granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe even, Oh, and, uh, John Ramsey,
what's his company in infinite CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still shipping.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see those guys talking about it on
Facebook and Instagram all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to get CBD out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to all the CBD warriors.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing I will say is we've got a
lot of great CBD manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extractors, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we also have a lot of,
we have these CBD wars where they're all
[SPEAKER_03]: biting and scratching at each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't, I won't deal with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not endorse just one company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will endorse them all because then
they've got to be nice to all our
[SPEAKER_03]: followers.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens in the seed game also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure Jeff, you can probably speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, the older I get, the more I'm like,
well, this is stupid.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just chill out and be nice to each
other and do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's room for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: There shouldn't be a competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough of us patients and
consumers out there that none of you are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to go out of business.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can smoke all of this hash on this
table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I needed a provider for more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lindsay, you doubt me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm laughing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause Bo just tried to smell a glass
syringe, like in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So does it have any smell, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you, have you tried that one yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, please do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to ask you, who's is
this?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these companies and their
packaging are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: This package is what else comes in a
package this size, like toothpaste almost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the pad, the product that comes in it
is I'm trying to find something.
[SPEAKER_08]: What else is this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing else is this size.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing else is this small.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have to put it in that
plastic as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to put it in this box with
everything printed on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we put it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: This syringe is a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's a bigger syringe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes more sense, but still couldn't
the labeling go on to here, but then it
[SPEAKER_08]: wouldn't be consumer friendly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the packaging, oh my, so much packaging
in Colorado, you guys garbage is what I
[SPEAKER_03]: call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all landfill material unless you
recycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know a lot of people that should,
that don't my neighborhood doesn't support
[SPEAKER_08]: much recycling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and you know what, if, if your trash
company isn't going to help you,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hard to recycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's admit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you compost, don't you?
[SPEAKER_08]: I do what I can, but I can't compost
everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have enough space and some stuff
stinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want that in your home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you talked about actually,
when you talked on one of your podcasts
[SPEAKER_03]: about some of the things and I was like,
Oh, his house smelt like a home,
[SPEAKER_08]: not like a nail in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I've got my Boca.
[SPEAKER_08]: She bucket is right over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't smell it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff's home is very pleasant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it looks like it's a dude's house.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could use a, it could use a cleaning,
but you have a pink bathroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, back to the pink bathroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a shout out to all my
triplet friends in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's wearing their girl from your
heart podcast hoodie and looking super
[SPEAKER_08]: sexy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to my friends at handmade
apparel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I'm supposed to do an ad for
handmade apparel.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys need some printing done,
you please do please use me.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a reference about both of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if you need hoodies, t-shirts,
if you need hat pins, if you need
[SPEAKER_08]: stickers, you need some stuff printed and
you want it to look sharp.
[SPEAKER_08]: How dope are the colors on those hoodies?
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, they're vivid.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're bright.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys washed yours?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have washed mine twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: They still look brand new.
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually look sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: No cracks in the back or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but do you do, are you, are you
friendly to your hoodie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you turn it inside out?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should turn it inside out when you
wash it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll last even longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it won't crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff won't crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause then your, your logo is not beaten
on the parts of the washer.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dryer is not heating up,
you know, the actual logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like making it stick together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life hack teaching people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happens when you're 60,
not 25.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I'm getting, getting up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're starting to learn all them little
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of the original, I read
genetic shirts, the very first batch
[SPEAKER_08]: printed by handmade.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's probably, I'm going to guess this
is seven years old and it's just now
[SPEAKER_08]: starting.
[SPEAKER_08]: To kind of starting at the edges to look
weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's crackling, but the shirt is like
not even black anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all dingy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically a work shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of your favorite concert
t-shirts.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've got, I bought a lot of these
shirts and I think most of the extra extra
[SPEAKER_08]: larges went to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if there's a festival,
excuse me for the cough guys, if there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: festival, if there's an event,
brand new ivory shirt, just got to rock
[SPEAKER_08]: the brand new one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I try to set it aside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I forget and I end up wearing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm like, Oh, there's another
event brand new ivory shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys really should order one of your
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are nice hoodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are real and they're really warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a coat on tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a little camisole underneath it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris and I went camping for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went January 2nd, we got in the car and
we went camping and it was snowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was snowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 20 degrees that night.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, uh, I wore the grow from your heart
podcast, uh, sweatshirt all night.
[SPEAKER_05]: With like, um, probably like two layers
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was so warm all night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was not, I didn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super cozy hoodies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a double advertisement right
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys shout out to our friends and
handmade apparel, handmade apparel dot
[SPEAKER_08]: biz.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also if you need a hoodie,
grow from your heart at hotmail.com,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to pull one of these hoodies in
your hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd look sexy in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He looks so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: All your friends will be like,
what's that grow from your heart?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you'd be like, yeah, it's a
podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tell everybody that when we go places.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've secretly gotten asked multiple times
what this hoodie is on multiple occasions.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tell people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the back is the best because you got
Rasta Jeff's cheesy face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is super cheesy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes you smile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, you know, I have to go in the
bathroom and just turn around and put my
[SPEAKER_03]: camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They gave me a really friendly deal
because of what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, dude, we want to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, go for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's a lot of color in this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like nine colors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to our friends at handmade
apparel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, since we talked about all the other
companies that we were supporting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lindsay, don't you have a few new
sponsors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, nothing you want to talk about right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, I mean, I can let you guys know
that my website will be up and running at
[SPEAKER_05]: the end of the month.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my blog, the blog portion of my website
will at least be up and running at the end
[SPEAKER_05]: of the month.
[SPEAKER_08]: The end of which month?
[SPEAKER_05]: This month.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've actually been working really
hard on it and it will be out at the end
[SPEAKER_05]: of this month because I have nothing else
that I am working on right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the only thing I've been working
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will definitely be out at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only reason I troll you is because I
know that's funny because I didn't realize
[SPEAKER_05]: I had said that at the end of the last
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny because it's nodding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he saw me setting it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was setting it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris was like, Oh, let me do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so since granny reminded me and it was
in my notes, I didn't even open my
[SPEAKER_08]: notebook because we had so much to talk
about on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: My notes stayed on the floor.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all organic and natural.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, how was the food drive you guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: How did that go?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know, I actually, the day that they
picked everything up, I was at my sister's
[SPEAKER_05]: wedding in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to granny and Sam and Bailey
and everybody else that came out and
[SPEAKER_03]: helped Sam, Bailey and I, and then the,
um, people at the Marion house.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we pulled up at night,
you haul and those people were on the dock
[SPEAKER_03]: and I opened it up and she went,
and I got out of the truck and I came up
[SPEAKER_03]: and I said, I wasn't going to tell you
until I got here, but this all came from
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes, where did you get all this
food?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, all the food and there's toys
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's money in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it all came from dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting my hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could see it in your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me so happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, wow, you guys really
made a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a U haul truck from ceiling to
floor, front to back that was full of
[SPEAKER_03]: food, toys.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some, um, brand new kids,
hats, gloves, lots of new toys for the
[SPEAKER_03]: kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I spoke with the lady,
I was so impressed with this program and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all through the Marion house Catholic
charities.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not religious, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had, do you know what I mean by
gorilla shelves?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those metal shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had several of those different
categories and they have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: displaced families.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to get back on track.
[SPEAKER_03]: The parents have to take parenting
classes, which I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good because if you're young,
you know, I was young and dumb once too,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get a lot of people coming here
because of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This community and they don't have a plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a solid plan in place and
sometimes kids, kids suffer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, these gorilla shelves have brand
new toys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's kids birthday, they get to
come in and they get to pick a brand new
[SPEAKER_03]: toy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had so many brand new diapers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go down there and get,
if you need diapers, people, you can go
[SPEAKER_03]: down to the Marion house and get diapers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no questions asked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diapers are expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just felt, yes, we did make a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that seems like an eternity ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a while ago, but thank you for
doing it because of the smile on your face
[SPEAKER_08]: right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's priceless.
[SPEAKER_08]: It made me really happy to know that we
helped so many people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only imagine the looks on the little
kids faces when they, cause they know the
[SPEAKER_08]: little kids know like we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't get nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know they can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their parents don't tell them,
but they know we live in a thing and we
[SPEAKER_08]: aren't getting stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they get a present and they're
like, Oh my God, I got a $5 dinosaur that
[SPEAKER_08]: made my day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kids, you know, kids shouldn't have to
be punished for business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Lindsay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you weren't there on the day,
but you had a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a big shout out to Bailey
too, for being a part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, actually I put up that post
tonight that we were doing the podcast and
[SPEAKER_05]: she commented on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, yes, I've been looking for the
name of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big shout out to Bailey cause Rocky
mountain dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I met her at the Halloween party.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't super talkative at the Halloween
party cause I was in the Chewbacca costume
[SPEAKER_08]: and I kind of overheated myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_08]: And spinning around in circles.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, big shout out to Bailey because
she, uh, she got up and helped granny and
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam without any questions asked on a day
off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was cold that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, she only, she's a bud tender
at, um, Rocky mountain medical over on
[SPEAKER_05]: garden of the gods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you know, she probably only gets
a couple of days a week off and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_05]: she didn't have, she has a lot of medical
conditions that, you know, make it hard
[SPEAKER_05]: for her to stay mobile sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last time they sent her home from the
hospital with a walker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's what?
[SPEAKER_03]: 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's about my age.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big shout out to Bailey for,
you know, we love you, baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a trooper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also a big shout out to THC Samuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: For helping with that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also just for being THC Samuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Sam has a lot to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam was just out on the west coast,
started down in San Francisco with JD
[SPEAKER_03]: Mapleson.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all heavy glassblowers guys
started down in San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_03]: worked his way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, spent the night with Derby homes and
the homes family and ended his trip with
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Snodgrass, 85 year old legend in the
glass blowing world in the school block
[SPEAKER_03]: bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam has a lot to talk about from this last
trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get Samuel on the show and
he's the perfect person for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he just, I love him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, when I say these are heavy
glassblowers, I don't know if any of us
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting here can probably afford any of
these pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love you, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone Sam texts me that he was at Derby
homes and, and we, Sam and I have come to
[SPEAKER_03]: know the homes family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, all I could afford was a carb
cap and the carb cap is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm telling you guys, that wasn't like
a five, 10, 20, $30 a hundred.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no, it's a beautiful dyke row.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's peach, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's peach.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it has these two green leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a gorgeous carb cap and it's a
directional flow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it is a truly solidly gorgeous piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these glass blowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them pieces are a house.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say that's a car sitting on
the shelf right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, shout out to THC Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get them on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Sam and I both have been survivors of
head injuries and Sam of course has had a
[SPEAKER_08]: couple more than me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got one major one and one when I was
a youth, but we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: head injuries and we're going to talk
about petty glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll get Sam on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also going to talk about the East
coast because he's from the East coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask him some weed questions
about the East coast and see what he's got
[SPEAKER_08]: to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big shout out to Sam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to everybody that helped in the
food drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to every dispensary that
allowed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_08]: My throat's bright to you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me one good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should say that it wasn't just
dispensaries that did this just before you
[SPEAKER_05]: start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause like Canada Canyon was a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the family joint, the lazy lion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elevate glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elevate the glass grind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, DBK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Marion and Dylan is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a whole list of them on my phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to all the, everybody that let us
have a drop off spot, a box and everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: that brought stuff to the boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all those folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give a special shout out
though to Epic remedy again for this
[SPEAKER_03]: honest to God.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what cemented my relationship with
Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had lots of people that took our boxes,
but this is what Epic remedy did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't care how many cans of new food you
brought in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave you a dollar per can off your
product that you were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after a week, I was like rents.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the owner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're taking a hit and he goes,
I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the holidays.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're giving back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to rents and Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, that dispensary was in the
poorest neighborhood of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries that was over in Pike's peak
park over on circle and fountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is one of the poorest neighborhoods
that have any of the dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they collected the most food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gail had to go over there countless of
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like honestly, we ran the thing for like
about three weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there probably twice a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two to three times a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was going over there and picking up
not just like a box full pallets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like she had to take the truck over there
and the entire truck was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: every time I would get like pictures and
like just got back from Epic remedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to, uh, seventh floor silver
server Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really anticipate getting as
much stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going to hold it all at the glass
grind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when, when Epic remedy called me
the first time and I drive a Silverado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the entire back of my truck was full of
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve said, can you have my warehouse?
[SPEAKER_03]: So he let us store all the food out there
for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when I did get the, you haul his
whole crew loaded the truck up for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to the entire seven floor
vapes crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they, they were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we doing next?
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start working on another food drive
or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something to help the community definitely
have to do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about it on the next episode
when we bring granny on again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent brainstorm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam is coming up with lots of good ideas
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sam's a thinker.
[SPEAKER_08]: That kid's head never stops.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just brain keeps just spinning.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys check out THC magazine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the finest cover on a magazine ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got the best, uh, I don't know
what the, whatever print stock they use
[SPEAKER_08]: that stuff is glossy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's available in Barnes and noble across
the nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like anybody anywhere can get it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm in this month's episode or no,
it's not episode issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an awesome picture of me,
the Hedy ambassador and action Branson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did action say to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said I was going to come on ancient
aliens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him, well, I see you smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke a lot of blunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your friends can't be sitting on the
couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to leave room on the couch for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to break in all these
heavy pieces that I know you just bought
[SPEAKER_03]: today at heaters.
[SPEAKER_08]: How did he feel about all that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Three pieces.
[SPEAKER_08]: You bought three sweet pieces.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got three, at least three dads
coming with, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some of them are buck pieces too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: You told me that he made, he gave you a
quote and what was Bronson's quote of the
[SPEAKER_08]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: What he said he had to go do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you asked him to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you have to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't do impressions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, but it's still funny just knowing
Bronson.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, he's got this thick Bronx accent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, let's go get a sausage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, what did you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just kind of looked at me and I
said, say it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love the way it sounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you people from New York say sausages
appealing to one's ears.
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably feel the same about us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Weird Colorado folks probably think we say
some funny shit ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really is a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hope I get to sit down with him
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you get to be on the ancient alien
show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope maybe vice just comes and does a
dab and granny show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you deserve some recognition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of shows, I believe, uh,
the traveling stoner and Bobo just did an
[SPEAKER_03]: episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I please give a shout out to daily
bong?
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to daily bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Daily bong just had Chris and I on,
um, blunted a season two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it was actually really funny
because like we get there and like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, he, he, he had messaged me like,
honestly, he messaged me a month ago and
[SPEAKER_05]: he was like, Hey, I'm thinking,
you know, I'm going to be coming out into,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Colorado and I'd love to get you and
your man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on there, I just really like y'all's
vibes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to be on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew about the show because of metal
Damien.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so he, uh, he's on the show all the
time because it's filmed in Miami.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, so I said, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then he messaged me at the beginning of
the month and he's like, Oh, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be out there on the 15th and 16th.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, coolio.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get there and I really, I just have
watched the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that the way the show goes is
you sit in front of a really bright light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you wear sunglasses and you smoke
either like a joint or a blunt or
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he asks you questions and you just
answer them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like the questions are, you know,
in the bottom of the, uh, of the like
[SPEAKER_05]: screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just knew that we were going to get
asked questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, he had put up a picture that
morning and he had tagged a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't really know how, how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he doesn't let anybody like be around
each other when they get taped.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're on the same episode and
like, you can get be in the same room.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get there and he goes, Oh,
you're episodes all about relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I stone face.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you picked the wrong couple,
dude, straight up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You pick the wrong couple.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are a great couple.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just not the classic TV show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if that's what you were looking for
out of this, you pick the wrong couple.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really funny because it was like
the newlywed game style kind of like we
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't even stay in the room with each
other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he asked us pretty much the same
questions and like to see how we answer
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was pretty comical to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our episode is supposed to come out at the
end of March.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're episode four of season two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he, um, text me yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he, he'll be back here at the end of
January and asked what I may become up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm asking if maybe you guys will take
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daily bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Daily bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to them because they,
it was so much fun to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: He asked just like, I mean, just,
I don't want to spoil our, our episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll tell you what's been on other
episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really funny cause I,
I was at the Canna Canyon a couple of days
[SPEAKER_05]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to spoil somebody else's
episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's season one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I was at the Canna Canyon the other
day and I was showing Camille like the day
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, yo, look at what I get to go
and do the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm kind of excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was the only person I told.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even tell granny, like granny
called me on the way up and she's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, okay, I'm going to do this
really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was showing Camille this and it was
really funny because the question was ice
[SPEAKER_05]: cream or anal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the amount of like guys that chose ice
cream was insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was so funny to me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just mind blowing to me and me
and Cam were both like, I can't believe
[SPEAKER_05]: how many people are saying ice cream right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is actually insane to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they thought they had to receive
instead of give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be saying ice cream too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so like, so some of the questions are
like, what's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, so yeah, it's just,
it's really funny because he just asks you
[SPEAKER_05]: these like questions and he doesn't ask
them in a certain order.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's no like, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's not like a gradual thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what's your name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ice cream or anal?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's so back and forth like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So would you just add Chris?
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a turp tail?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's making a video.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I can see it right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think he, the cookies from you guys
at CGC doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you put some of this syringe on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just did this cookies on its own.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I can read them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, some turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: ACDC turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you put on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It smelled amazing when you blew it in my
face.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was probably the ACDC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a mix of everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still smells real good in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a mix of everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was good man.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a little reddish purple now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give him a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I have to say us dabbers are a
breed of our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this solventless stuff called white
crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: White crack OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this stuff smells like some cheese
that has been in a refrigerator with no
[SPEAKER_03]: power for about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: After you had some bad cheese,
you puked it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody makes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I break this stuff up and
people sniff it, their face is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: can I dab it?
[SPEAKER_08]: It smells like poop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I have some?
[SPEAKER_08]: It smells like your butt after a run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just amazing that we want to dab
something that smells so bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take a dab of it just because
I'm brave and I'm very curious what it
[SPEAKER_08]: actually tastes like.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes just like your butt after a run.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's none of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already talked about it,
but it tastes good, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't taste like dog poop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't taste like the cheesy vomit it
smells like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheesy vomit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_08]: I approve though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm high from it too.
[SPEAKER_08]: White crack OG smells like a can of dog
farts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we assume that it's probably green
crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the white is?
[SPEAKER_03]: White widow, the white, the white,
the white probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get me on that rant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that extraction companies do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it should say, uh,
the white and green crack or something on
[SPEAKER_08]: there because that's misleading.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're medical consumers and we'd like to
know what strains we're consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of people that don't
have the knowledge or friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have knowledge because I have
friends like you guys that pass it on to
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody might walk in there they wouldn't
know what the hell that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they want it, maybe, maybe green
crack gives them panic attacks and the
[SPEAKER_08]: white is perfect for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we all know green crack is a
pretty heavy sativa and I'm learning more
[SPEAKER_03]: and more young, but tenders don't really
know what different strains will do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we talk about something that you did
since we've been talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: suppositories?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I heard a rumor, I heard a little
story that you took a gram of distillate
[SPEAKER_08]: and you used it as a suppository.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's so funny is she actually
used green crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what reminded my brain.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in my notes that are on the floor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you put some green crack in your brown
crack and it made you bounce around all
[SPEAKER_08]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a heavy sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I guess for cleaning the house or
something, but it was a little,
[SPEAKER_03]: a little too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not recommend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a pretty high tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm saying I don't recommend maybe
half a gram or, or just use a normal
[SPEAKER_08]: suppository.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bud tender told me to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They told me to jump off the bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was going to go re.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he meant the entire syringe.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I will say about these syringes,
they're good for cooking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to put a little, a little
distillate in your food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like meatballs and spaghetti sauce.
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have some hot cocoa with some
distillate in it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, I have a different way to make hot
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shumit bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see my picture the other day?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made, I had some s'mores hot cocoa made
that it was real and I made it with milk,
[SPEAKER_03]: cold milk, nice and creamy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a 200 milligram Shumit s'mores bar
and graded that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I feel warm and fuzzy inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big dollop of marshmallow cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drank that all, all 200 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I slept really good that night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're made with pure distillate.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_08]: Caleb makes good candy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good candy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, I go through these phases where I do
and don't do edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of our good friends may
have just messed up my edibles cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I was back on the horse.
[SPEAKER_08]: It stays with me for too long.
[SPEAKER_08]: The next day, like I feel really good when
I eat that edibles, but the next day I
[SPEAKER_08]: feel slow motion.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, and I'm a very productive dude and I
can't be dragging ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got them brain locks like,
Oh, I just, I can't think a little bit,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's more, it's more my body.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I'm just, I'm weighed down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I've just got weights on my leg.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much are you eating?
[SPEAKER_08]: Way too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but that was the issue was the two
times that we've eaten too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: First time was your own fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second time we didn't realize how much
that cake was really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, I, yeah, I, is that what made the
car?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was floating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was certainly floating in our defense.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried to do like, you know,
we tried to do smaller slices,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the restaurant was never, they were
super polite.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all have learned that I'm a strict
vegetarian and they put bacon on the cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a specific section of cake
with no bacon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they were super polite about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were courteous and fed me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, I'm going to eat this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was super tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: But by the next morning, when I was still
high, when I woke up, I was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: what the fuck did they put in that thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was TNT extraction center.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's gotten both of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm the plug, not the extension core
Dwayne as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was both of them, Max and Dwayne.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe I met.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not they're always together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you probably have, you probably have,
you probably just, you know, don't realize
[SPEAKER_05]: it, but, or yeah, but yeah, shout out to
them because that cake was superb.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the bacon that they make, well,
you don't know, but the bacon that they
[SPEAKER_05]: make is really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, the hash that they make is super
good too.
[SPEAKER_08]: The hash was delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: They, uh, they know that I don't eat the
bacon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they bring extra concentrates to dab
with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, we brought this for you
buddy, just so that they could kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: make like, we're sorry, we're sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're involved here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what you get.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get bacon.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for you listeners out there,
I know you hear them silly ass rumors
[SPEAKER_03]: about ODN from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to hallucinate.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been trying all night.
[SPEAKER_05]: That reporter goal to OD on weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wants to be the first person to ever OD
on weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to hallucinate from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying so hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're putting it in our butts and it's not
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to, you're going to take a
whole lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to dab a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to do too many, too,
too many suppositories.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to wake up tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have a weed over.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jeff said, going to be hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very little lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's, that's why you'll always
see water with dabbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We always have liquids around caffeine and
water.
[SPEAKER_08]: They keep me alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So contrary to the bullshit you hear on
some of them new shows on TV, you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to overdose on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only way you can die from cannabis is
if a ton of it falls on your head and
[SPEAKER_08]: kills you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's Joe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you're eating a pound in it,
it lodges in your throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but who's going to really,
or if the cops kick in your door and kill
[SPEAKER_08]: you for having it, that would,
that's the problem with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Police are more dangerous than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jello is more dangerous than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, we've been going for an hour and
35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of the longest podcasts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was no reason to stop it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The conference conversation got natural
and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, I'm going to let this keep
going, but you look exhausted over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super quiet and sat back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, Oh, she's got to drive two
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, but no, I was just the only
thought was, well, you guys were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem with them these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so good that you just eat more of
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked on this show that we need to
buy edibles that come with like package A
[SPEAKER_08]: and package B and A is medicated and B is
not so that you can eat one of A and then
[SPEAKER_08]: four or five of B and be all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we find ourselves wrecked at this
table sometimes when it's edibles night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually looking at doing a,
one of our edibles being primarily CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to kind of just for that
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cause you know, again, the edibles
market's already been created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to kind of come in and bring
something out, offer something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a high CBD,
low THC ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know exactly what those are yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those to be announced.
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cannabis industry is always evolving.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love how every week there's something
new.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have, what's the new thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: The high terpene, uh, what's the H T S F E
R Q.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you had it for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: The high terpene, uh, full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the new tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like that sauce kind of, it's where
it separates.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit I got.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris doesn't have a microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys saw what it was, how he explained
it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like trip sauce, but it's potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: He called it and it's super lemon Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's straight sativa to the dome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh hell yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he called it sugar wax without the
sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you tip it, I mean, it's,
it's a liquidy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's not like this terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like evil lab terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What she got is just, she got just the,
the crystals by themselves and then the
[SPEAKER_07]: sauce in its own vial.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she got like just the top layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of, of Terps that just comes off in its
own vial of just like lemony, skunky,
[SPEAKER_07]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's shout him out to Yoshi extracts.
