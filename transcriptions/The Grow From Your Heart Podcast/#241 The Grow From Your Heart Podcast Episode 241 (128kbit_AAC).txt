[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for episode number 241 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_08]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_08]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_08]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_08]: for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_08]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big thanks to Kat, Kude, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I'm starting off
the podcast with the throat thing already.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to blame it on all of the flour
I've been smoking.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you know me and if you listen to the
podcast a lot, you know that I don't smoke
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We call weed the buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's known as flowers in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're in Colorado or a legal state,
that's the flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't smoke a lot of flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to smoke a lot of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to take a lot of dabs, but last
weekend I went to see Phish, and it's hard
[SPEAKER_08]: to sneak a dab rig into a concert,
but you can sneak a whole bunch of joints
[SPEAKER_08]: and a whole bunch of weed into a concert.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been smoking a lot of flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a little bit more convenient
than taking a dab all the time,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you can hear what it's doing to my
throat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to this Lemon OG Haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was bred by the Ethos Collective,
Ethos Seeds, Mr. Colin, and then I grew it
[SPEAKER_08]: at Three Rivers, and then I bought it as a
just a patient over the counter,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I smoked a whole bunch of it this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was freaking delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also smoked a bunch of the True Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: What else did I have?
[SPEAKER_08]: I had some Bordello and some blueberry
headband.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were all quite delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Bordello was a little more mellow than
what I would have preferred, but the
[SPEAKER_08]: flavor was on point.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once again, I apologize for all the
throat clearing that you will hear during
[SPEAKER_08]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it fades away once I start
talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get my voice going.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will fade away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also got some water here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also got some frosty cold Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will keep myself caffeinated,
and hydrated, and I will deliver the best
[SPEAKER_08]: show I can bring you.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I've already been talking about
seeing Phish last weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy crap, you guys, if you know anything
about me, you know that Phish is my
[SPEAKER_08]: favorite band on the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was up for debate for a minute there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might have been Phish or the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_08]: For a moment, it may have been a band
called Moe, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Phish is my favorite band.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I've noticed, you guys,
is I don't know any of the new shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know half of the songs that Phish
plays anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the stuff when they wrote long,
elaborate songs with a lot of great
[SPEAKER_08]: changes, and now it's kind of
straightforward for rock and roll stuff,
[SPEAKER_08]: which I'm not mad about.
[SPEAKER_08]: They put in a lot of work to write all
those other long songs, but a lot of the
[SPEAKER_08]: new stuff isn't for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still had a great time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Phish did, Phish with a pH, did three
nights at Dick's Sporting Goods.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Dick's Sporting Goods Field or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a giant soccer field in Denver.
[SPEAKER_08]: It holds a lot of damn people.
[SPEAKER_08]: This place was huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did three nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, the concerts were great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went with the always lovely,
always beautiful Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_08]: We drove up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a hotel.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went and saw Phish.
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite song of the first night,
I'm not going to read you the entire set
[SPEAKER_08]: list, one of my favorite Phish songs of
all time has always been Tube.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen them play Tube a couple of times
live.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a really cool version of Tube the
first night at the Phish concert.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's always awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, if you know me, you know that I
love Harry Hood.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a reggae style Phish song.
[SPEAKER_08]: They played Harry Hood, and then they
played Harry Hood into Cabern.
[SPEAKER_08]: The old stuff is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I'm mentioning the old songs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cabern is off of one of their first couple
albums that they put out off of A Picture
[SPEAKER_08]: of Nectar.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the one with the quote, whatever you
do, take care of your shoes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a great show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super happy with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They on-chord with The Horse and A Silent
in the Morning into Character Zero.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard them play a little note.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do those little teaser notes.
[SPEAKER_08]: When a musician picks up his guitar,
and he's going to play a song,
[SPEAKER_08]: you put your pedals to your effects pedals
around the right thing, and then you do a
[SPEAKER_08]: little noodling to make sure it sounds
right, and then you play the song.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell by their pre-noodling what song
it was going to be when it was The Horse
[SPEAKER_08]: into Silent in the Morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's always fun calling the songs before
they play them.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the encore was The Horse, Silent in
the Morning, into Character Zero.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the first night.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second night, and I'm going to go
quickly here with my favorites out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: sad list.
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that are Phish fans that listen
to the show will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of you will just get to hear some
of my favorite songs.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second night, they started the show
with Simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always thought that was cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they went into a song that I'm going
to admit it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I've ever fucking heard it
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was called Martian Monster.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I've ever heard that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That might have been my first time ever
hearing that song.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, I don't know any of the new
Phish stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything after Round Room, I'm pretty
lost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before, I don't even know a lot of Round
Room.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where they kind of lost me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that old shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I go to see the jams and the old shit,
and I go to see the buildup, and then when
[SPEAKER_08]: Trey hits that fucking pentacle note,
just whaaa.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a Phish fan, you know what I
mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just goes to this place.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I go for.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second night, they opened with Simple
into Martian Monster.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they did it to me, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_08]: They played fucking Reba.
[SPEAKER_08]: The crowd went wild.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reba is a super popular Phish song.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did it with The Whistle, if you're
wondering.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they did Sand, Limb by Limb in that
set.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then Chalk Dust.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's where it got fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything's Right, Flago, Steam,
Chalk Dust, Torture, Mike's Song,
[SPEAKER_08]: Winter Queen, What's the Use, We Could
Pug, Groove, all as one giant segue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those all into each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Finished up with Slave to the Traffic
Light.
[SPEAKER_08]: Encore was The Lizards and Run Like an
Antelope.
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost read you the whole set list,
but damn, that second set was a fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: heater, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of jamming went on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second night of the show, I actually
sat with Mr. Sean Azzariti and his lovely,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure their official title,
but his partner in crime, his companion
[SPEAKER_08]: for the night, Miss Caroline.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I had the lovely and beautiful
Miss Jenny Beth on my arm.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got some pretty cool seats.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't buy the field seats.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get down on the field.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right in the front, it just gets a little
too crowded.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all fucked up on drugs and they're
not super polite.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that they're rude.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just fucking high out of their
minds and they're not paying attention
[SPEAKER_08]: that they're in your space and spilling
their drink on you and stepping on your
[SPEAKER_08]: toes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a pretty girl with me and I don't
need to deal with all that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We chose to sit in the stands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean happened to be about two rows back
from the stands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Him and Caroline saved us some seats,
so we got to eat some vegan nachos in the
[SPEAKER_08]: parking lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we headed into the fish show for the
second night.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first night, we just kind of floated
around in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the back of Dix, there's an area where
you can just kind of stand there and dance
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's not a lot of people around.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not real crowded.
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoyed that so I could get down and
just shake my dreads and swing my arms
[SPEAKER_08]: around and be a silly hippie for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're 6'5 and your arms are super
long, you just feel like you're always
[SPEAKER_08]: bumping into people at a concert,
so it's kind of nice just to be in the
[SPEAKER_08]: back.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second night, we were kind of in the
crowd and then three quarters of the way
[SPEAKER_08]: through, the people to the right of me
decided they'd had enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were a little older than myself and
they just dipped out.
[SPEAKER_08]: They took off, so I had a lot of space to
the right side of me and I stepped over
[SPEAKER_08]: and gave some other people some room,
but that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll keep going to the third night.
[SPEAKER_08]: They opened with a song I'm not sure I'd
ever heard, Buffalo Bill.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure I've heard it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't sound really familiar, but I knew
the words.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: The moment dance, birds of a feather,
a couple things that I'm not familiar
[SPEAKER_08]: with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back on the train, which is always cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: The wedge was fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: 46 days was not my thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounded good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not my favorite song.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bathtub Gin was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then set two down with disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Meat stick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, the meat stick piper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Into meat stick was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: 2001 possum, Susie Greenberg.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny wanted to hear Susie Greenberg all
weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, I want to hear Susie
Greenberg.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear Susie Greenberg.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking three songs left in the whole
concert.
[SPEAKER_08]: She heard Susie Greenberg.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they wrap up the second set with Susie
Greenberg, come out, do an encore of waste
[SPEAKER_08]: into first tube.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was, oh, and I kept mentioning to
Jenny, I said they did not finish down
[SPEAKER_08]: with disease because there was more of
down with disease that they didn't finish.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a whole nother verse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here I'm looking at the notes to the
set list and it says, so I didn't mention
[SPEAKER_08]: that the third night Jenny and I were kind
of debating on where to sit because it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: huge venue and she kind of wanted to have
a seat because she got pretty burnt out,
[SPEAKER_08]: tired over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just convenient to have a seat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, it was crowded and I
didn't really want to invade anybody's
[SPEAKER_08]: space because it was a little later when
we got in Sunday night and most of the
[SPEAKER_08]: good seats were taken.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was okay with just dancing like a
hippie in the aisles and shit is what I
[SPEAKER_08]: do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially at Dick's, they got that
big whole ring area around there that you
[SPEAKER_08]: could just chill in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, how about we just go smoke
a couple of joints off to the side because
[SPEAKER_08]: there's some seats down by the stage that
you can't really see the stage,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you can hear the music.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounded fucking great.
[SPEAKER_08]: We smoked a joint during the opener,
during down with disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we went up to the top and just
walked around and started at the top and
[SPEAKER_08]: worked our way almost all the way around
the bowl.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then just worked our way back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to one end and smoked the joint
and went to the other end and smoked a
[SPEAKER_08]: joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just walked around the whole third
night and just went and grabbed seats
[SPEAKER_08]: during the break.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or when we wanted to go sneak away and
smoke a joint or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just walked around mostly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was kind of cool because we got
to see a lot of different weirdos.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fish shows are filled with weirdos.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also got to see the concert from a
lot of different angles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I got to walk around and enjoy it
the way I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Jenny also got to have a seat and
rest her bones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Her knee was getting a little sore,
which is understandable.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, that was our seating
arrangement on the third night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about some of my favorites,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of my favorite songs over the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, Tube was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rebo was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Limb by Limb was really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Contact is always one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason, The Horse into Silent in
the Morning is not particularly one of my
[SPEAKER_08]: favorite fish songs.
[SPEAKER_08]: But hearing it live, the way that they did
it was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_08]: So good job, Fish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had a great fucking weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being a great fish date,
a weekend date.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a fun little getaway with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had a great time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I want to mention something.
[SPEAKER_08]: One night at the Fish concert,
I was in line getting some lemonade.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was probably the third night,
I would assume.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't completely remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it was the third night,
because we were way off to the left over
[SPEAKER_08]: there getting a lemonade.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had to be the third night, because that's
where we kept smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in that one seat over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they didn't even, I just had so
much, so many joints on me and they didn't
[SPEAKER_08]: even search me to find one of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had joints in every pocket.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was rolling joints and filling them with
wax and filling them with butter,
[SPEAKER_08]: with batters, with hashes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, the third night, I was in line
for lemonade, the non-alcoholic lemonade.
[SPEAKER_08]: They cost $6.50.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically a cup of ice water.
[SPEAKER_08]: They drop a fucking lemon in it and charge
you $6.50.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever, it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was refreshing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I met a lovely young lady who,
at first I wrote down Ashley, and then I
[SPEAKER_08]: second-guessed myself in her sit and said,
her name is Amber.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go with my first intuition
and say that I met a lady named Ashley.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't want to be wrong, because that
feels fucking rude.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure it was Ashley or Amber.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Fish concert, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did just get done smoking a gigantic
joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I was getting lemonade.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I apologize if I got your name wrong,
but she recognized me.
[SPEAKER_08]: She didn't recognize me.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's never seen me before.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wearing an irie genetics t-shirt and
I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've talked about it on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've talked about being at Fish.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she just turned around and she said,
hey, I don't mean to be weird,
[SPEAKER_08]: but are you Rasta Jeff from the podcast?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, that's totally me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she introduced herself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously I was too fucking high to
pay proper attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did my best.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got some ADD, but she's from the East
coast and she's trying to grow on the East
[SPEAKER_08]: coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she had some questions about how to
mimic barometric pressure because she's
[SPEAKER_08]: struggling with pressure and moisture
issues because everything is so different
[SPEAKER_08]: from growing out there to here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And her teacher has left her.
[SPEAKER_08]: She is not with her teacher anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Her teacher has moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: So she's struggling to figure out some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anybody's got any tips on how to
mimic barometric pressure, I would love to
[SPEAKER_08]: hear about that because I have no idea how
to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I had a great conversation with her.
[SPEAKER_08]: We hung out in line for a few minutes
until it was her turn to order her drink.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my turn to order my drink.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then of course, Ms. Jenny Beth came
back from using the restroom.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to introduce her also.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was funny cause we were standing in
line trying to talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for some reason people decided that
the space between her and I, between
[SPEAKER_08]: Ashley slash Amber slash my new friend,
they decided that the space between us was
[SPEAKER_08]: the new walkway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were trying to talk politely and
have a conversation and people just kept
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking passing through like we didn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found it entertaining.
[SPEAKER_08]: But she had some great questions and it
was really great meeting somebody at a
[SPEAKER_08]: fish concert.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were thousands of people there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how many, I'm going to say
10,000 people there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this young lady recognized me and was
polite enough to say hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that made my day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really fun getting a compliment and
meeting a podcast listener randomly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize if I flubbed your name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you understand it was a fish
concert.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what would be really cool is if
you sent me an email or a contact me on
[SPEAKER_08]: social media and let me know if I got your
name right or wrong or anywhere near.
[SPEAKER_08]: What it actually is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go with Ashley because that's
what I, what's what my brain said at
[SPEAKER_08]: first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I was like, no, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I second guessed myself and said
Amber, but I'm going with Ashley.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I want to go with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amber Ashley, let me know how close or how
wrong I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to know about the gift I gave
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I gave you a gift.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Has it happened yet?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So after the fish concert, the fish
concert was great.
[SPEAKER_08]: After the fish concert Sunday,
the lovely Jenny Beth and I headed back to
[SPEAKER_08]: the hotel and slept like babies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we were worn out from a long fish
weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we had a ton of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were exhausted from running around in
the sun and dancing all night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we woke up, we got cleaned up,
packed up from the hotel and we headed to
[SPEAKER_08]: a restaurant known as Sam's number three,
delicious little fucking eat spot right
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marvelous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd recommend that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we went hung out at the guitar center
in Denver for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the one on Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just went and beat around on some
electronic drums for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had some time to kill and we were
right near that area.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just went and knocked around on some
drums and then we headed over to comedy
[SPEAKER_08]: works where I got dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got super blazed and Miss Jenny got
super blazed as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we went to comedy works and we saw Mr.
Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug Benson was doing standup comedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the time when I go see Doug,
he's doing his own podcast, which is
[SPEAKER_08]: called Doug loves movies, which is
hilarious where he's usually got a few
[SPEAKER_08]: guests and they play some games on stage
and people win prizes and things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of interactive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: This show, however, was just to stand up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it was kind of a weird setup,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: They introduced Doug and he came out and
did a little talking and then,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, he went, he said, so I'm the host.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now I want to bring out my opening act,
Jacob Siroff and Jacob Siroff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope I'm saying that right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Siroff, Siroff, Siroff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jacob Siroff came out and did like 35,
45 solid minutes of fucking crushing
[SPEAKER_08]: material.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, if you want to be slightly
offended, no matter who you are,
[SPEAKER_08]: no matter what race you are, what sexual
orientation, what religion, Jacob Siroff
[SPEAKER_08]: has got something to offend you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like that kind of humor,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So check him out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jacob Siroff, S I R O F.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, check him out.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he's a little Jewish guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's kind of got, um, man, I don't want to
contaminate your thought process when you
[SPEAKER_08]: see him or listen to him, but it's if,
uh, if Ari Shafir and Mark Maron made a
[SPEAKER_08]: baby, it would be Jacob Siroff.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of, that's kind of what I
thought when I met him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so I went and saw Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the way to see Doug Benson,
I decided to listen to the Doug Loves
[SPEAKER_08]: Minis podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: A few minutes into the podcast,
he's like, Denver, I'm coming to see
[SPEAKER_08]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no, no, he actually read my iTunes
review and Doug Benson said, take a fat
[SPEAKER_08]: dab and give your mom a hug for me at the
end of my iTunes review, because I was
[SPEAKER_08]: smart enough to type that in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he reads the iTunes reviews on his
show.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then after he read my iTunes review,
he's like, Rasta Jeff, I'm going to Denver
[SPEAKER_08]: and I look forward to seeing Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: He comes to all the shows.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be fun to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: See him there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He totally gave me like a long shout on
his podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was super cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, uh, we were at comedy works at the
show and Doug Benson reads tweets.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if you tweet him before the show,
he will read your tweet possibly during
[SPEAKER_08]: the opening part of the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he read my tweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course I said, uh, at Doug Benson,
I'm getting, I don't remember the words I
[SPEAKER_08]: used.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have my Twitter open right now,
but I said, I'm getting lit up on dabs and
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Pepper before the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he read, he asked me, he goes,
Rasta Jeff's here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, woohoo, I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_08]: How many shows have you been to?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I couldn't think of how many Doug
Benson shows I've actually been to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said about 10, but honestly,
I said more than 10.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I think I've been to closer to
20 Doug Benson performances, all of which
[SPEAKER_08]: were at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he read my tweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: He asked me some questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: He told me, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he said it was our 10th anniversary,
which means the gift is paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he said, I'm sure Rasta Jeff has
something wrapped in paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he laughed and he said,
I look forward to seeing the outside dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, because he met in the alley where we
smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he goes, I'm going to give you a
fucking, you can't believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Doug Benson told me he was going to
give me a fucking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he just started laughing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he said, no, I'll see you out in
the alley after you show.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he said, me and all my friends
are going to jump you and wash your hair,
[SPEAKER_08]: which was slightly offensive, but
completely funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, uh, of course Ms. Jenny Beth
tweeted at Doug Benson also.
[SPEAKER_08]: So right after that, he said, where's Ms.
And I'm not going to say her Twitter
[SPEAKER_08]: handle because I don't know if she wants
it advertised like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, babe.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you wanted me to say it, I'll say it on
another show, but she did not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if she wants her.
[SPEAKER_08]: She didn't give me permission or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's Doug Benson's like, so where's
this person?
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's like, Ooh, I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was pretty embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he read her tweet, which was
something about seeing Doug Benson after a
[SPEAKER_08]: great weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, babe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was saying thanks, babe,
to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause she tagged me in the post,
but Doug Benson was like, so is that for
[SPEAKER_08]: me, babe?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we both got our tweets read by Doug
Benson during his recording, Doug Benson
[SPEAKER_08]: revealed that the show at comedy works was
being recorded for his next comedy album
[SPEAKER_08]: that he will release on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a good chance that myself and
the always lovely, always beautiful,
[SPEAKER_08]: always charming Ms. Jenny Beth will be on
Doug Benson's new recording because his
[SPEAKER_08]: new thing that he's doing, uh,
he just records the entire show and then
[SPEAKER_08]: puts it out like a bootleg style,
like how fish used to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the name of the show will be the date,
which was, I believe September 4th.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be nine slash four slash 17 Denver,
Colorado will be the name of the album.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope he puts it out because I mean,
I got a lot of fucking interaction and it
[SPEAKER_08]: would be really cool to get to listen back
to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the live album should come out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully that happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if the album doesn't come out,
uh, I always have a good time when Doug
[SPEAKER_08]: Benson comes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a huge shout out to Doug
Benson.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think he listens to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I listened to three of his five podcasts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's five, let's see getting
Doug with high Doug loves movies,
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug loves minis dining with Doug and
Karen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there's the premium content,
premium content on iTunes that I do not
[SPEAKER_08]: pay for.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there's also premium content on
Stitcher that I do not pay for.
[SPEAKER_08]: That may sound crazy, but there's so much
fucking free podcasting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would I pay to listen to a podcast?
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it's my buddy, Doug Benson,
there's no need to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't listen to it if I did pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause there's so much goddamn content.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, Joe Rogan's putting out fucking
nine hours a week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to pay for something,
but anyway, uh, Doug Benson puts out a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of content.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think he listens to my show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I listened to most of his, but anyway,
huge shout out to Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_08]: He always treats me, uh, just like a
normal dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're buddies by now.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: When he sees me, he interacts with me and
just like we've hung out a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also huge, huge shout out to Jacob Seroff.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dude was funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he hung out with us after the show,
took pics with, uh, Jenny Beth and I
[SPEAKER_08]: smoked some joints with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also always, always want to give a huge
shout out to my friends at comedy works in
[SPEAKER_08]: downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, shout out to the entire staff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody there takes good care of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know a lot of their names.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there are a lot of them and
there's one of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a few of their names, but everybody
there takes great care of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it from the guy at the front
bar to the guy at the second bar,
[SPEAKER_08]: to the ticket taker, to the guy that at
the ticket booth, it gives you your
[SPEAKER_08]: tickets to all of the people that seat
you, that bring you drinks to the sound
[SPEAKER_08]: guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody there always treats me like
fucking royalty, like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't show them enough love.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're ever in Denver, go catch a
comedy show at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if it's not a big name act,
just go.
[SPEAKER_08]: See some comedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some rules when you see comedy
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me, let me educate you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's one rule when you see comedy,
shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not on stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing you're there to do is laugh
your ass off.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't interrupt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't interact.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's some jokes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only rules for comedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't heckle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Comedy works will kick you the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, if you heckle and interrupt and
be a dick, comedy works will make you
[SPEAKER_08]: leave.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go see some comedy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love comedy and also I want to give a
shout out to my friend Baker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Baker, you take good care of me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, since I'm at it, gigantic huge shout
out to Miss Jenny Beth for a great fish
[SPEAKER_08]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a perfect fish date.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're like 20 minutes into this and I
haven't talked about cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: All I've talked about is smoking cannabis,
but if you'll notice my throat has quit
[SPEAKER_08]: doing that thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take a little drink right
here and moisten myself up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fucking deliciously refreshing.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to shift gears and talk about
something a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: More serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't use any names because of,
uh, I don't have permission and I try to
[SPEAKER_08]: be respectful, but I had something weird
happen while I was at work the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my, I'm the boss and it sounds
weird to say employees.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my employees and that's how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just doesn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause he's my friend also, and I don't
like power trip and being the boss.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's equal to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just got the title of I get the
fucking to-do list and spread it out and
[SPEAKER_08]: he does the shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyhow, one of my employees applied
pest pesticides and he assured me that he
[SPEAKER_08]: used all of the proper protective
equipment and that he took all of the
[SPEAKER_08]: proper safety procedures and steps and
that he followed the standard operation
[SPEAKER_08]: procedure to a T, which I know he does
because he's a great employee.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he's dedicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's smart.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's aware.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's just that guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's also been worker protection
safety trained.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know what he's doing, or I know that
he knows what he's doing and he knows the
[SPEAKER_08]: risks involved with what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my employee applied a pesticide to a
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually applied.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, you can mix pesticides if
they're compatible.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to spray one thing at a
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, you can put like evergreen and maybe,
uh, I don't want to tell you too many
[SPEAKER_08]: trade secrets, but you can put evergreen
and cease in the same container and you
[SPEAKER_08]: can shake the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put them in there with water, uh,
like 15 to 30 mils of evergreen and like
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 to 45 milliliters of cease and just
spray that shit on your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can mix shit, but we do, we'll do
multiple products at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we've got a new product that we've
only used a couple of times, and this
[SPEAKER_08]: employee has never applied this product
before.
[SPEAKER_08]: He did everything correctly.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, at some point he mentioned that
he did get a couple of drops of this
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide on his wrist area.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said he immediately removed his
glove because it got past the glove.
[SPEAKER_08]: It got higher than the glove went.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he removed his glove.
[SPEAKER_08]: He went to the sink area and he washed his
hand for a few minutes as directed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he went back and put on his gloves.
[SPEAKER_08]: He dried himself off, went black,
put on his gloves and applied the
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide as planned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he was okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Later on that evening, his hand was
turning a little bit red and it didn't
[SPEAKER_08]: bother him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he sprayed around 3 PM around 10 30
that night.
[SPEAKER_08]: He sent me a text message saying,
Hey, I'm having an allergic reaction to
[SPEAKER_08]: that spray.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he sent me a picture of his leg with
welts growing on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked, it looked like he had just
welts all over his thigh area.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was red and funky.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a little concerning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, dude, we have to address
this first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 10 30 at night.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was nothing I could do about it at
the time other than tell him, go to the
[SPEAKER_08]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you feel that's what you need to do,
because as his friend and his boss and his
[SPEAKER_08]: coworker and someone that just cares about
him in general, I was like, dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you need to go to the hospital,
go, your job is safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we're not mad at you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go take care of you because that's what
matters.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's like, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't itch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see you in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: He showed up the next morning at eight o
'clock and I'm like, let me see that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're okay to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I don't need him there working if
he's not in good shape.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I need him to go to the doctor so that
we can prevent liabilities and get my
[SPEAKER_08]: friend safe again and healthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I make him pull up his shirt and show
me like, cause he had, he said that it was
[SPEAKER_08]: on his rib cage last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, let me see your ribs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And his ribs are cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, let me see your thighs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thighs were cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Arms were cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, all right, I'll let you work,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we worked throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything was fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything was totally fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: We go to lunch at noon.
[SPEAKER_08]: We come back at one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_08]: He starts working around two o'clock.
[SPEAKER_08]: He approaches me and he said, Hey boss,
look, it's coming back.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got little welts on his arms that
aren't significant, but you can see
[SPEAKER_08]: something's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, we've got to keep an eye on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it gets any worse, you're going to the
doctor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, shit, I don't want to go to
the doctor, which is understandable.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys within probably 30 minutes of
this conversation, he came back to me and
[SPEAKER_08]: he said, boss, I got to go to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_08]: This dude had welts on his rib cage area
that looked like I had whipped this shit
[SPEAKER_08]: out of him with a whip for hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: These welts came out of nowhere and
covered his rib cage area on both sides.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had welts on his thighs.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had welts on his forearms.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's brown.
[SPEAKER_08]: His skin is brown.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not being racist.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a very brown complexion.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a brown person.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got black hair, fucking brown skin.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was red.
[SPEAKER_08]: His skin was visibly red.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could see that his face was red.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, bro, we got to take you to
the hospital.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I grabbed all of the labels off of all
of the bottles that he had used and put
[SPEAKER_08]: them in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we drove to the hospital with those
labels.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had to tell the hospital that my
friend had been exposed to pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it was really funny because they're
like, what are you here for?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their instant reaction was to freak out.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were like, did you bring it in here?
[SPEAKER_08]: How long ago did you change clothes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you wearing the same clothes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you shower?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, my buddy was kind of,
before that, when they're checking in,
[SPEAKER_08]: they asked him, they asked him like
height, weight, birthday, address,
[SPEAKER_08]: name, phone number.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they said, do you feel safe at
home?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_08]: And the nurse laughed.
[SPEAKER_08]: She goes, do you feel safe at home?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she explained that they have to ask
that because that may be some person's
[SPEAKER_08]: only opportunity to say no.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't ever laugh at them when they ask
you that fucking question because there
[SPEAKER_08]: may be one person that says, no,
I need some fucking help.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's scary at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone's doing shit to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what that's for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't laugh.
[SPEAKER_08]: But my buddy was thrown off by that
question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to kind of interrupt and explain.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, dude, this happened yesterday
at 320.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friend went home.
[SPEAKER_08]: He changed clothes immediately.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's taken two or three showers since
then.
[SPEAKER_08]: He came to work and worked all day and
hasn't been near that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was off on the day that the application
happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been near the pesticide or the
applied room at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, all this shit happened
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they all took a big breath and calmed
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, ah, we're about to put you
guys in the decontamination shower.
[SPEAKER_08]: So me and my buddy were about to get a
shower together, it sounded like,
[SPEAKER_08]: which would have been super awkward.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were going to get thrown in the
decontamination unit, which would have
[SPEAKER_08]: been really a longer story than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this would have been a lot more
expensive of a bill than what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily I was able to speak up and tell
him that wasn't necessary.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they ended up telling my friend that it
was certainly an allergic reaction to the
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, and my friend kept saying,
but I didn't get it on my legs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they explained, you don't have to get
it on your legs.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stuff you got on you, your body is
allergic to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a reaction.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's trying to move that reaction around
your body to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he got these weird hives all over
himself.
[SPEAKER_08]: These welts, these hive looking things all
over his body.
[SPEAKER_08]: They told him to take a couple of Benadryl
and take Benadryl every time it started
[SPEAKER_08]: flaring up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said it was starting to itch real
bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could see him trying not to scratch
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also gave him a steroid shot and
said the steroid shot would speed it up
[SPEAKER_08]: and help his body heal and recover from
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I gave him the next day off.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got three days off in a row right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I called him today.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been, he had a full day without me
bugging him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I called him today and he said that
he feels just fine, that it flares up
[SPEAKER_08]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it itches when he does, but he takes a
Benadryl and it goes away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's doing much better.
[SPEAKER_08]: So by now I'm sure a lot of people are
going, why is Jeff telling us about his
[SPEAKER_08]: friend fucking up with a pesticide?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you this because my friend got
drops of a pesticide on himself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few drops.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see where the drops landed on his
skin and left little marks.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see how much, you can actually see
how much shit landed on him because it
[SPEAKER_08]: gave him a tattoo.
[SPEAKER_08]: It changed his skin color right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's back now, but it temporarily changed
his skin color and it messed up his whole
[SPEAKER_08]: body.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gave him a fever.
[SPEAKER_08]: It made him itchy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gave him welts and these weird bumps
all over himself, these hive like bumps,
[SPEAKER_08]: and he wanted to scratch them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel that if he would have scratched
them, he would have ripped something open
[SPEAKER_08]: and he would have been bleeding and gotten
himself infected just by how bad they
[SPEAKER_08]: looked.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason I'm telling you guys this is
because I want you to be more careful when
[SPEAKER_08]: applying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of us, myself included, we've talked
about this at the girl we've all gotten.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody that grows that's been doing
this for a long time has all gotten a
[SPEAKER_08]: little lackadaisical, maybe the word.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are a little complacent when it comes
to applying pesticides and or being around
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I did a podcast a while back about
pesticide safety and pesticide training.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all had that training at my grow
several times and something still
[SPEAKER_08]: happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want you guys to be careful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the next thing I want you to do is
think about what you're going to do if you
[SPEAKER_08]: do have a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_08]: Problem, if you're exposed to something
and you've got an emergency, what are you
[SPEAKER_08]: going to do to help yourself?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there somebody you can call?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there somebody at home with you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you fucked?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an illegal grow?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're running an illegal grow and you
apply a pesticide and let's, I don't want
[SPEAKER_08]: anything bad to happen to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want anything bad to happen to my
coworker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may have said his name, so I have to
fucking listen back to this whole thing
[SPEAKER_08]: and make sure I didn't say anything,
say my buddy's name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want anything to happen to him,
but it did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And luckily, I have a support team that I
can reach out to and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_08]: bad shit happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need guidance.
[SPEAKER_08]: They gave me step-by-step instruction on
how to handle this for my coworker's
[SPEAKER_08]: safety, for my safety and for the
company's safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may not have that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So think about what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just say you're spraying,
you got your pump sprayer.
[SPEAKER_08]: However you apply your pesticide,
it's probably in some sort of a pump
[SPEAKER_08]: sprayer.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're pumping it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something ruptures.
[SPEAKER_08]: That fucker explodes and pesticide goes,
I don't want it in your eye.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's not even go that extreme.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just get pesticide up the side of your
face.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it on your cheek.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of dripping down your neck.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's enough to make you go off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got a bunch of evergreen on my
neck.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a plan?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to freak out?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got an illegal grow and you've
got to go to the hospital for this,
[SPEAKER_08]: you need a reason to be spraying
evergreen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't spray it on my weed plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So think about all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have the number for poison control handy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a regional number.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to give you the wrong number.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just Google poison control on your phone
and you will have the right number.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one number you can call and they
transfer you to the correct region is
[SPEAKER_08]: actually what happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: So have the poison control phone number on
your phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got an advanced phone,
you can talk into it and you can say,
[SPEAKER_08]: call poison control.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you need help, your phone,
Siri will call poison control for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can give you advice on what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be afraid to call 911 if you've got
pesticides in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to need help.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to call 911.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wear some goggles.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as you pick that bottle up,
you should have goggles on because maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: the lid's not put on and you go to shake
it and that shit flies in your eye.
[SPEAKER_08]: You haven't even applied it yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: You haven't poured it yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've already fucked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You needed goggles then.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the goggles early.
[SPEAKER_08]: So know what you're going to do if you do
have a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need most pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't speak for every pesticide.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get it on your skin, the thing you
need to do is rinse that area for 15
[SPEAKER_08]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just rinse that area for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got some antibacterial soap,
scrub that shit on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that pesticide off of your skin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's better to rinse too much and wash too
heavily than just to be lazy and leave
[SPEAKER_08]: some on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So get in there and rinse that shit off.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you see anything like a welt or
anything like your skin raising or turning
[SPEAKER_08]: white or changing colors, maybe consider
going to the hospital and getting looked
[SPEAKER_08]: at.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: But your health is priceless.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily my coworker was able to take some
Benadryls and get a shot.
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't have anything too serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please don't put yourself in my coworker's
position.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I've been ranting about this for a
long time, but it was scary.
[SPEAKER_08]: My buddy was already fucked up from
pesticides and then I was watching him
[SPEAKER_08]: just have a fucking nervous breakdown
because he was so scared of what he may
[SPEAKER_08]: have done to his body and what may happen
to him at the hospital.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not a fun experience for anybody
and it was quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily, it'll be covered because we have
a great company, Workman's Comp handles
[SPEAKER_08]: that sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if that was you at home and you had to
pay for it out of pocket or through your
[SPEAKER_08]: insurance, you're going to have some
splaining to do and it's going to get
[SPEAKER_08]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to say it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you fuck up with pesticides,
have a plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Know what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to clean yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to get the clothes off of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's on your clothes, you need to
shower.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you feel like you need medical
attention, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always best to have somebody around
when you're applying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always use the proper equipment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Goggles.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: From the minute you put the goggles on,
then pick up the pesticide bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have gloves on.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least those six millimeter thick
nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least wear those.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to wear something 12
millimeters thick when you're handling a
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the pesticides need something
thicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wear those thicker gloves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wear pants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely cover your fucking feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure that your feet are covered.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the pesticides are going to fall to
the ground and you're going to walk in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bottoms of your feet are some of the
most absorbive absorb.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know the proper word.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bottoms of your feet absorb a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're able to, it's the most
absorption-y.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pick a word right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It absorbs the most.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bottom of your feet, your genitals,
your eyes and your mouth, your palms.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where you can absorb a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't go walking around in pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cover up your feet if you're applying
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always, always, always follow the reentry
interval rules on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on every bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, here's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got a home grow, if you've got
an indoor grow and you don't have major
[SPEAKER_08]: air circulation, you need to give extra
time for what's called a ventilation
[SPEAKER_08]: period.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you apply a pesticide in a room,
it becomes basically a vapor.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're using a paint sprayer or a pump
sprayer, you've turned it into little
[SPEAKER_08]: vapors and it's floating around the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to allow two hours for a
ventilation period for that vapor to
[SPEAKER_08]: dissipate and become, to land essentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to land.
[SPEAKER_08]: That fog in the room needs to go away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got a two-hour ventilation
period before your reentry interval
[SPEAKER_08]: starts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of the products we're using have
a four, an eight, a 12.
[SPEAKER_08]: None of them should have a 24-hour reentry
interval.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it does, you're using some major shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may want to reconsider that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But follow those rules carefully and wear
your personal protective equipment if you
[SPEAKER_08]: have to go in there early.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, you guys, I've seen very minor
effects of things going wrong with
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides and it was a scary situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want it to happen to anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want it to happen to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want you to be safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I would recommend is before you
apply a pesticide, read what to do should
[SPEAKER_08]: you fuck up so that you don't have to be
struggling, panicking, having a freak out,
[SPEAKER_08]: possibly have shit in your eyes,
and then trying to read a bottle to figure
[SPEAKER_08]: out what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Read it before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, should you need to go to the
hospital, I don't want you to have to,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you may have to, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: This shit comes up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to take a good friend to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have to go to the hospital,
take the labels off of the bottles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't take them too far into the hospital
before you tell somebody what you've got
[SPEAKER_08]: because they're going to want to put it in
a safe container so you don't spread any
[SPEAKER_08]: of that pesticide around the hospital.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can, if time allows, take a shower
and change your clothes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you were wearing when you applied
pesticides, take it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rinse your body thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put on fresh clothes that aren't
contaminated with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then go to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way you don't contaminate the
hospital with pesticides also.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't contaminate the people that help
you, the doctor, the nurse, the triage
[SPEAKER_08]: nurse, the lady at check-in, the security
guard that takes your knife from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't contaminate them with
pesticides also.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay attention to pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: I encourage everybody to read all of the
labeling on all of the pesticides you were
[SPEAKER_08]: using.
[SPEAKER_08]: I encourage you to use all of the proper
equipment that you need for all of those
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not take any of it lightly and please
be careful with the pesticides you're
[SPEAKER_08]: using outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not fuck up our environment so that you
can grow some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not worth it that all of the land is
not yours.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just that one plot that you're growing on
and that spray that you're spraying is
[SPEAKER_08]: affecting the entire world and it's not
fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: So please be respectful if you're spraying
pesticides outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter what you're doing with the
pesticide, please be careful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please respect the shit in that bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I've been fucking giving you
guys a lecture for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna stop doing that for right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been going for close to 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have a couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got two emails about the same topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're both about getting into the
cannabis industry and folks moving to
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got one person coming from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got another person coming from Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually hope they are both okay since
we've got a fucking tremendous hurricane
[SPEAKER_08]: down there whipping everybody's ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're able to listen to this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you and your families are safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually hope everybody down in the
south is safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope everybody in the west is safe from
the fires.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone in the south is safe from the
floods.
[SPEAKER_08]: I send fucking love and light to everybody
in times of struggles right now because of
[SPEAKER_08]: natural disasters or whatever type of
disaster you've got in your life.
[SPEAKER_08]: I fucking send you some jaw love.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I was saying was I'm gonna read
some emails on the next episode from folks
[SPEAKER_08]: from down south.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're both coming to Colorado or looking
to come to Colorado to get into the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll talk about how to guide them into
doing that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to send me an email to read
on a future episode, I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_08]: from you.

me to review or if you'd like to sponsor
[SPEAKER_08]: the podcast, you can contact me through

[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of product reviews, I do have a
box from my friends at PL Grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: They sent me a great product to try out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been away on vacation seeing fish.
[SPEAKER_08]: I came back from seeing fish to find out
that my coworker had a pesticide problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then today I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully over the weekend I am able to
set up the device that they sent me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play around with that over the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get it set up and running for the
week and then hopefully within the next
[SPEAKER_08]: few weeks I'll be able to give you guys a
full report and a full review and I'll be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to report back to my friends at PL
Grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they're looking forward to all of
my words.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you guys can tell my voice is
starting to burn out.

[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys are enjoying the Throwback
Thursday episodes that I'm making.
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost every Thursday I put out a long
block of old episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: My reason for doing so is because on
iTunes and Stitcher those feeds only hold
[SPEAKER_08]: 100 episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means that the most recent 100 shows
are there and all the old shit falls right
[SPEAKER_08]: out of the feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been making long blocks of
episodes to make those good episodes
[SPEAKER_08]: available once again so new listeners can
go back and hear old content.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once I get caught up, I'll stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The good part is I'm putting old episodes
up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube will not limit how many shows I've
got.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you check out YouTube, search for
the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[SPEAKER_08]: you will find I think there are
approximately 75 to 80 videos up on
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do plan on making more.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just is time consuming and I'm a
hardworking young man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't have a lot of time to sit here
and make YouTube videos but I'll get them
[SPEAKER_08]: up so that you can enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, I think you can hear
my voice cutting out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's starting to go so it is time to wrap
up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a huge shout out to Big
John.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got your email and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also want to give a huge shout out
to everybody who is volunteering time to
[SPEAKER_08]: go rescue people from floods, volunteering
to go put out fires.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you guys also.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more people like you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see you
[SPEAKER_05]: in the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Rasta Jeff, let's not drag my
mom into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll see you soon, I assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ass-ium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
