[SPEAKER_03]: that music you just heard was by our
friend thanks for nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks and big shout out for the
perfect podcast intro tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the right tempo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a great vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really digging the feel of that for
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that one may stick around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will play more musical submissions as
the episodes progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to stay on track on this episode
because I have got a lot of ground to
[SPEAKER_03]: cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like to start the show by talking
about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am still smoking through this jar of
garlic Grove live batter from green dot
[SPEAKER_03]: labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it is a blend of GMO cookies and
LOA F two on the package.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor is described as general.
[SPEAKER_03]: So garlic and orange soda.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I completely agree with that on the
last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also mentioned that this should have a
warning label on it that it has got a
[SPEAKER_03]: punch in the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a Jack in the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like when I unscrew this lid,
just a fist should come out and just punch
[SPEAKER_03]: me right in the face, but also give me a
hug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the most pleasant punch in the
face you could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've got the jar open.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you a beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way the light shines and
reflects off of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of sheen, a little shimmer,
a really delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is like a, a thick cheesecake batter or
maybe a real thick butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really digging the texture and flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And consistency of this, it dabs very
nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously it's got me nice and rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get another jar of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to visit the dispensary to get some
supplies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one does have a potency label on the
back of this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says it contains 68.24% THC and
non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to our friends at green dot
labs for the tremendous garlic Grove live
[SPEAKER_03]: batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the part of the show where we do a
shout out to our friends in this seven 10
[SPEAKER_03]: club.
[SPEAKER_03]: How appropriate.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the seven 10 episode, big dab,
big fist bump to everybody in the seven 10
[SPEAKER_03]: club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the folks who support us on
Patreon at the seven 10 level or above.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off giving a shout out to the
seven 10 club with the captain and
[SPEAKER_03]: commander of the seven 10 club.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a big thank you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my buddy, lemur priest,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at you straight in the face,
giving you a big thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much respect.

same name as one of my favorite drummers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get points in my book for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also today I had the honor of meeting
giant Mike and the dabbing queen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cool people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to spend a couple of moments with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We properly socially distance allegedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to meet you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we hang out in the future when all
the social distancing and stuff is cleaned
[SPEAKER_03]: up and we can hang out and actually take
some dabs and spend more than a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hanging out, just meeting each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, it was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look forward to next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to giant Mike and the dabbing
queen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move forward with the big giant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Kurt Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kurt, I know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all the continued support.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you out there, bro.

all of my working friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people may be driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may be in the cubicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may be even in the garden working

[SPEAKER_03]: Can't really go type patreon.com a whole
bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is open up the podcast

[SPEAKER_03]: I'll stop smacking the microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll all be friends forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys contributed heavily to making
today's episode a success and possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a large plethora of concentrates
on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was probably paid for by Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that I would have gone and
done this if I didn't get a very generous
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon contribution at the start of the
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that helped you guys out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to use that funding toward the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it paid off immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a plethora of concentrates here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to go through each jar or at
least most of the jars and I will post a
[SPEAKER_03]: picture of this table on the Grow From
Your Heart podcast Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to write that down to remember
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to do it as I'm editing the show,
but post IG to IG.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a better note.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know what that means, but then you
can see what this table looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is beautiful chaos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, four, six, eight, 10, 12,
14, 15, 16, 17, 17 jars, but many of them
[SPEAKER_03]: are four gram jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got a 10 gram jar of
turpsos here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a nice collection of concentrates
on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to top off that with a
whole bunch of equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about rigs and dabbers,
maybe a little bit of evolution of
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment, but let me keep myself on track
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the 710 episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode will come out on 7-9.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is close enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll dab at 7-9.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dabbing every day, but 7-10 is
officially dab day, dab time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take a dab whenever you want guys,
but let's talk about what is 7-10.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does 7-10 mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I celebrating 7-10?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I excited about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: In short, 7-10 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that dreadlock hair sneaking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to tuck that one back in there for
the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: 7-10 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you look at the number 7-10,
write the number 7-10 on a piece of paper
[SPEAKER_03]: and turn it upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we do at 7-10?
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of oil?
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke hash oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of hash oil?
[SPEAKER_03]: Butane, honey oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: B-H-O.
[SPEAKER_03]: Butane processed honey oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go too far, but in this
episode, I'm not going to teach you how to
[SPEAKER_03]: make concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not something I will cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a concentrate consumer, a concentrate
connoisseur, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to talk too much about
making it, but butane honey oil is made
[SPEAKER_03]: with butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that sounds dangerous if you don't
know a lot about the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: The butane is easily removed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We figured out systems to remove the
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk more about that, but butane
honey oil is what B-H-O stands for.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the oil in 7-10 comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: You turn 7-10 upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're smoking butane honey oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: B-H-O.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've seen B-H-O around those letters,
some of this may be old info for some of
[SPEAKER_03]: you, but I want to start at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do the evolution here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is page one of the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got B-H-O.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're smoking butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the oil in 7-10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really believe that the phrase 7-10 was
coined by Task Rock of highly educated
[SPEAKER_03]: titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give Task most of the credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he was on a chat with other folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the guy from Healthstone Glass
was in there, and I'm not sure who else.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were in there, please send me a
message.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you some credit for being in the
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've heard the story from Task and him
and another guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe other guys were in a chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to upgrade 4-20.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, bro, we've moved on from
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're smoking oil all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's come up with a new word.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Task was like 7-10, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 7-10 became the new 4-20.
[SPEAKER_03]: At 4-20, all the stoners like to pack a
bowl and smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke a bowl at 4-20.
[SPEAKER_03]: Celebrate 4-20 all day long on 7-10.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: D-T-F-O, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab the fuck out on 7-10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Task Rock for coining the
phrase 7-10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the 7-10 movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people behind all the oil
movement and the concentrate movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky and blessed to be here in
Colorado where a lot of it happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they say at ground zero at the
forefront of the evolution of a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been around since a lot of it
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I want to talk about some of
the different types of concentrates and
[SPEAKER_03]: different ways of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll talk about some of the gear
that you need for a proper dab sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in short, dab time is 7-10,
and this episode is all about 7-10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about some of the
concentrates we're going to smoke on 7-10.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the best of my memory, most of it
started with old school shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to bust out some shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a fresh gram of shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked this up at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still sealed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's brand new.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a gram of Crescendo OG shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friend Colin Gordon,
Ethos Collective at Ethos Genetics for
[SPEAKER_03]: the, what did he breed here?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Crescendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure that comes from Colin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to bust this open.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make them child-proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Wookie-proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may need scissors, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got teeth though.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that shit open.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to bust out some shatter,
show you what some shatter looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the container.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the container that it comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got all these state regulations
printed on the side here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a bunch of just store stuff,
retail stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Potency, 66.7% THC and zero CBD for 77.9%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's THC and something else in
there, maybe THCV, THCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't list it very well,
but there's other stuff in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: other cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says there may be long-term physical or
mental health risks from using,
[SPEAKER_03]: from use of marijuana, including
additional risk for women who are or may
[SPEAKER_03]: become pregnant or are breastfeeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use of marijuana may impair your ability
to drive a car or operate machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: This product was produced without
regulatory oversight for health safety or
[SPEAKER_03]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an inhaled product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just got all the regular safety
shit on the back there that it needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the fancy Apothecary logo on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friends at Apothecary
Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is shatter, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes in customized.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just, it's like parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically don't use wax paper for your
shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wax comes off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the good shit, get the organic shit,
or get your custom made stuff with your
[SPEAKER_03]: logo, like our friends here at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to unfold this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try not to drop it while I
show it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it sticks to the paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it slides off the paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what shatter looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be in different colors and
consistencies, but mainly this is what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is close to the right color that,
this is the right color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or darker in color.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of the color that you'd
expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit lighter would be better.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit darker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have bought it, but I got this
for the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were not warm, this is a warm day in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now it's more bendy than it
should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if this were warm, when I did that
move, it would just break.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just be a piece of shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it got the name shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was kind of the, the start of the
BHO oil movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the shit that got it all going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could probably dab this whole thing
right now and not be amazingly high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not recommend you do that,
but I have moved on to, we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: show the evolution and show you where we
are now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't buy this stuff anymore,
but this is available.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should show you, if you were going to
dab some shatter, I've got a dab tool
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to show you what the end of
it looks like without any concentrate on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put a little dab on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I would recommend for a
beginner dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to think I'm crazy
because it is a tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may be more than enough to make
somebody cough and get them really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, what I put on the dabber is less
than 0.1 of a gram of a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell that I took anything off
the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could still give this gram to Matt or
Mike and say, here's a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're thinking they got a full gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: This you'll never notice that is missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, if you're looking at the video,
that little tiny piece is what I would
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend you take a dab of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is smaller than a grain of rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's your first dab, do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always take a bigger dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't undab the dab that you just
took.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you take your first dab, it may be
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may get a heavy feeling in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may get the sweats.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the cough that comes with the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That rush, that redness, your face turns
red.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the sweats.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cough a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes that'll give some people a panic
attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Write it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're there for.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm there for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just took a giant dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid money for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just fucked myself up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to feel something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to take a dab and feel the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a ripoff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take a little dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't get what you want from
that first dab, take another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't get what you want from
that one, take a bigger dab next time,
[SPEAKER_03]: but don't go in like I do and take a
monster dab on the first rib.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what basically started the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed you how big of a dab that you
should take.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you how big of a dab I would
take.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to show off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been at this for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you how I go in on some shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably do at least that big of a
dab right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I would get the party started
for some shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably do the whole gram and cough a
couple of times if that's what we had to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I'm going to pass this on to a
couple of friends who smoke more shatter
[SPEAKER_03]: than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the next thing I want to talk about
is also shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the new fad in shatter
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a gram of strawberry milk shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who made the strawberry milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: The potency label says it is 82.1% total
THC and 93.4% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have more potency in this one on
the label than we do in the other shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one is what is known as CRC
shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has been color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is color remediation column.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the C could also be
chromatography because I am not a
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not my area of expertise what I'm
talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted to social media, please teach me
about CRC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a lot of feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it, I'm trying to open this pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it was straight up bickering and
bullshit between concentrate makers and
[SPEAKER_03]: smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I understand, color remediated
concentrate or color remediation columns
[SPEAKER_03]: or color remediation chromatography.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those were typed in my responses in
social media when I asked to be taught
[SPEAKER_03]: about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, there are two sides of the
opinionated forum here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people say that it is polished turds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think that the color remediation was
required because the starting product was
[SPEAKER_03]: not up to par.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they ran the material,
it came out dark or kind of funky or
[SPEAKER_03]: smelled bad or tasted weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it is color remediated to take out
all of the crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it comes out different and it is
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there are two sides, two schools of
thought here, like I said, some people
[SPEAKER_03]: think that that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're cleaning up all product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making it safer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making it cleaner for patients and
consumers, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people also say that that is
allowing growers and producers to create a
[SPEAKER_03]: sub par product because we're just going
to clean it up anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a very fine line and crowds on
how people feel about the CRC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a real seven 10 show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you, Oh, this is pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just now opened this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have showed you more of the
opening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll refold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pulled the package out of the main
package and then I've got the parchment,
[SPEAKER_03]: the customized apothecary parchment here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to be careful when I show this to
the camera, because this is more shatter
[SPEAKER_03]: like, and it is also falling out of the
parchment because of the way that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: tipping it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pick it up with my bare hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to melt and stick, but this is
for the shows case.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the CRC looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking at that on the podcast,
it is on the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much more clear than the
non-remediated product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I will take a photo side by side
and post that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the non-remediated and then
here's the remediated product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see, obviously see color
differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's bright, bright yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has got an amber color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing wrong with the amber shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, the amber shatter is what
we all wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what we were going for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we've got this CRC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, you guys, there are two
camps.
[SPEAKER_03]: People love it or hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is polished turds in some people's
mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is also a really clean and refined
product in some people's mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not going to go too far down that
rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will take a dab of it after this show,
or maybe later in the episode,
[SPEAKER_03]: I may leave the video running.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to develop an opinion on this
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should smell it because I hear a lot
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have any smell or flavor,
or it all smells and tastes the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to lean away from the mic and
smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smell shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like the paper and my fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it smells like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is the CRC.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I will leave the decision making
up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to be biased here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you that there are two camps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people say that it's great because we
can clean up a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can take things out that got left in
and the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_03]: What may have gotten left in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what it can take out,
but I read chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also read pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: They argued that it could take out
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure you guys, there was a lot
of bickering and a lot of controversy in
[SPEAKER_03]: the group when I asked about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is color remediated shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started smoking shatter, then
eventually appeared a product called wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wax happens when, so when you make
shatter, you want it to sit still while it
[SPEAKER_03]: purges.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put it under a heat source,
over a heat source, you put heat
[SPEAKER_03]: underneath it or in a vacuum oven,
and you let the shatter purge so that the
[SPEAKER_03]: residual butane comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned that if you disturb the
shatter while it's sitting there,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you whip it and put air into it,
it would make a fluffier consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would also, in some people's
mind, it was speeding up the process of
[SPEAKER_03]: getting that butane out of the mixture
because we wanted to remove all the
[SPEAKER_03]: butane, wanted a proper purge.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you left butane in there, you got told
you had tain soup or poop soup.
[SPEAKER_03]: But eventually we learned how to whip the
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by whipping shatter, it put air into
it and it turned it into what is known as
[SPEAKER_03]: a wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to pick some of this up,
but it's real crumbly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to get this big chunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't touch your concentrates with
your fingers, you guys, but this is for
[SPEAKER_03]: science.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it's a little bit dark in
color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as clear as the remediated stuff,
not quite as dark as the shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a little bit of air in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, I really liked clean
shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the clean shatter hit well and
tasted good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked some wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on how it was made and what the
consistency was and what it tasted like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, we had not mastered the
art of removing the turps and processing
[SPEAKER_03]: things properly and getting the,
not removing the turps, I apologize,
[SPEAKER_03]: removing the butane, preserving the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brain was tripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had so many thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't pros at it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it didn't taste amazing yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper wax was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something I think I should note about
this wax and the shatter is these are made
[SPEAKER_03]: from dried products.
[SPEAKER_03]: These can be made from dried buds or dried
trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you harvest and you cut off the sugar
leaf, that dry stuff can be used to make
[SPEAKER_03]: wax and the shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got through wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got through shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a white widow wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should give a shout out to the people I
got.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's white widow wax from Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_03]: The label says 64.1% THC and 76.5% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you in the jar without my grubby
fingers on it so you can see what it looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn up the spill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the wax for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it went shatter and wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we started seeing another product
called batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Batter was kind of between the shatter and
the wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was softer and it didn't wax up like
the wax, but it didn't shatter like
[SPEAKER_03]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looked more, I'm going to show you
just so you can get a view of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like just a little dollop of
cheesecake batter or cake batter,
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe some thick butter in the bottom
of the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see if I turn the jar just right,
you can see how they dollop to that right
[SPEAKER_03]: into the container.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just has like a little, like a thing of
whipped cream or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that cool little whip at the top
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tail, it's got that, it looks like a
Hershey kiss in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Blackwater batter from Apothecary
Farms on the package.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says 67.6% total THC and 79.9% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the batter because I feel like it
expands in my lungs a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a big fat dab out of a little bit of
batter and I feel like it's super terpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time, terpy, flavorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps are flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm talking about Terps, I'm talking
about the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I usually find the batter to be
the most preserved Terps of this type of
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate that we've reviewed so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started off with the shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we moved to wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd show you, let's show you how big of a
dab of the wax to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I showed you the shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just again, little tiny dab of the wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gonna show you that that's enough wax to
do a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, that's a big dab of wax right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bigger than you should do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gonna get you going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'll show you how much batter that you
should dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're new at dabbing, I'm going to
bust out some of this batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is black water dabber from Apothecary
Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to throw the dabber around just
for good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll put a dab on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just going to go kind of light and just
want to just dip it into there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they call it a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, you just need a dab,
not, you don't need a fucking dollop or a
[SPEAKER_03]: glob.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more than enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I hold it up to the camera,
that would make Mike cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's enough to get Matt or Mike plenty
stoned and they are dabbers you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe half of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is again, about the size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Size of a piece of rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to knock it in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just hard for me to, it just feels
silly the way that I dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels silly to offer somebody that much
concentrate, but it's about half of a
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you got there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is how much of a dab I think you
should do of wax or batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've covered the first three basics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the first three things that we
kind of fell in love with that we were
[SPEAKER_03]: dabbing on that was available that were
really popular here for dabbers that were
[SPEAKER_03]: available in stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then people started developing new
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a company, I talk about
Apothecary Farms a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a little bit of pioneering in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came up with their own product that
they called Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ambrosia is a blend, basically a blend of
two different concentrates in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: from my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: They made a product called HCFSE and that
stands for high cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_03]: extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you some Tropicana,
Tropicana cookies, full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 79.1% THC, 91% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we call diamonds,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to get this on the
camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is diamonds, basic diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to move my notes out of the
screen here so you guys can't see what's
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up next on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that it looks, they're hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll touch them with my finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: They move around.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not soft and squishy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't pick them up, but I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's falling apart of my fingers,
but that's a diamond for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good size diamond right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're talking about when we
say diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diamonds are a dabber's best friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you hear us talk about sauce,
diamonds and sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sauce is the high terpene full
spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've made a concentrate and I don't
know the science behind this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not claiming to be a concentrate
maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make a concentrate and they leave it
in solution under pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's enough details there.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they do that, the diamonds sink to
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The terps float to the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the heavy diamonds on the bottom,
the liquid up top.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tipping this jar toward the camera the
best I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is mostly liquid, just pure terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 10 grams of liquid terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just liquid terps, but it is mostly
terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if there's a potency label.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 68.2% THC and 79.3% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of that is just terps,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the terp sauce from Apothecary
Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying not to spill it, but I want you
to see down in that jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's thicker than water, but not as thick
as honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost as thick as a maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I don't want to spill it,
but I want you to see what I got going on
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friends at Apothecary made the HT and
the HC, but when they introduced these
[SPEAKER_03]: things, they had mixed them together in
what they were considering the perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: homogenized blend and they call it
ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm going to show you here is the
lost tribe ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is diamonds in sauce together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the diamonds in there and you
can see the sauce in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I like about this, when you dab the
diamonds by themselves, they are very high
[SPEAKER_03]: in THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are very, very high in THC,
but they're a little bit harsh and they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high is not perfectly desirable.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, the THC diamonds,
the high cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_03]: extract, the THC diamonds, that type of
concentrate makes you go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The THC makes your high go straight up
like a firework.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fourth of July just happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes your brain go up like a firework.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I think the terps are what give your
fireworks colors that decides if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get paranoid, if you're going to
get giggles, if you're going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: munchies, if you're going to get a panic
attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: The THC is going to make you get high and
the terpenes, whichever terpenes are
[SPEAKER_03]: present in your concentrate are what are
going to dictate the type of high you
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: That buzz could be different for different
mind types, different chemistries,
[SPEAKER_03]: different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different people get different effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think limonene is good for my brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Limonene gives some people a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is high terpene full spectrum extract
and that is high terpene full spectrum
[SPEAKER_03]: extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I told you that that was a
lemon G, high terpene full, lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like lemons and gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like lemon pledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon pledge and a skunk punched you right
in the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we've got the Tropicana cookies,
HC diamonds, and then we've got the Lost
[SPEAKER_03]: Tribe ambrosia, which is the blend,
the homogenized blend of both together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten through the shatter,
the batter, the wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gotten all the way up to the terps
and the ambrosias, something that a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people are into.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not my thing, not my flavor,
not for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not hating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just decided that I like other things
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one makes my lungs feel heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like batters, but when I smoke
the SHO, which stands for solventless
[SPEAKER_03]: honey oil, it is really heavy to my lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Jam Band premium ambrosia SHO
from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you what it looks like
then we'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that we did smoke most of it
just because it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid for it and want to get high,
so we smoked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it looks like a little dollop of
cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little lighter in color than all of
the other concentrates like this that I
[SPEAKER_03]: showed you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This came from rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was pressed into rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flowers were pressed into rosin and then
that rosin was made into bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They made bubble hash out of the pressed
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big process to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the more expensive products
on the market right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The solventless concentrates are
definitely more expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very sought after.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big crew of concentrate heads
that just loves solventless concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will pay the premium and they're
after it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff sells out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is 82.1% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get really blazed from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a heavy high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel like you just want to sit down
and chill the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a video game concentrate,
but that's not what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also really, really heavy on my
lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else I should talk about,
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said that that came from pressed
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about original rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've got here is a piece of parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's inside is rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show this to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was made with no chemicals,
no water.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was made with heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a friend who takes a bunch of
paper and puts it in between the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several different methods of
doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it done with a hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it done with a hydraulic press.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it done with everything in
between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my buddy Pedro for making the
best fucking rosin that I have ever
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: This came from a local friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take a bud and they put it in
something with heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine the hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got two hot plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: You press it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever goes in the middle there is going
to get squished and get hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a bunch of pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heat it up to just the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fold up a bud in parchment paper and put
it in between there and press it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call this hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: This came out from a squished and heated
bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just dripped right out into the
parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I don't make the product,
but I do know what it looks like and I do
[SPEAKER_03]: know how to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am kind of excited about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not my favorite concentrate,
but to see people able to make their own
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates at home without any dangerous
products because making BHO and all this
[SPEAKER_03]: other stuff you can put yourself at
danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was done with just fucking a hot
fucking hair straightener or maybe a
[SPEAKER_03]: hydraulic press.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are just squishing buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot of tech to it if you are
going to make your rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you do the research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take my advice, but this can be done
at home for very affordable prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need to squish nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need nugs and a squish source.
[SPEAKER_03]: They pressed it and there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosin is not my favorite because most of
the time I think it tastes like a burnt
[SPEAKER_03]: popsicle stick or a popsicle stick or a
burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't dab right for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not what I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let me sway you because I don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how much rosin I would dab if I
were going to dab a dab of rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all you need if you are a new
dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are an experienced dabber,
you know how much to take for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go in, but if you are new, I want you to
go light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said earlier, you can't undab the
dab you just took.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have that panic attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to do all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am looking at my notes to make sure I
covered all this stuff that I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I did not buy any of is
distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Distillate is distilled fucking
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make a concentrate and sometimes
concentrates are not up to par or
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes they want to do different things
with different components of the
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can separate each cannabinoid,
the THCA, the CBD, whatever cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: you are looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can pull it out in separate columns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they can take the terpenes and
separate them into different columns.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they sell just the THCA, or just the
CBD in a liquid form after it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: distilled, that is a distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times we refer to that as hot dog
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite the same as this CRC tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think it is polished turds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were taking concentrate that was not
up to par.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and distill it, clean it out,
separate all the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can put your own very specific
blend of terps and THC into the pens,
[SPEAKER_03]: into your rigs, into your vape carts,
and you can sell that however you'd like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not buy any.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is clear and it looks a lot like the
terp sauce that I showed you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't spend any money on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to really like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then companies started.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it first came out, I think the
companies were using quality material.
[SPEAKER_03]: As time went on, it got funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the bottom of the barrel.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it hot dog water now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry if you're making distillate and I
just shit all over your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you're making good stuff,
but be careful with the distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of what I showed you can be made from
dry products.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of things have to be made from a
fresh frozen product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't go over live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Live resin has a lot of different textures
and consistencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is made from fresh frozen
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to cut down or fresh frozen
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to cut down your plants,
take off the big leaves, then freeze it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you run that through a butane
extraction machine and it comes out super
[SPEAKER_03]: terpy and delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the essence of that fresh plant
because heat and light destroy terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you cut it down in the middle,
you freeze it and then extract it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've just preserved all of the magic and
it tastes so delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to show you what I believe
to be live batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is batter that was made from fresh
frozen plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the garlic grove.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to crack it open and show you
that one again.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the live batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it says live batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that gives me the opinion that
it was made from fresh frozen plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the live batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very similar to the non-live batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other batter I showed you may have
been a frozen batter as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't indicate that on their package.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one I know was fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I showed you the apothecary
diamonds in sauce, I want to show you some
[SPEAKER_03]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call this full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the high terpene full spectrum
extract and the high cannabinoid full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum extract sold together from
another company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of using the proprietary ambrosia
term at Green Dot Labs, they call it a
[SPEAKER_03]: full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: We say FSE.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to show you this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one had a nice diamond in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the garlic banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love the chunky diamonds in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see those diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I tip it too long, the terp sauce will
run out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the diamonds in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to show you this holy fuck
just because it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, it really says that on the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy fuck from Green Dot Labs,
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a really cool logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to show you the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: See that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice ratio of diamonds to sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the diamonds in sauce,
the full spectrum extract looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've showed you most of the
concentrates on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have some head banger and some sexy
peach, but there's consistencies that
[SPEAKER_03]: you've already seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think now it is time to work our way
toward talking about the equipment that we
[SPEAKER_03]: need and use when we are dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read my list to make sure I got it
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shatter, CRC, wax, batter, diamonds in
sauce, ambrosia, FSE, SHO, distillate,
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got it all you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel secure moving on to the gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the gear section of the podcast,
I want to start by showing you what has
[SPEAKER_03]: become my favorite dab setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nice and easy, not super
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something everybody has access to.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people like a really colorful,
fancy rig from a glass artist that they
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a rig that I know hits like a
fucking truck, ran my face over.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my favorite rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has got a big fat flared out mouthpiece
so that when I put my mouth on it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it fits perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mouth goes in there instead of on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like I'm blowing a trumpet
instead of sucking a pee pee.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fits better.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I take a giant dab, if I've got a
really small pee pee shaped mouthpiece or
[SPEAKER_03]: something with an awkward hole in it,
I get a bunch of concentrate built up on
[SPEAKER_03]: my lips because I take big dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This big flared out mouthpiece doesn't
concentrate my dab, my smoke into one tiny
[SPEAKER_03]: spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for a mustached guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some sort of facial hair all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the flared out mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice this rig is fairly small.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably three and a half inches
tall in the main can piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need a big rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're smoking a bong, you want to
fill a big section with smoke and then
[SPEAKER_03]: pull the carb so you can get all that
smoke to your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to carb the dab rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to put the dab on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to put a cap on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to spin it around and that
smoke is going to go through the water to
[SPEAKER_03]: your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no chamber to fill.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need that big dab, that pull.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a small rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice my nail or banger of choice
today is just a basic, this is called a
[SPEAKER_03]: banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a basic banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 90 degree banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk more about bangers in just a
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my weapon of choice when it comes
to dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heat this piece up until it's the
desired temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I set my, I've got a dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I place the dab in here using my dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dabber has got a hair on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't have been better.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the dab right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the dab is in there, I put a cap on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about the cap and what it does
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just inhale slowly until I've
got my dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that is my favorite rig right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the smaller rig better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better than a bong in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the flared mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, let's talk about the perk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of dirty in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have cleaned that, but this is
reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking seven 10 show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a stem that goes straight down to
the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it splits off two directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call that a hammerhead.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a hit man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hammerhead sidecar is what this is known
as, but that two way perk in there gives
[SPEAKER_03]: me plenty of good filtration, just enough
to cool down the smoke and make it not
[SPEAKER_03]: super hot by the time it gets to my lung.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll inhale through the rig and you can
see the bubbles on both sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how clear that comes up on
the camera, but that is the hit man
[SPEAKER_03]: hammerhead sidecar, my rig, my weapon of
choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk more about some other
equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first got into dabbing,
the first real dab, I started by dabbing
[SPEAKER_03]: by putting concentrates in a bowl and
smoking it in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got me really high, but it wasn't
efficient and effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first real dab off of a real dab rig
came from Daniel Desai at the Broadway
[SPEAKER_03]: Wellness booth at the High Times Cannabis
Cup in Denver, Colorado at the Expo,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Endo, what was that called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking Expo Mart, Expo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget the name of the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little tiny shitty place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the big place, not the Denver Mart,
but Exdo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Exdo is what I think the name of
the place was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But shout out to Big D.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me my first real dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took that dab off of a device known as a
skillet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a skillet anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine was donated for science or history.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the skillet was, it fit inside of
your bong or your rig, your existing
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking apparatus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had a piece that came up out of the
female part, the bowl, wherever your bowl
[SPEAKER_03]: would slide into your bong, it would slide
into there just like your bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it had, it went straight up and
then it curved down and hung upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like an upside down or a right
side up bell actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bell part flared and pointed down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it had a piece of like aluminum wrap
wrapped around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like a hippie made it,
made you a wire wrap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had one piece that extended to
underneath that bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then underneath that bell would go a round
piece of titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a skillet plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd be able to swing it up since it
was on the, it's wrapped around the curved
[SPEAKER_03]: piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, I'm messing this description all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes up and it curves straight down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got a fucking 180 degree angle,
goes straight up, does a U-turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the middle of that U-turn, you would
wrap the titanium fucking twine or wire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you could spin it up and down to
where you could move the plate in and out
[SPEAKER_03]: from underneath the bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that makes sense now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got a U-turn, the bottom of the
U-turn is a bell at one end and it
[SPEAKER_03]: attaches to your bong at the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some resin on my finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see that in the video, just resin,
don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got your U-turn bell on one side
goes into the rig on the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they've got the skillet that swings
up and down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can swing it up, heat it,
swing it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would swing it back down and it goes
under the bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would swing it up and heat it long
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you would slide it under the bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd put your dab on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when the dab melts, your bell is
basically right above it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would just go right into there.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you inhale, I think that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the original way to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a lot of people put their dab on the
skillet and tip the rig and the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: dab would run right off the skillet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a lot of carnage from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were heating that fucking skillet till
it was glowing orange and then hitting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned that that is not the way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've evolved a little bit since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first dabs were coming off of a
skillet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had one here to show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I donated that one to
history, but the thing we got right after
[SPEAKER_03]: that was the domed titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a little sip of this
water and then I'll show you what domed
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this rig is a little tiny rig from a
local glass artist called Solomino Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Solomon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he may have gone to Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you're well, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't seen you in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a little tiny rig known as a
mini rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a 14 millimeter male joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: This joint is a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need a female dome to go on your
male rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we would do is we would put this
piece in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called a nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not watching the video,
I'll try to describe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of looks like a screw.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a long piece and then a top to
it, like a head of a screw.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also would have a nut on it and
you would use that nut to adjust the
[SPEAKER_03]: height.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would put the long end of the screw
into the rig and adjust the nut to where
[SPEAKER_03]: the head of the nut is sticking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you would heat it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would heat up the head of the screw
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pointing at it on the video here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would heat this part up and then we
would put the dome over it so that your
[SPEAKER_03]: dab doesn't get away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd put your dab on the dabber
and put your dab onto the nail through the
[SPEAKER_03]: dome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got your nail would basically
sit where your slide would go into your
[SPEAKER_03]: bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's inside of there, this goes
into the hole and rests on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nut part holds it in place so it
doesn't go too deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heat that part up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you place your dome over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you put the dab onto the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the dab doesn't disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't just fly off into nowhere
because it's got the dome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then as you inhale, if you choose to,
you can kind of cover the dome a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit with your fingers and regulate the
airflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about carb capping and that
stuff here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is where we evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went from the swing arm skillet to the
domed nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big shout out to Task Rock for the nail
that he made here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this was called the flux nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a 14 millimeter flux nail from
highly educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is shazzed and burnt to shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for a new one, but I don't use
this anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just had it around on the shelf for a good
experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you throw this bad bitch in here,
heat it up with the torch, put that on
[SPEAKER_03]: there, drop your dab in there,
then hit it, cap it with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how the dabbing evolved from the
skillet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I think everybody got tired of taking
the dome off and losing domes and dropping
[SPEAKER_03]: domes and having to carry a dome around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the dome would get stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you would take a dab and the dab would
drip down a little bit, it would get
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking stuck and you'd have to heat it up
a little bit with your torch to get the
[SPEAKER_03]: dome off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got tired of the domes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is when we found domeless nails.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to our friend Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, a highly educated for the
domeless dab nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks like a rook from a chess piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a tapered bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got two heat sinks so that the heat
doesn't get too much to your rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it has got a big top.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a big moat type dish in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's got a cylinder down the
middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where your dab doesn't fall right down
the middle hole, it's got a cylindrical
[SPEAKER_03]: piece that sticks up, kind of a chimney.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're watching the video, it will all
make sense to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one fits on the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fits right over there on the outside of
that, just like the dome does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you would heat this part up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd use your dab tool to put your dab
right in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that is where the carb cap comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_03]: The device I've got in my hand is known as
a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from highly educated titanium
also.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a couple of tips available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the flat tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pick up some shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you put your shatter onto the dabber
after you've heated it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the carb cap fits right over the top
of the domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we didn't have a dome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're just using a cap, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you can do, you can use this and
turn it and it's got one hole inside of
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get the hole on the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: You turn this while it's on top of the
nail and that will move the oil around on
[SPEAKER_03]: that nail to disperse the oil better and
get it to fresh heat because sometimes the
[SPEAKER_03]: nail will cool as the oil hits on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take a big dab like I do,
it will cool over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have to take the dome off every
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could scoop up your dab, heat it up,
drop your dab on there, put the cap on it
[SPEAKER_03]: and be ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't as much work, very convenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we go from domeless nails?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Skillet, dome, domeless.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is where we moved into bangers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bangers and carb caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get some of this stuff out of my
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to keep myself organized and on track.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bangers and carb caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: These have become my favorite way to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you a couple of different
examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed you this one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a female banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hole is on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fits onto a male rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a female banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 14 millimeter is the size of the hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a male banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slightly stuck in the rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have to apply some heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just resonating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one goes into the hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense to you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: The male goes into the hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: The female receives the piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: The joint is a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nail is a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a 14 millimeter banger as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither one of these are very expensive
bangers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to be the guy that buys the
expensive stuff, go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to buy something not
overpriced, go for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to find something American made.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my biggest recommendation,
but those are your dab bangers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we have to go from there?
[SPEAKER_03]: A bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: A banger isn't a banger without a good
bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me show you a carb cap and we'll talk
about what a carb cap does and why we're
[SPEAKER_03]: using these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, big shout out to Blissful Glass for
the Grow From Your Heart podcast dab rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you guys follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 99% sure that was Blissful Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: A carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked about taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to heat this up, drop your
dab in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're going to put a carb cap on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why and what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck does this carb cap do?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you put the cap in here, you'll
notice it restricts the airflow when I
[SPEAKER_03]: inhale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch when I inhale without it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now watch when I inhale with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear and see the restricted
airflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hole is smaller, not as much air can
get in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That creates a vacuum and it requires less
heat to make my dab vaporize or volatize,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever the word is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes less heat to get my dab to turn
into a vapor that I can get through the
[SPEAKER_03]: rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the intense heat, I do not burn my
dab off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't burn off the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't burn off the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get a little lower temperature and I
don't burn my throat, my lungs,
[SPEAKER_03]: my esophagus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a smoother dab and it tastes a lot
better honestly when you cap it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the reason of a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to veer off of my notes here
because I forgot to talk about cold start
[SPEAKER_03]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people will put their concentrate in
the banger and then heat it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's acceptable as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to heat the banger and then drop
the dab in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for the cold start dab,
and I didn't talk about inserts either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me make a note on this paper to talk
about inserts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I skipped that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inserts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I look down and see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold start dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold start dabs are cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just what some people prefer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way you don't scorch the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't fry it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're actually getting it as it's heating
up instead of dropping it onto a hot
[SPEAKER_03]: surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if you drop something onto a
scorching hot surface, you just singe it
[SPEAKER_03]: right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you bring it up to temperature,
and then smoke it as it reaches
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature, you get it at that perfect
boiling or volatizing or vaporizing point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the correct term.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people do cold start dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have my insert set up here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have grabbed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: An insert looks like a little tiny thimble
and you put your concentrate in the glass
[SPEAKER_03]: thimble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you heat the banger and drop the
insert into the banger and put the carb
[SPEAKER_03]: cap on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very similar approach as a cold
start dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not singeing the dab right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a double boiler.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to melt chocolate,
if you put chocolate in a pan and turn up
[SPEAKER_03]: the heat, the chocolate's going to burn
and stick to the pan.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put a pan of water on the stove and
then put your pan of chocolate inside that
[SPEAKER_03]: water, you'll slowly heat the chocolate
and it won't burn itself and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: scorch.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the same idea as doing an insert
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're catching the dab as it heats up
instead of at the scorching temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an insert dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to make sure to include that because
I did leave that out on my notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my New Mexico crew who's
always killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: With those fucking insert dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you for it, but God, my lungs are
hurting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Banger and bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showed you the male and the female banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is something fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I've got a really fun device
here in front of me that I may be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: move it a little bit, but I don't want to
get too crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually we got tired, fucking potheads.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got lazy and got tired of heating up
the dab nail constantly between dabs,
[SPEAKER_03]: waiting for it to cool to the right
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heat it up, you let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you put the dab on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take your dab, you set it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next guy scoops up his dab, fucking heats
it, repeats it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a little bit to get a couple of
dabs in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to have a nice dab
session, you can go through a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, some people didn't want us using
butane in some places.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were allowed to consume, but we
couldn't have a torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't be blasting the fucking
butane torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is where we became technologically
advanced and we got something called an
[SPEAKER_03]: E-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm showing you here is a ceramic dab
nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some dab nails were made out of ceramic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people feel that the ceramic
preserves the flavor better than the
[SPEAKER_03]: titanium or the quartz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the quartz is definitely better in
flavor than the titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I switched.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ceramic is great, but it's not my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a hundred percent sold,
but you can see that I do have it and I do
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does give a nice flavor, but it takes
maintenance and it will break eventually,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a quality ceramic nail and a
quality ceramic E-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friends at B-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Ollie at B-nails for the
great hookup on the E-nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has made quarantine easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not bitching about the ceramic nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm honest with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this was a quartz banger on this
E-nail, I would be hitting this all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: time, but the ceramic is simply not my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just being honest with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't cap as well and it's just not
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the banger with the bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this cord, this is a heated element.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is heat coming off of this right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't see it, but this is hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: This cord is running to a box right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to show you the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's plugged in and it's also attached to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got to be gingerly with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This box right here, this end plugs into
the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: This end right here is plugged in to here
and you can see it's got the number 715 on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It said it's 710, but it's about 712.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm dyslexic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 713 now, 714.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is keeping a constant temperature on
the top of this dab nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, if I decided to,
which why the fuck not, I could scoot
[SPEAKER_03]: myself a dab of this garlic grove live
batter and this is always hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no maintenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no prep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I got to do is get a dab, put it on
the dabber and I'll show you how we hit
[SPEAKER_03]: the E-nail you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because why wouldn't I do it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to move the mic out of my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put a cap on it, take a dab and we'll
talk more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're dabbing, now's the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you are new at dabbing,
do not take a dab that big.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a professional dabber's dab and
I'm sure you noticed that when I dropped
[SPEAKER_03]: the cap on that nail, the smoke got even
thicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the temperature to that nail set
kind of low and the concentrate just
[SPEAKER_03]: bubbles when you set it on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't volatize, but as soon as you
put that cap on there, it's like putting a
[SPEAKER_03]: lid on a pan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just traps that heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just cooks it a little more quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really gives you a solid dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tasted delicious, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs
for the garlic grove live batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been some of my favorite shit
lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to ramble for a moment and
get my shit together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get this show moving again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, that was a delicious dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've showed you the ceramic nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've showed you the titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've showed you the quartz crystal banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showed you a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know where we go now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will go to the Terp Pearls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that came really popular for a
little while was a device known as the
[SPEAKER_03]: Terp Pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you what a Terp Pearl is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, these are little glass balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to show you on the camera
without dropping them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just little, exactly what they sound like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Round, perfectly round glass balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to pick them up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two round glass balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do with the Terp Pearls is you get
your banger and you gently, they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to make a tinky noise that I hate the
sound of it, but you drop them right in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when you take a dab, the idea is that
those Terp Pearls will spin around under
[SPEAKER_03]: the pressure of the carb cap and they move
the oil around in your banger to where
[SPEAKER_03]: they touch more of the surface of the
banger, to where your oil doesn't sit in
[SPEAKER_03]: one spot and cool down one area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll move it all over the place and they
also hold heat, so they're melting your
[SPEAKER_03]: dab while they're doing it, instead of
your dab puddling up in one spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes you get a longer,
cleaner, better draw out of a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to use a certain kind of carb cap
to make it work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the cap that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you put it on here and then you draw
through it, if you watch on the camera,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you could see it through
the murky part of that nail, but those
[SPEAKER_03]: little balls in there were rapidly
spinning around the edges of that banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you suck at the right temperature and
you've got oil in there, it'll just keep
[SPEAKER_03]: that, or not the right temperature,
the right pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll keep those balls moving around and
that'll just keep your oil moving over the
[SPEAKER_03]: heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't burn the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't create a puddle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a bigger, fatter dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people who take big dabs, that is
definitely a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just use the bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take a big, fat dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to clean the turp pearls often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just more shit to clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a fad for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a try.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into it, you may love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people love it just for the novelty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if they spin in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely hear them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's intense when you take a dab with no
dab and you're just sucking and sucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put these turp pearls away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that covers most of the dabbing
equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you feel like I've forgotten any
legends that should have been included in
[SPEAKER_03]: the list, please send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's talk about some of the other
things that are required for taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I almost forgot to show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I've got a titanium nail for the
e-nail system.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a different cord.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just plug this one in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, again, is from highly educated
titanium.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I decided to switch up to the tie,
I could do that, but I do prefer the
[SPEAKER_03]: ceramic over the titanium, but I prefer
the quartz over everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just my personal opinion, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really pays me to say any of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to the extra parts that we
need for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something you can't dab without,
the torch, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without an e-nail, you definitely need a
torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to be able to heat up
your banger somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a rig with a banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you'll need a torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll need a torch to heat up the banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you will need a dabber to put the dab
into the banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I highly recommend a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a nice bubble carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to go with Tert Pearls,
make sure you get the appropriate carb cap
[SPEAKER_03]: that will make the Tert Pearls spin.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're shopping for your pearls,
the appropriate carb cap probably will be
[SPEAKER_03]: right next to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a good reputable,
reliable head shop, or if you're shopping
[SPEAKER_03]: online, they should pop up in the same,
should be like people that bought that
[SPEAKER_03]: also bought this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your basics are your rig, your torch,
your dabber, your carb cap, and a quality
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, you're going to need a few
extras.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to need to fill the torch
because a guy like me goes through a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're talking about torches,
let me back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you all to take dabs, but please
just go get yourself like a cigar torch or
[SPEAKER_03]: a little torch like this that doesn't look
like a big crackhead torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys that are dabbing with the big
blue torch on your front porch or at the
[SPEAKER_03]: campsite, that shit looks terrible,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks crackhead-ish to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go get a torch, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take some butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks so much better than that big
fucking canister torch that you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, crackhead Magoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, you're going to need some
butane to fill your torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Butane is not expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need any fancy kind of butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let them really upsell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a normal torch, the cheap
butane is going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you buy an expensive torch,
you may want to get a little pricier
[SPEAKER_03]: butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: They claim there are additives and other
shit in the cheap butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not an expert there, but it could clog
up your torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get an expensive torch,
get good butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing was like 30 or 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's expensive or not to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got two flames and it says the name
of the brand and it says the name of the
[SPEAKER_03]: brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They better work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one actually came from New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one came from a local shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need some butane to keep
the dab torch moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else I recommend is a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I recommend some Q-tips?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always got a thing of glob mop
sitting around because most of the time
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see that this banger is a little
bit cleaner than the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: After I take a dab, once it's cooled off a
little bit, I'll take a Q-tip or two and
[SPEAKER_03]: just mop out the crap right out of the
banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just mop it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just clean it right on out so that the
next time I dab it, it doesn't taste like
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: These Q-tips have a pointed end and are
rounded.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get that pointed end down in there
into the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then use the round end to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have another little container over
here that acts as a trash can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every couple of days, I got to dump that
out and get rid of all my dirty ass
[SPEAKER_03]: Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Q-tips are very, very useful if you're
going to use a banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also Q-tip out the quartz or the,
what's it called again?
[SPEAKER_03]: The ceramic banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember, I didn't do it this time,
wasn't paying attention, was just keeping
[SPEAKER_03]: the show moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing I recommend that will come
in very handy in your dab life,
[SPEAKER_03]: which right now during the COVID situation
is kind of a commodity, but some sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: isopropyl alcohol, some 91% or better
rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're dabbing, life will get sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just set this dabber down right here on
the table and the back of it is sticky
[SPEAKER_03]: from my dabs and I got a sticky spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: My carb cap rolled across the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I got a sticky spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to move it over here out of
my way and now I've got two sticky spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is sticky and it's only been a
few minutes since I've cleaned the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cleaned up before I did this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is sticky over here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of isopropyl alcohol will fix
that right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be your friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like to have alcohol wipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have them out right now because
I'm here by myself, but the little square
[SPEAKER_03]: packets of alcohol wipes, I like those.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you happen to be dabbing with friends
before and or after a COVID situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would still clean the rig with those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just clean the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a mustache.
[SPEAKER_03]: Girls wear lipstick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just clean the fucking mouthpiece
occasionally every couple of dabbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know the guy before you,
don't feel bad about cleaning the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you do know him, don't feel bad
about cleaning the mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing why.
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID is why we should clean mouthpieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't trust anybody's spit or anything
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to take care of ourselves,
but the little alcohol wipes are always
[SPEAKER_03]: handy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to have those, especially at events
where we're smoking in a community
[SPEAKER_03]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we need to talk about?
[SPEAKER_03]: An oil slick pad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of this entire table is covered in a
slick pad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to tip the camera down
and show you what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: This green and white pad here is a slick
pad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing sticks to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a couple of burn marks on it from
cleaning nails and shit, but it keeps the
[SPEAKER_03]: table safe so that my table doesn't get
real super sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: This part, the stickiness wipes right off
real easy with a little bit of rubbing
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend a couple of slick mats or
slick pads, somewhere to store your
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your computer desk or your dabbing
space sticky free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get your mom's table all sticky,
whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just a really good investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep shit nice and clean for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, some paper towels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put them right next to your rubbing
alcohol because you're going to need to
[SPEAKER_03]: clean the table quite often.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see me sometimes doing a podcast
and I reach my arm up and rub my forearm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because I just stuck it in a fucking
dab, so clean the table a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that covers most of the
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I covered most of the gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at all the shit on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I covered that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of different rig styles I should
talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your normal perk type rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the downstem and the hammerhead.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit out of this one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's got like a honeycomb rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you notice, the smoke goes down and
then through this, then there is a disc in
[SPEAKER_03]: here with holes on the top that make the
smoke go straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really cool filtration system.
[SPEAKER_03]: This bubble here prevents the water from
going too high and splashing me in the
[SPEAKER_03]: face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give a little pull of that so you
could see the honeycomb style perk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can see how that water
just goes straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gives it a whole lot of filtration,
a whole bunch of micro bubbles in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got, of course, the Grow From Your
Heart podcast rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just got a little downstem with two holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call that a two hole diffie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be more than two holes now that I'm
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some holes in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this one because it's nice and
small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it fits in the cup holder,
allegedly perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a little mini rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: These used to be all the rage.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one went to a couple of cannabis cups
because it's easy to carry around and it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't topple over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then this one is a little bit unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, it's known.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a company that makes rigs like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call them a Klein.
[SPEAKER_03]: This company calls it an Encycler.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at it, the smoke would go down
this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it would go in through here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it goes up like the other rig through
the honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then as it goes up, the water falls into
these holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if, yeah, you can see there's
a hole here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hole here and another hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the inside of this rig, there's a cone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The water would fall into the holes of the
cone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it swirls like a tornado,
goes down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then out of this drain on the back of the
rig, then back toward the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The water is going up and then recycling
through the conular shape, then through
[SPEAKER_03]: the funnel, then through the drain,
then back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The water is moving as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's known as an Encycler.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a recycler.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an Encycler, but inside of ourselves,
inside of itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give a little pull so you could see
what it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch for the water to fill the holes at
the top and then fill the cylinder on the
[SPEAKER_03]: inside and swirl back down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the neat part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a lot of cool filtration is why I
like this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big, nice, smooth dabs, but here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it a pull so you could see.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see where the water drains back
down in.

[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 710 2020 video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're digging it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I showed you a bunch of cool
rigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked a little bit about dab size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do small dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I keep saying, you can't undo that
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get too high, you're not going to
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to want to dab anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may get paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to discourage you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a small dab and enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take seven little dabs and enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then later on in the week, take a bigger
dab, then work your way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys see me doing monster dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try to be like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying I'm Robocop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying if you're new, the dabs I do
are going to fuck your whole day up and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not going to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a fucking pothead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been training.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a black belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only am I a black belt and growing,
I'm a fucking dabbing black belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not from my ego, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is from my heart caring about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to say I'm a monster
dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like I'm bragging or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying I do heroic doses and I don't
want to watch you try to be a hero and
[SPEAKER_03]: hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do small dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's talk about dab temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do kind of big dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my dabs are hotter than the average
bear.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I heat up the nail, I usually heat it
up until it's almost to the point of glow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need it to glow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know right to where it's about to glow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll put my hand by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hold my hand about, it's probably a half
an inch maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say a good half an inch away
from the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to feel the heat of the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know if I touch it at that temperature,
it's going to fucking suck, but I can get
[SPEAKER_03]: real close.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to cook my hand if I touch
it, but I want it to feel, you can feel
[SPEAKER_03]: the moisture being cooked out of your skin
when you get close to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that sounds bad, but it's just a
pinch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a hurt, but you can feel your
skin kind of contract and go, Ooh,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me away from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's your skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the moisture in your skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just going, I don't think you should do
that, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of experiment with your dab heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: My advice is to go too cool before you go
too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think it's not going to melt,
then go a little bit hotter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the cap on there and draw through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think you could have gotten a
bigger dab, if there's a puddle left,
[SPEAKER_03]: you probably could have gotten hotter,
but I want you to start nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go roasting your fucking lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I should talk about even
[SPEAKER_03]: if you don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's a sensor running up
the cord saying, Oh, the surface of your
[SPEAKER_03]: nail is this temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will adjust.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we are sending out an arbitrary
number worth of heat, a worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity, a kilohertz or something down
this cable to heat up this element.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that heat has to travel to the
head of the machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is kind of an arbitrary number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the perfect setting on your email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't rely on my email number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't rely on anybody else's email number.
[SPEAKER_03]: The manufacturer or who sent it to you may
have a recommendation start there or a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit lower and work your way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better to start with a dab that won't
melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have to waste a couple of dabs,
but that is all about the learning
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just blow a couple of dabs off,
let them evaporate, let them fucking melt,
[SPEAKER_03]: let them waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you get to that point,
perfect temperature, it'll be magical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time you reach for the email,
you'll be able to get that fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect, perfect dab and then clean it
every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it maintenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure to turn it off when you leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no idea how many times I've
walked in the house and fucking saw those
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers lit up on the box and went,
Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anything will go wrong,
but that's, that's a hot thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sitting here on the table while I'm
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a cat, but if I had a cat,
a cat, I know a cat would come knock that
[SPEAKER_03]: over just to be a fucking cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd have fucking dab nail fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: All by the kitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a dab temperature, go below.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want you to roast your lungs,
roast your esophagus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't burn your shit out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go hotter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take too big of a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where else are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hold your dabs in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of people try to take a big
dab and then hold it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not necessary with a dab,
with a bong rip, with a pipe rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no need to try to hold in your
hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will give you OCOPD, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disorder that causes
[SPEAKER_03]: problems in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That pressure is not good for your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your lungs work like a filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you breathed in that smoke,
it got all of the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got all the shit that it was going to
get on the way back out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably took a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a super scientist, but then you
blow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the shit you don't want went into that
cloud.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the shit that you want stayed into
your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hold it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll give yourself lung problems,
heart problems, chest problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get a head rush out of it,
but it's not worth it in the long run.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do not hold your dabs in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't find it necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is most of what I had written
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could cover some etiquette.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're done dabbing, take the carb
cap off of the nail because you don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to pass it like this to me and have it
fall off on my table and break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if we are somewhere carpeted,
like a lot of cars allegedly have carpet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to drop that carb cap
onto my leather seats or onto my floor
[SPEAKER_03]: that's carpeted and then get it all furry
and we got to fucking clean it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're passing it, take the carb
cap off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass them as two separate things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful that way, especially with an
email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not leave this cap on top of the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at what's going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to take your dab like a
fucking stone, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you set these two down together and
you just leave it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're heating up this carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heat's going to climb up to here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is going to come over and be like,
I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll grab this and burn the fuck out of
himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's been sitting here all day,
heating up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not do that to our friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the carb cap off of the rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you dab out of somebody else's
rig and you're not familiar with how to Q
[SPEAKER_03]: tip that fucker out, ask them politely,
Hey bro, will you show me how to Q tip
[SPEAKER_03]: this thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't want to leave your banger
all dirty and chaz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to ask for help with somebody
else's equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the rigs, a lot of the bangers
we're using are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I buy production glass because
I'd rather get the hit than the art.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the punch to the face more than a
colorful rig, but a lot of our friends
[SPEAKER_03]: make beautiful colorful custom art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't break it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be disrespectful with your friend's
glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing I should mention.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you've got your buddy's expensive
glass, don't be boisterous and expressive
[SPEAKER_03]: and too much like, like this rig here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't want you doing that
with my rig right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mine, but if that's your buddy's
maybe move it over here before you start
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking talking with your hands and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep shit like that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our rigs are quite pricey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be uncommon to be at a sesh in
Denver, in Colorado, in LA, wherever you
[SPEAKER_03]: are and come across a 10, 15, $20,000 dab
rig that people just pass around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that kind of shit in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't break people's shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have respect for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is all I've got for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showed you all the gear, gave you some
tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about all the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think now it is time to take some
fucking dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's wrap up the show and then I'm going
to take a couple of dabs out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a dab out of the banger and
that'll probably be the end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I should hit the CRC also.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some homework to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to do this part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep the video recording while I take
some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll play some of the music or
something at the end of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how this will work,
but we'll make it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do it live.

couple of dads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
friend task rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And until next time, take a fat dad and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hit the CRC first because
I've never tried this and it's new to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll probably hit some batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first review of CRC here on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it doesn't have any desirable flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of, uh, it was like dabbing
hospital product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt very sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't have much flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high got me immediately, but it
already feels like it's wearing off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It punched me and then it was like exhale
high, high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not high anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you could tell it didn't
really do much and took a good dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is my review of the CRC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab now of the garlic
Grove live batter off of the email,
[SPEAKER_03]: just because it's convenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will say goodbye for the
evening and I will go find some food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are dabbing now's the time,
uh, please leave a comment and let me know
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're dabbing for seven 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the YouTube comments and type in,
I am dabbing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: For seven 10, I am dabbing garlic Grove
live better dab with me guys and gals.
Okay.
