[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, now that the ads are out of the
way, let's talk a little bit about what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a minute ago I took a giant dab of
some, it's called True Kush, it was super
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush flavory, it was delicious,
but now I am dabbing on some Bordello.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bordello has a really, I don't know,
kind of a cheesy, fruity sort of a thing
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't give me super head high,
but it really makes my body feel nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big shout out to our friends at
Concentrate Supply Company for the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, let me know what you're dabbing
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wanna know what people are
smoking with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to tell you guys what I'm dabbing
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know what you're smoking,
what you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know where you're located.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way I know if you're in a legal or a
non-legal state, a medical or a
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you're smoking and how
you're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you smoking a joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you smoking a Dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you smoking an Indica?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you smoking a Sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you smoking some Jack Flash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you smoking some OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you got going on in your
location.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to know what other people
are smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tweet me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply send a tweet to at GFYHpodcast or
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I want to start off
the podcast by giving everybody a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you for the huge response to episode
number 250.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have gotten so many emails, so many
tweets, so many Facebook messages,
[SPEAKER_02]: so much Instagram interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little bit overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to catch up to all of the
messages, but huge thank you to everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that listened to episode 250.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to everybody that retweeted the
episode, that has shared the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to everybody that has left iTunes
comments and iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, while I'm thanking people,
I owe Mike a huge thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Mike, thanks for coming and being on
episode number 250.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a great contribution to the show
and it looks like people are missing you
[SPEAKER_02]: because we got a lot of tweets about
having you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, dude, thanks for coming and being on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for more episodes with Mike coming up
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brings a new energy to the show and it
keeps it moving a little better than just
[SPEAKER_02]: me here by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, look forward to more Mike coming
on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you're invited, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some podcasts together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come do a show with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: On episode 250, I did a little bit of a
contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing throwback Thursday
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been putting some really creative
music at the beginning of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just me killing time with my
computer here when I'm waiting for
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in some of that creative intro music,
I think it's episode number 248,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a voice and it says, oh shit,
Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: In episode 250, I offered a prize to
anybody who can identify that voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, nobody has identified who said
that little clip.
[SPEAKER_02]: They simply say, oh shit, Rasta Jeff in
the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can identify who that person is,
you will win a prize.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also another contest with a prize
available at the start of that episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a backwards clip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a clip backwards and it's a
person saying something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can identify the person,
you win one prize.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can identify what that person says,
you will win a second prize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are three options for prizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you what the prizes are
because it will vary depending on your
[SPEAKER_02]: location and age.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're here in Colorado and you're over
21, the prizes will be much cooler than if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So three options, listen again,
episode 248, see if you can identify those
[SPEAKER_02]: voices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, everybody has been wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people keep guessing Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just say that because all of my
inboxes are getting stuffed with guesses
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email, my Instagram box, my Twitter,
it is not Doug Benson, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't guess Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a wrong guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was not Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else guessed Ralphie May,
not Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I never got the opportunity
to meet or hang out with Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've hung out and met and smoked and
dabbed with a lot of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: comedians, but Ralphie May was just never
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always did, he did the bigger shows and
the bigger shows, it's a little harder to
[SPEAKER_02]: meet those people that are on that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain levels of fame and success
that these comedians get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it works if I meet them and discover
them and make a present.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made friends with Doug Benson right
before he got to the break that he's
[SPEAKER_02]: getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on TV now and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got to meet them right before they
get there or it's too late for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never got to meet Ralphie.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was already super famous before I
became a comedy nerd and started
[SPEAKER_02]: frequenting comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get to see Ralphie May at the
ComedyWorks South location.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it the Landmark location down at
the Denver Tech Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to see Ralphie there and he did an
amazing show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a heckler that said something
and Ralphie May told him, look,
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucker, there are four exit signs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all show you how to get the fuck out
of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not happy, get the fuck up and
leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the way he did it was so smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did not miss a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be in his act, he just roasted that
heckler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, not Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why I went off on such a long
rant about comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's because I love dabs and comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My point was it's not Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would love it if you keep guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send your guests to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your best bet is to email me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always tweet the guesses to me at
GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take your guesses however you can
get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the best way to get them to me to
where I'll find them the easiest is to
[SPEAKER_02]: send them to me via email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now that I've got all the
business caught up and all that stuff out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the way, let's get into some listener
emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it when you guys email me with
questions and when you need help and
[SPEAKER_02]: guidance, it lets me know that I'm hitting
my target audience because at least one
[SPEAKER_02]: person needed help with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured that if one person needed
help, there's probably a lot more out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that haven't bothered to send me an
email about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna pull the first one off the
stack of emails here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got quite a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, let's see, do they want me to
use their name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna go quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, they don't say, so it goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Rasta, it's me again, the guy who
asked about the trellis, but most call me
[SPEAKER_02]: low lids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two questions I was wanting to run
by you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When should I top a plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Been thinking of doing it in one of my
grows, wasn't sure when the best time
[SPEAKER_02]: would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And second, I know you don't personally
grow with DWC, which is deep water culture
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys, but I'm currently going with
that method and I wasn't sure if you knew
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone that could come on the show and
give some advice and tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loving the show, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting closer to getting caught up and
thanks for the info and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it easy and take a gnarly dab for me,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, first off, let me say thanks
for the great email.
[SPEAKER_02]: This gives me a lot of opportunity to talk
about topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Topping is a very useful trick that you
can do in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also this guy said, take a gnarly dab
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna press pause here you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm talking kind of fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys don't want to listen to me
dab and cough into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to follow listener
instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna take a gnarly dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll be right back and I will
talk about topping plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I will talk about my minimal
experience with deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, podcast world, I am back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took some gigantic dabs of lemon OG
haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bred by Colin at the Ethos
Collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was grown by the crew at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was processed by our friends over
at The Craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great work to everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked the flavor of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like sort of a lemon, like a lemon
candy, but not real overwhelming,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a light lemon candy, like a diluted
lemon candy almost, but in a good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes too much lemon can be too much
lemon, if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the next time I take a dab of it,
I'm going to dunk it into these lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeffrey terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some lemon Jeffrey high terpene
full spectrum extract that I have not
[SPEAKER_02]: finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'm gonna drop a little bit of
that on there next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really lemon it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way it'll be too much lemon in a
good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can answer a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our listener sent an email asking about
topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go on and on about topping
cannabis plants, but I will try to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concise and stick to the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our listener asked about the best time for
topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: The time to top depends on your goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you topping?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us are topping to create a wider
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm topping for.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you grow cannabis plants,
once it starts branching out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: one branch in the middle will take off way
higher than the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one plant, that one branch wants to
be on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so when the pollen comes that that
one branch is certain to get pollen so
[SPEAKER_02]: that it can make seeds for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you notice your male plants
tend to be taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to shoot up top so that
when they pollinate, they can drop their
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen down onto the girls below them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tall parts, they're shooting up
there so that they can get pollen or drop
[SPEAKER_02]: the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you top them to take out that top main
node.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of the leftover nodes will
compete for top space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since you've taken out that top,
if you do it right, you've already created
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a canopy, a level, an even layer
of tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will all become your main tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you want to do it again,
you can top those also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about timing of topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of depends on what you're trying
to do based on when you want to top the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I like to do is let the plant grow
in about a four inch pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once it starts getting tight into
that, I put it into a three gallon pot
[SPEAKER_02]: with a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually a lot of cocoa, a lot of
perlite in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it kind of depends on where I am
and where I'm working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I put it into that three gallon
pot, it's starting to branch out.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm transplanting all them,
I'll go through and cut the top out of all
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant should be, I'm trying to
measure with my hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about 12 to 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 16 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little longer than a drumstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about 18 inches, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: About the top, usually four to six inches
of that is going to be that main top node
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm talking about cutting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to grab that top branch and just
work my way down and just run your hand
[SPEAKER_02]: down it and you can see where to cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of tip it over at a spot and
say, would that make me even?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to make all the other tops,
you want to even them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see where the other tops are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got like a crown, like a little
menorah coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a bunch of branches that even
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you've got a more stretchy plant,
you've only got two of those coming up,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be the top one and
then there's a node coming off the left
[SPEAKER_02]: and a node coming off the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take off right before that left node,
just leave that left and right node.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take out that top piece right out
of the middle, you've officially topped
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a branchier plant,
you can go down lower and cut out until
[SPEAKER_02]: you make them all even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep cutting out that center one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there are a lot of different ways to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to leave some space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to top too close together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would top toward those two branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just Ving out real close together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that if you're not going to
grow a lot of plants in a tight space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing a lot of plants in a tight
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go a little bit lower to create a little
more space between my new tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're mainly asking about timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you want a top?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you let that top branch start to show
itself, that's when I top.
[SPEAKER_02]: What my friend Subcool does, as soon as
the plant is big enough, he tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as it starts showing its first Y
section, like this branch is going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: off this way, this branch is going to go
off this way, and the plant's gotten nice
[SPEAKER_02]: and sturdy now.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as it looks sexy, Sub goes in
there and takes the top out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit brutal, but Subcool
pulls mad weight off of his plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: His plants look like two of everybody's
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else's plants because he topped
them so early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I did that method, I would top
them very small and I would let them grow
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would re-top them once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've made two branches,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you go back a little later and top
the tops of those, those will branch into
[SPEAKER_02]: two and now you've got four main tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure you're going to be
scrogging with the trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would do the method where they grow
out into a nice bush and then just take
[SPEAKER_02]: that main top out of there to where
they're all even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experiment a little, go high, cut out the
top kind of high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Decide you want to cut lower, go a little
lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always cut more off, but you can't
put any back is something you should
[SPEAKER_02]: always remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm topping, I'm topping to create
an even canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I've got 12 golden goat plants that
have all vegged the same length and time,
[SPEAKER_02]: they should all be about the same amount
of bushiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always that one damn branch that
sticks out of the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go through and cut her out and I cut a
little bit lower than you would imagine to
[SPEAKER_02]: make some space in my top so that when I
put the trellis on them, it spread out
[SPEAKER_02]: nice and evenly and I don't have that one
goofy one sticking up real bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that you were the trellis guy in
the email, so you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: trellising.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I would do it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So spread them out to create a canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will give you a better yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you top early, you're going to get
these huge two branches and then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get, you could top those again,
you're going to have four branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wait till it grows up a little bit,
till you get that crown, that menorah and
[SPEAKER_02]: make that top one come out, you create a
little bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do the little bushy thing, then put it
under your scrog, pull one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: branches through every square of your
scrog and now you've started a nice little
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice little canopy will give you a nice
yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you're doing by topping,
you're taking out that main top.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people say there goes your main
cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that thing was going to grow up into
the light and get burnt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to prevent you from lowering
the lights to get all of those other buds
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole bunch of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you spread it out with the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take out that main top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got this nice little layer of buds
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of having one giant cola,
if you've got a five by five space,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've probably got five by five space
worth of nice little buds that are all the
[SPEAKER_02]: same size.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look uniform and they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So top it, throw down one screen,
let it grow for a few days into the other
[SPEAKER_02]: screen, put the other screen, depending on
your space, you know, somewhere between,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we go only six inches apart with
the screens, depending on what strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we go 10 to 12 inches apart,
depending on what strain it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Flash is a floppy little bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Flash, you could put scrog nets up
every six inches all the way through the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole canopy with Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just so floppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So top it, get it under the screen,
top it multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's something that really matters a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you've topped your plants,
give yourself at least 10 to 14 days to
[SPEAKER_02]: veg those plants before you put them into
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just took out the main top of those
plants that held the main hormones in that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those branches have to re-decide
who's going to be the top now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all going to start growing up,
acting like they're going to be the tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to work beautifully because now
you've got a nice, even canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after you've topped your plants,
give them at least 10 to 14 days to
[SPEAKER_02]: recover from the shock you just put them
into before you put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't, you're only going to grow
little tiny buds out of all those top
[SPEAKER_02]: sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to perform the way you
wish they would.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the guy who says you just cut out
your main cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he probably didn't give his plants
time to recover after he did it and he got
[SPEAKER_02]: little shitty buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to top your plants,
give yourself at least 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would prefer 14 days before you put them
into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now your main question was when to top
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see them branching out the way
that you want them to branch out,
[SPEAKER_02]: once they've got like four or five
branches coming off of them that are
[SPEAKER_02]: competing to be the tops and you take out
that main top, they'll really start
[SPEAKER_02]: branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can top them early when they're
still in little pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do it when they start getting a
lot of branches and a nice root ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do it when they're probably,
like I said, about 16, maybe 18 inches
[SPEAKER_02]: tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take out that main top, bring them back
down to about 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look really sexy when you do it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look all nice and even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like you gave everybody a nice flat
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how fast your plants are
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they're going to perform
in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what kind of lights you've
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what kind of genetics you're
using.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I really know is that you're using
deep water culture and you're scrogging
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So top it when it starts to get kind of
branchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I usually do it right about the time I
up pot from a small pot to my finishing
[SPEAKER_02]: pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which like I said, is usually a four by
four square pot or a six inch net pot into
[SPEAKER_02]: a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always using a bunch of cocoa,
a bunch of perlite, maybe a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just depends on what facility I'm growing
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm at a commercial facility,
if I'm at home, if I'm breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's usually just why it varies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I would top you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I was going to keep it short and
concise and I lied to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now the next part of your
question was for tips on deep water
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that I don't personally grow
deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for being gentle on me with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The couple of things I do know about deep
water culture really do matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have got to keep that pH under
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the pH gets too high or too low,
things can go wrong very quickly with your
[SPEAKER_02]: deep water culture system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should talk about what a deep
water culture system is real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different ways to do it,
but mostly you've got a plant that is
[SPEAKER_02]: suspended in a medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time it starts off with those
little hydroton pebbles and a small net
[SPEAKER_02]: pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sits in another bucket usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that bucket has a sprayer on the
bottom of it that sprays a continuous
[SPEAKER_02]: spray to the bottom of the roots to keep
them alive just through a spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of constantly sitting in water or
instead of sitting in a soil, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting oxygenated water all the time,
spraying up to them with nutrients in it
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're getting oxygen, they're getting
plenty of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots grow fucking rapidly in a deep
water culture system.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My explanation was very brief,
but you're basically hanging the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: over a sprayer The little easy cloners,
that is basically the start of deep water
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep water culture is that you just go
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it with multiple plants in one
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most common way I've seen it is one
plant in one bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you've got a five gallon
bucket, maybe a seven gallon bucket with a
[SPEAKER_02]: lid with a little like a modified hole
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a net pot sits in that and you
put your hydroton or your pebbles into
[SPEAKER_02]: that net pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you set a clone inside of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually the clone starts off in a
rock wall cube or something to keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: balanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: You set that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put a sprayer in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sprays up from the bottom and keeps the
roots wet at all times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those roots just grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots grow like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what really matters in there is the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pH in deep water culture is super
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're growing in hydroponic mediums
and methods, the pH and PPMs and temps are
[SPEAKER_02]: much more important than when you're
growing in like a soil-less mix or in
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's much more critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a deep water culture, like everything
else, you've got to keep the pH of your
[SPEAKER_02]: solution around 5.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: The books all say, the internet all says
5.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be very plant specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice that if you've got OG
cushion one pot and super silver haze in
[SPEAKER_02]: another pot, that they're going to want
different pHs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have to learn that
about each plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on your plant,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would start off, maybe start off
around 6.3 and maybe work your way down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that doesn't seem to do it,
go back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to learn how to identify pH
issues in your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, if you start off around 6.3,
you won't have any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually go about 6.2, 6.3 on the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that keeps, we've got 43 different
strains, somewhere between 40 and 50,
[SPEAKER_02]: about 40, I'm gonna say 43, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about 40, 43 different strains on
our shelves right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 6.2, 6.3 keeps them all fairly happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell that a couple, like some of the
other things would like a little lower,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I can't do it because the other plants
would probably get pissed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you get your pH dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, your temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be somewhere between 67 and 72
degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe just a little bit higher would be
okay, but that's when you start getting
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to go too cold because the
roots will get shocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to go too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll start getting mildews.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somewhere between 67 and 72 degrees is
ideal for your water temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: the water temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to keep the air around the
plant a different temperature than the
[SPEAKER_02]: water temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the PPMs are very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something you're going to have to
learn on a plant basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a strain specific, plant by plant
specific basis on how many PPMs to feed
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never go too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read often that like 1800 is too high,
but if you know what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can push the limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not telling you to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feed them rocket fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing we should talk about is
water quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check the quality of the water you're
starting with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a PPM meter, an ECU,
a C meter, a pH meter, why don't you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: check the water that you're starting with?
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you are working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend in a deep water culture
system, I would recommend RO water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy an RO system, a reverse
osmosis system that would give you enough
[SPEAKER_02]: water that you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_02]: However often you're going to change these
buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quality of the water is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start off with good water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find out your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find out how much shit is in that water
before you start so that you can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: do the math on what you're putting in
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now another thing that I kind of mentioned
is changing the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to change the water
and clean out that deep water culture
[SPEAKER_02]: bucket every so often.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how much funk is going to
build up in your buckets, but I would
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend you change that water out at
least once a week or every 10 days at
[SPEAKER_02]: minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I would do it, the way I've seen
it done, instead of having just one five
[SPEAKER_02]: or seven gallon bucket as your base,
it's really easy to have two of those as
[SPEAKER_02]: your base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take the one that's got the pump and
shit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that lid right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set your plant in the root ball right
inside that other bucket as a base for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to put some water in
there because you need weight to hold that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if your roots are going to
get into that water or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do get into that water,
pH that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the roots are going to hang into it,
adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the roots aren't going to touch it,
you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's acting as a base.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in there for weight, for support to
hold that plant because you're putting
[SPEAKER_02]: weight at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it top heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the water's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pro tip for you right before you
fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take the other five gallon bucket with
some water, set the plant right inside
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then take the one that you've been using
and clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a sponge or something and clean that
shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wipe it down real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a hose and hose it out if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand a lot of you live in
apartments or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just clean it out the best that you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want this clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can take some Fizan to it and scrub
it out with Fizan, I would do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get your bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get anything that goes inside the bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill it back up with the appropriate
amount of water so that when you plug in
[SPEAKER_02]: your pump that it sprays to the bottom of
the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill it up with the appropriate amount of
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now put your nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a potassium silicate,
add that first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add your base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then add all your microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then adjust the pH if you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then put that plant right back into that
main bucket that you started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got all fresh nutrients into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the pH is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PPMs are cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the temperature's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plug that bitch back in and get her
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now another thing you're going to have to
watch out for with deep water culture is
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants are growing to grow very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you don't wait too long to
flower or you're going to run out of
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling space.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a couple of more quick small tips
before we wrap up the discussion on deep
[SPEAKER_02]: water culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do buy those pebbles that they use,
the hydrogen clay pebbles, rinse the shit
[SPEAKER_02]: out of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're filthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put them in like a colander or something
and just run water through them and shake
[SPEAKER_02]: them and rinse the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really dusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start running those in your deep
water culture buckets, it's going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: mucking up your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll mess up your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll mess with all of your PPM readings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that shit out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also check everything daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to check everything,
the equipment, your pumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also check the pH and the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you get your temperatures in
there dialed in every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't need to change too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you notice that the water's getting
low, add some water and make sure that you
[SPEAKER_02]: readjust the pH at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your PPMs get too high because the
water does evaporate, just add a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of water in there until you get the
PPMs back to where you want them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1600, 1800, that's pretty high on PPM
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of all of your pH and PPM and EC
levels and all that good stuff and your
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures, calibrate your tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what kind of meters you're
using.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using Bluelab meters,
if you're using Milwaukee meters,
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly suggest you invest in quality
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: pH meters, EC meters, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to use it on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things that help you ensure
healthy and happy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So invest in quality meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use them daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check them very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calibrate them as needed and keep them
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also with a pH meter, you guys always
remember the rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it dries, it dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep the probe on your pH meter wet at
all times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Store it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see so many people fucking ruin their pH
meters by not keeping it wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I gave you some useful advice there
on deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got some nuggets in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rinse those pebbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was probably a good trick to teach
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody needs to be reminded to
calibrate their meters occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also while you're calibrating your meters,
get in there and clean out the filters on
[SPEAKER_02]: your air conditioners if you've got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that people quite often
forget about.

[SPEAKER_02]: And on Instagram, I use my other company
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's iregenetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Search for ire, I-R-I-E, underscore
G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S, ire, underscore genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: ire is a word that means feeling the most
blessed you could feel, feeling the best
[SPEAKER_02]: you could possibly feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pleasing and powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ire.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're sitting on a, maybe for me
it's like sitting on a grassy hill
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath a tree, got some sunshine,
just a little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe got my lady or my dog with me or
maybe both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not too bright and it's not too
cold and it's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the grass is kind of cool on your butt
and the grass feels nice on your toes and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little breeze going on and
you're like, ah, and everything just feels
[SPEAKER_02]: all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you're feeling ire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's got their own ire space.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ire spaces are behind a drum set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love playing some drums.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I get that feeling when
everything just falls together,
[SPEAKER_02]: when the bass guitar is playing,
the guitar starts strumming and the drums
[SPEAKER_02]: are right there and everything is just in
the pocket and all the people are dancing
[SPEAKER_02]: and loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's such an ire feeling for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also growing, breeding,
experiencing, teaching, loving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always been an ire feeling for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: ire genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I did wrap it all around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't just off on a random rant.
[SPEAKER_02]: ire genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post a lot of cannabis photography up
there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post probably two or three photos a day,
depending on how hectic my day is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if you're into cannabis and
cannabis photography, there's something
[SPEAKER_02]: there that you would enjoy looking at.

[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I'll be back Monday with the
Freshie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a huge shout out to Amber
B.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like a bird back it up in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeling so solid but setting a word to be
without a care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swam in the sea that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: The door threw the waves and I felt like a
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt so good that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: My soul has seemed to swim around at
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I swam that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one second I felt like a fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cruising around in the sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feeling stops solid but setting a word
is the feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one second I felt like a fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cruising around in the sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feeling stops solid but setting a word
is the feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be free.
To be free.
To be free.
To
