[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome back everyone, it is time for
episode 441 of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Blue Lemon
Tie Ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says this product contains
67.7% THC and 78.5% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor and aroma of the
Blue Lemon Tie Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that Blue Lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds ridiculous,
but if I broke it open and gave you a
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, you would absolutely agree that
that smells like Blue Lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious and
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely potent Blue Lemon Tie Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode of the podcast,
I would like to introduce you to a new
[SPEAKER_00]: strain called Orangegasm, but before we
get there, let's do some shout outs to

[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, podcast world, at the start of
the show, I said I was going to introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: you to a new strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about one of my newest
creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is a cross of platinum tangy
from our friends at the Garden of Whedon
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by a reversed golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a female golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treated it with a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That solution caused that plant to create
pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pollen sacks contained pollen,
which only contain female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied that female pollen onto the
platinum tangy plant, and we have made
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal when I was creating Orangegasm was
to create a really orange and tangerine
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored, feminized seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think I nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I got was that sweet orange tangerine
creamsicle sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought that platinum tangy flowering
time and platinum tangy growth pattern and
[SPEAKER_00]: structure into the cross, and then it also
added that golden goat potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of sweetness, and some of the
phenotypes even bring out a grapefruit
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of flavor and aroma, which comes from
the golden goat side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main goal was to create a feminized
seed that carried that delicious orange
[SPEAKER_00]: turp flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like in the process I created a
great structured plant that has a great
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and tremendous potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about the Orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start by talking about the parents
of Orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is a cross of the platinum
tangy and golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum tangy is of course a tangy male
named Julius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julius was selected by our friends at the
Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Maddie and Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they used Julius to pollinate a
platinum cookies female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had the platinum Girl Scout
cookies pollinated by Julius.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum tangy has a delicious greasy
orange smell with a hint of that Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout cookies background.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something slightly spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something dirty to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a greasy funky orange with a
hint of armpits, maybe a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the greatest growth structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite things about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that it grows as a grower,
as a commercial grower, platinum tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: always did a great job in the production
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always helped me get bonuses and the
flavors and aromas are unbeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I paired that up with the golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about golden goat for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat is a Hawaiian Romulan male
that pollinated an island sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of great genetics in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that island sweet skunk come out a
lot in the Orangegasm phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what will bring out that pink,
grapefruit sort of aroma that comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: the island sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat was bred by a guy who's known
as Mr. Dank and he is from Topeka,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would like to learn a lot about
golden goat, I suggest checking out
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 418 of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entire episode is heavily focused on
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat brings a really delightful
tropical smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some citrus to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has hints of pineapple to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a beautiful growth structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat always puts out huge harvests
and also I love the potency of golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen golden goat reach impressive
lab test numbers but also sometimes I have
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked golden goat that didn't show
impressive lab tests but it blew me away
[SPEAKER_00]: when I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something special about that
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always been a big fan of golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've obviously fallen in love with it
because you see it in a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used a female golden goat clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was treated with a solution which made
it create pollen sacs which only contained
[SPEAKER_00]: female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have applied that female pollen to the
platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now got the orangegasm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more specifically about the
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a consumer, the first thing you are
going to notice about orangegasm is the
[SPEAKER_00]: insanely intense pungent orange aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is orangey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tangerines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hints of grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost smells like somebody sprayed
orange osium in the room or directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you were in a small compact car
and somebody has got that orange osium and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just won't keep spraying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like you cleaned the entire
world with citrus cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It carries a tremendous orange smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also kind of smells like tang powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you used to make tang back in the day,
it's got that strong overpowering fake
[SPEAKER_00]: orange flavor in some phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some phenotypes will have a really
sweet, smooth, creamsicle sort of aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the array of tangerine and
sweet orange flavor that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best things about orangegasm is
the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a concentrate maker of any
type, you will find a beautiful phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: of orangegasm for your concentrate
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phenotype that works beautifully
for ice water extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phenotype that works beautifully
to be pressed and almost any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes will make wonderful BHO
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are going to smell like
disgusting, delicious, potent pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pungent, sweet oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk enough about the orange
flavor that comes from orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to say oranges in this
episode 3,000 times because that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing I can think of when I smell
these flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know that it tastes and smells
like oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about growing orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very nice growth structure and
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: One good thing about the orangegasm in
comparison to most of the crosses I make
[SPEAKER_00]: is it does not get ridiculously tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get tall but it will not be a
gigantic stretchy plant like most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: other crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one stays a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes on a very nice Christmas tree
type of a shape but then it creates what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call a menorah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of even length branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have one big tall top glory bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a nice even canopy out of the
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it great for sea of green type of
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it great for large commercial
production and it is a wonderful plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really love the structure and the
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, it is really stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes thick stalks and branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do a lot of popping and twisting
and super cropping and this one really
[SPEAKER_00]: takes it well because the branches start
off very thick and very stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in windy conditions or
if you need to put some plants at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of a row where a fan kind of beats them up
a little bit, orangegasm may be a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate for that type of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stalks are so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches are so stout that I don't
worry about the wind whipping the shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does whip the shit out of it,
if it does get beat up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: orangegasm can take a lot of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a very hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum tangy that I used is a very
hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have beat the shit out of it in many
different ways in commercial environments
[SPEAKER_00]: and it never shows me any stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always just like, hey, I'm over here
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing exactly what you need me to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then golden goat is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crossing these two created a very
energetic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it grows quite quickly in veg and in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a lot of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get very robust, fat stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to transplant more early than
you were used to if you were growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, like I said before, it likes
being popped and twisted and it enjoys
[SPEAKER_00]: being topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you may not need to top it too
much because it does grow that menorah
[SPEAKER_00]: type of a shape where it's got a bunch of
arms that all reach up to the same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may get one kind of one dominant bud,
but it's not going to get a big giant
[SPEAKER_00]: glory cola in many phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat dominant phenotype will
show you that glory cola, but more of your
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum tangy dominant phenotypes aren't
going to have that giant stretch on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That perfect growth structure makes
orangegasm really easy to trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to throw her in a large
commercial facility or if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: put her in a tent, she likes to be worked
into a net.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people like to really work
the branches into the net and spread them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm doesn't need a lot of help to
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of spreads wide on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you will need is a little bit of
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these parents are heavy producers,
so the offspring are obviously going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: large producing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get big buds throughout
the entire grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be ready, have some supports,
have some tomato cages, have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising going on, but these plants
really do appreciate some trellising and
[SPEAKER_00]: some scrogging and some sort of supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also take very well to defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum tangy dominant phenotypes
won't require heavy defoliation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the golden goat phenotypes will take
very well to semi-heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings us to another good point,
the calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many phenotypes of the orangegasm are not
very leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them will have a very long
petiole with a very big fan leaf coming
[SPEAKER_00]: off of it and not a lot of small leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is known as a good calyx to leaf
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easy to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the plant is growing,
that gives less opportunity and potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for pests and mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are less places for bugs to hide and
less places for powdery mildew to cling
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives us less potential for
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does make orangegasm a great strain
for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were a new grower, I highly
recommend orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum tangy is really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat is very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the orangegasm is even simpler to grow
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is only available in female
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that saves one more step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to search out the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making it even easier for beginner
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is also a great strain for
outdoor growers in some locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes of orangegasm will finish
as early as 56 to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes will take as long as 70
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one of those earlier
finishing phenotypes, they do beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a lot of problems because
of that wonderful calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed that the orangegasm does
very well in high heat conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing in a hot outdoor
environment, orangegasm will do very well
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tolerates high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about the orangegasm
is it takes errors very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a mistake, orangegasm is not
going to show you immediately that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing some sour diesel type
stuff, if you're growing an OG Kush plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and you mess up with one feeding,
you are going to pay for that in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your harvest will not be what you
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality may not be what you expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were growing orangegasm,
you have a lot of room for mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a very forgiving plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is a good way to segue into
talking about feeding orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is very easy to feed and get dialed
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will go macronutrient deficient early
in flower if you don't boost up the NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our cannabis plants do absorb 90%
of their nitrogen through their veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you do not let these plants get
nitrogen deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing to look for when you are
growing orangegasm is to watch for
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiencies or nutrient burns
and get that dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thinner-leaved golden goat phenotypes
are going to show you that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing nutrient burn before you see
it pop up in the larger-leaved
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum-tangy dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to that skinny leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see it starting to get its
nails done, you can tell that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably giving it a little bit too much
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that skinny leaf phenotype is starting
to get a little bit pale, it probably
[SPEAKER_00]: needs more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the skinny-leaved
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to give you hints before
the larger-leaved phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've mentioned it briefly before,
but most phenotypes of orangegasm are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to flower from somewhere between 60
and 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may finish earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may finish closer to the
56-day mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather not set that expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather say 60 to 70 days to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some outliers that go two to
four days longer each direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can generally rely on that 60 to
70-day timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be easier to tell early in flower
with the orangegasm which phenotypes will
[SPEAKER_00]: go longer because of the two parents I
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skinnier-leaved phenotypes are going
to take closer to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a golden goat dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will need to go a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wider platinum-tangy dominant leaves,
that phenotype will probably finish closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to the 60-day mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the leaf size,
the leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will indicate to you how long to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you run these, I suggest
going 70 full days in flower if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that feels like a good way to segue
into talking about expected phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen several different phenotypes pop
up from the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them very closely resemble the
platinum-tangy and the golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do feel like I have seen some island
sweet skunk dominant phenotypes pop up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the common phenotypes you can
expect to see are the golden goat dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one grows very much like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got very long, skinny, and pointy
leaves, and it makes very pine cone-shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: top buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very tropical kind of a
pineapple-y and citrus sort of aroma to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that one will bring out a little
bit of a grapefruit smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does come from the island sweet
skunk, which we'll talk about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another phenotype that obviously
is platinum-tangy dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one with big, wide,
fat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the platinum-tangy dominant
phenotype will produce purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not make a lot of purple leaf and
purple bud, but it will make purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to see the
platinum-tangy dominant phenotype early in
[SPEAKER_00]: your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really great phenotype that you are
going to find in packs of orangegasm is a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that I have named the mean girl
or the jagged girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, I made another cross
called heart of gold, and it had a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that I called the mean girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was another golden goat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this same trait coming up in the
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these phenotypes produce a bud
that just looks mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are really jagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are really serrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really tight structure to it,
and it just looks like it would be really
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, or it looks like it could be
weaponized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just call it the mean girl phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's probably got a
switchblade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype grows a little bit more
like the golden goat, but it carries that
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious, sweet platinum-tangy aroma,
so I really love the mean girl phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit airier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds aren't as tight and compact and
dense as some of the platinum-tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've listened to the podcast for
a while, I'm sure you've heard me say that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think airy buds are going to be the
future for concentrate production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you have more surface area for
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's a little bit easier to
extract something off of a fluffier,
[SPEAKER_00]: airier bud than it is a tighter,
more dense bud, so I feel like this one is
[SPEAKER_00]: great for concentrate production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you will see that the mean girl
phenotype creates what I call a taco leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf will curl up, kind of looks like
a canoe, kind of looks like a taco shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just folds in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people will think that that
is a result of excessive heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that is the issue, but that is
just a common trait that you will see
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in the mean girl phenotype of
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype is going to extract very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype is going to have one of the
most intense orange flavors and aromas
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have ever bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the mean girl phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the one I would look for
if you're making concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going for potency, you may go
for more of the golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant-leaning phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going for that orange flavor,
of course go for those wider-leaved,
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum-tangy dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is one phenotype that I call the
outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit wispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She produces fairly well, but not as well
as the other phenotypes, but what she does
[SPEAKER_00]: do is she is encrusted in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no room for more resin on those
tiny buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you dry it and cure it and smoke
it, the flavor is like disgusting,
[SPEAKER_00]: sour, tart grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so puny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so fungent and weird that it made my
mouth pucker just thinking about it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are into pink grapefruit or pink
lemonade and grapefruit sort of aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: that phenotype may be the one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that phenotype came from the
island sweet skunk parent from the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are seeing things way down the line
pop out in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this phenotype pops up, if you've
paid attention, you will know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is immediately the tallest phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the one with the branches that are
trying to all keep up with each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are all stretching in competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people may want to call this
phenotype immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are into grapefruits, this is the
one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will produce okay, but the potency and
the flavors are going to be off the
[SPEAKER_00]: charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing just for yourself and
you're into that sweet grapefruit sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a flavor, I really hope that you are the
one that finds this semi-rare ugly
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype of the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the one that
everybody is going to want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably obvious why I call it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 50% golden goat and it is 50%
platinum tangy and we got the best half of
[SPEAKER_00]: each one for this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It carries a tremendous sweet orange
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got that perfect the golden goat
stretch, but then it's also got that
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum tangy menorah shape and then it
carries the potency of the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype tends to finish up right
around 63 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing this strain in a
commercial facility, that is the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want that is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts out great weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts out great flavors and aromas and
the bag appeal on the finished dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured buds is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are bright green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistols dry up and they stay bright
orange and it creates great bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 50-50 phenotype is perfect if you
were growing for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should mention about the
orangegasm is temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers like to lower the temperature
of their flowering room, lay in flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring out the color of their flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not necessary with orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen any benefits to reducing
the temperatures of the grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: lay in flower when growing orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm seems to prefer higher
temperatures and I have not seen any
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage to reducing the temperature,
lay in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen any improved color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any speed up in flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that it is best just to
leave the room just like it is and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue flowering until the end with
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't reduce the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do any tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep it just like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to like it fairly warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it warm all the way through
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about reducing the temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to get it cold late in the
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may be really advantageous for
people who are growing large facilities or
[SPEAKER_00]: running perpetual cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you might want to reduce the
temperature in your grow room so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get that one strain to finish earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes reducing the temperature late in
flower will bring out some great colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it makes the plants dense up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that that does not work for
the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes it warm all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that covers all of the grow
details of orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about smoking
orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is a delight to smoke of course
because those tremendous orange and
[SPEAKER_00]: tangerine and sweet candy orange flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really like about it is the
really good mood and great vibe that I
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: from smoking orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't completely obliterate my brain
to where I can't think and can't focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does put me in a really good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just puts a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're having a rough morning,
if you've had a shitty day, smoke a little
[SPEAKER_00]: orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the O face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll smoke a little and you go,
oh, you just blurt your smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mouth tastes like oranges and your
stress goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your shoulders relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I have noticed is that
it works great for people with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are experiencing anxiety or if you
want to keep the anxiety away,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking the orangegasm will chill you the
fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts you in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you forget that you are anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you forget that you were worried
about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just puts a little pep in your step
and puts you in a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think orangegasm would make great
morning medicine if you're a person who
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to medicate in the morning,
but you still want to be able to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want your brain to get too blown
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get too lazy,
but you want to put a little pep in your
[SPEAKER_00]: step and lively up the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where orangegasm fits in
perfectly.
