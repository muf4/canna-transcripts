[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, grab your pipes,
grab your bongs, pack up a fat bull,
[SPEAKER_00]: roll up a fat joint, because in this
episode, we are going to celebrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I woke up to a text
message from a close friend letting me
[SPEAKER_00]: know that one of my heroes, one of my
idols, one of my mentors passed away this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you will know who Subcool was,
but if you're not sure, Subcool was a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool was a cannabis pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool was a cannabis educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool was the creator of very many
popular strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool made Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool made Vortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool made Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool was very well known in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got very many high times cannabis cup
awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gotten a high times lifetime
achievement award.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also known as the weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool was very influential in my
cannabis career, my cannabis development
[SPEAKER_00]: and heavily influential in my cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at his photography and you
look at the evolution of my photography,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can for sure see Subby's influence in
my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool did a lot of things for our
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing he was very well known for
was his super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool has a great super soil recipe
online that many people base their super
[SPEAKER_00]: soil recipes off of to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool also did what was known as the
School of Dank, where he would do a large
[SPEAKER_00]: seminar type class where a lot of people
would fly from around the world and
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool would teach a multiple day class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most of the time, the proceeds
from those classes were donated to a
[SPEAKER_00]: charity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times it was to autism awareness and
to raise funds for kids with autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Subcool did a lot of great things,
not just for the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for his regular community and the
people around him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, and unfortunately, Subcool has
left the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool is no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool had been battling a condition
known as Alpha 1 for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow him online, you know that
he's been getting injections and medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for quite a while to treat this condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, his body finally gave out
and he did not wake up this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he went peacefully in his sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that was quick and painless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking heartbroken, but Subby
wouldn't want me to sit here and cry about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subby would want me to smoke a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool would want me to sprout some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Subcool would want me to get back
to business teaching you how to grow top
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blow my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take about 47 fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I get back, I promise to
deliver a top shelf podcast dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy, Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back through the magic of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am already.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a lot of fat dabs, feel a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't going to do a full
episode on Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some other stuff I was going to talk
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to do a regular show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while I was taking my dabs,
I was just chilling and thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: Subby and I was like, we should give the
dude a full show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be a brief episode,
fully dedicated to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to catch my breath now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't want any of these thoughts
to escape my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to hit record and get
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember chilling out way back in
the day, growing Subcool strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on the couch watching Subcool's
weed nerd videos while I was trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been following Subby for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching the weed nerd shows before
they were the weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a bunch of just random Subcool
videos that he would put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember watching all of those way
before he was the weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the very first seeds I
purchased from the Attitude Seed Bank,
[SPEAKER_00]: my first order had Subcool seeds in that
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were TGA Subcool seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember ordering them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been following Subcool for quite a
while and I've learned a lot from the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will address before we get too
far is, yeah, the dude had some quirks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did some weird shit, but we all have
our own quirks and we all do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to excuse that for this episode
because I've got nothing but love and
[SPEAKER_00]: respect for the guy and this is a tribute
to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to say something
negative about him in the comments or out
[SPEAKER_00]: loud or something, just shut the fuck up
right now because I've got his back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to keep moving forward with my
tribute to my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool is a teacher, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me so much and you can see it in
my growth style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to run seven gallon pots with
tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to branch them out real wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to cram too many into a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get the light too close to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My rooms looked just like Subcool came in
there and built my rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see my evolution of my growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a whole bunch of one gallon
pots and trying to pack the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started watching Subcool and he
was like, why don't you top them,
[SPEAKER_00]: spread them out a little bit, put them in
tomato cages, get a little bit bigger of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, start growing it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was showing me that he was pulling this
much weight from each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, shit, I'm running
the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't I do it this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started working really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got better at growing through watching a
lot of Subcool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I or anybody else ever had a
question about something he said on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed Nerd show, you could just send him a
message and he would answer you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would answer you directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd say, oh bro, this is what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he would ask you questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means when he's asking questions,
he actually cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants more info so that he can answer
you again appropriately and get your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Subcool was a great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a valuable asset to a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a valuable asset to an educated
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew a lot of ins and outs of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made some predictions to me in
conversations about the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: about people, and that shit always came
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I need to give Subcool some
credit for is a lot of the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: my cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: He inspired me and educated me a lot on my
cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I frame a shot, the way I outline
a shot, the way I background a shot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I set up a shot is very inspired
by Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool put out a couple of books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool's The Science of Dank had a lot of
great photography and that photography
[SPEAKER_00]: really improved my photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It inspired me so much that I wanted to do
things differently and I started taking
[SPEAKER_00]: better photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads me into another thing that I
really want to shout Subcool out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subby was one of the first people I saw
taking and sharing photos of male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was posting photos of one of his
legendary studs that he called The Space
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was posting those photos a long time
ago in forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Space Dude is featured in a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many beautiful pictures of
the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see enough of that and Sub took
some great, great shots of his male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and shared those.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told a lot of great stories about how
he found his male plant and then he used
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit out of that male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some similarities here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did find a stud male and of course I
used the shit out of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became just as popular as some of my
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some of you it sounds like I'm just
kissing this old guy's ass but he was
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly very important and very
influential in my development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics would not exist if Subcool
did not pave the way and kind of teach me
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of other breeders and
growers and influential people along that
[SPEAKER_00]: path but Subcool was a very big part of my
education and my development.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing the Weed Nerd Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of taught us how to go online and
do this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing it before a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Subcool did inspire me and kind of
teach me how to do it in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a few years on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got started before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely had a great torch to pass
and I'm proud to have grabbed one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: torches that Subcool is passing out to
keep carrying because he taught a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool did a lot of time for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool has been arrested and served a lot
of his life in jail because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to give a big shout out to Miss
Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: While Subby was serving time, Miss Jill
was finding cannabis books and in jail you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't have books that have the word weed
or cannabis or reefer in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you definitely can't have books that
teach you how to grow cannabis in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Miss Jill was finding cannabis grow
books and rewriting them and taking out
[SPEAKER_00]: the word cannabis and putting tomatoes or
blueberries in there so that Sub was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to read these books while he was in jail
and keep up on his cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to give a big shout out to Miss
Jill also.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a huge part of TGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is actually now the owner of TGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that Sub and Jill had a rocky
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not putting any information out there
that's private but I do know they resolved
[SPEAKER_00]: their shit before Subby was gone and I
know that she was a huge part of the team
[SPEAKER_00]: and she took great care of Sub and Jill
takes great care of everybody around her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to send her a big shout out also
since we're talking about TGA and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Avenger family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Subcool history because Jill is a
major part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill actually bred the Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about Jilly Bean coming
from Subcool and TGA that was one of Miss
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill's creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's still killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you guys support TGA and Miss
Jill still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to make sure to send her some
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took care of Subby.
[SPEAKER_00]: She helped out Subby while he was in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a great partner in crime for
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going for almost 10 minutes
talking about my buddy Subby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up this tribute here
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about some of the strains
that Subcool is very known for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys if you have ever smoked Jack the
Ripper that is a Subcool strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever smoked Space Queen that was
a Subcool and Miss Jill strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have been Miss Jill but I'm
sure Sub and Miss Jill worked on that one
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever smoked Vortex that was from
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that old stuff back in the day
was coming from Subcool and you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back around 2010 there was a dispensary in
Denver called The Clinic and they carried
[SPEAKER_00]: some Vortex batter that was bred by
Subcool and grown by somebody there in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver and extracted by a local guy in
Denver and it was available on the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: at The Clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Vortex concentrate was one of my
favorite concentrates ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That place is 130 miles from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would drive up there as soon as I saw
that shit come up on weed maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would drive up there and buy as much as
they would sell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they started making limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to take friends with me so they
could buy as much as they would sell them
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love that Vortex concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would give me the dab sweats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make me shake a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would give me a little bit of paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be looking for my sunglasses while I
was fucking wearing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd try to find my keys while they were in
my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that sort of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I miss that Vortex concentrate but
that's the kind of stuff that Subcool
[SPEAKER_00]: bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly sativa dominant kind of high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of real candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did a lot of great breeding and I
used many of his creations in my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually used his plush berry in my
black cherry chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also used his space queen in one of my
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a female space queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed a grateful dog plant and I made
what I called space bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was space queen to grateful dog and it
was feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a sweet female out of there and I
pollinated that with my Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called that creation Space Force and
that is still available today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only a few packs left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Space Force is one of my crosses that
came from one of Subcool's creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, I just wanted to take a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I guess I wanted to take 12
minutes and I wanted to kind of pay
[SPEAKER_00]: tribute to somebody who really helped me
develop as a cannabis grower, as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis breeder, as a cannabis business
person, as a cannabis educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give a giant shout out to my
friend Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Subcool, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be where I am without your
guidance and inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to do
a lot of advertising at the end of this
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to
Subcool, giant shout out to Miss Jill,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a giant shout out to the entire TGA
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
