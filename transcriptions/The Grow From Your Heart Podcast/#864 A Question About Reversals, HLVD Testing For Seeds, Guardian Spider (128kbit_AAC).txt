[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 864 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got another fun episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do want to send a
few shout outs to a few of the great folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start off with the big Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dish Taco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send a fist bump and a thank you
shout out to Hi Hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's wrap it up with the big Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friend, Philabong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_01]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, big thanks and big shout out
to everybody who continues to support the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's jump into the question
and answer portion of today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That main website is ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that website, you will find a row of
tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top, there's a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them says Grow Help or Grow
Questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that Grow Help or Grow
Question tab, send me a Grow Question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: At ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question on today's show came
from somebody who wants to be called Ivan
[SPEAKER_01]: Yurkinoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ivan, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox for a
coupon code because you've got a code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also check your spam.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I love learning
all about plant breeding from your show
[SPEAKER_01]: and I appreciate all you do for the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great compliment there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, On several occasions,
I have been successful in reversing a
[SPEAKER_01]: female photo period using colloidal
silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this person is using colloidal
silver, which is a common practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: to reverse plants to create feminized
pollen to make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says they've been successful doing it,
so they're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, My question is, here's where we
get fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the plant shows signs that it has
been reversed, an example, it's starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow pollen seeds, sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I then be able to cut clones and
grow these plants out as male plants to be
[SPEAKER_01]: used for future breeding purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, what would be the best time to take
clones from my new father plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand exactly what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it does not work the way
you are kind of hoping that it is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me kind of retrace this question
here, frame it in a way that everybody is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person is taking a female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are treating it with colloidal
silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: That colloidal silver will in turn,
there's a chemical process that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to focus on that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is that causes that plant to
create pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pollen is all female because
hopefully they chose a plant that is all
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only X chromosomes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a lack of Y chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that pollen is transferred to another
female plant that is all X chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Available in this breeding project,
we will make all female seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what is supposed to happen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person is asking when they treat this
female plant that becomes the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: donor, can they then cut clones of that
plant and treat that clone as if it were a
[SPEAKER_01]: male plant, so to speak, a constant pollen
donating plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that trait continue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that process stay permanent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, no, that is not a permanent
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant eventually over time will grow
out of that chemical treatment that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been giving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll say, hey, all that chemical spray is
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The silver is not coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: My copper is not disrupted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to fuck with my ethylene
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can start going back to a normal female
plant and growing female again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cut that clone of that reversed
plant, let it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like reveging, but it will
revege and it will go back into its female
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why we've got to spray the plants
so many times when we're using colloidal
[SPEAKER_01]: silver, silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to spray them that week before
and then I do it every three days for
[SPEAKER_01]: seven or eight, sometimes nine or 10
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep going depending on, so if it's like
a nine or 10 week plant, I just spray it
[SPEAKER_01]: up to day 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an 11 or 12 week plant,
any further than that, I will spray it
[SPEAKER_01]: like up to day 24, 27, maybe even day 30
because I need it to continue to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: reversed for longer and it may decide to
go back to its original female form if I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't keep treating it with that silver
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your idea is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it worked that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would save me time, money, space,
effort, energy, a lot of headaches,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of heartaches, a lot of questions,
a lot of concerns, a lot of stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does not work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that female will find its
way back to female.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just giving it a chemical that's
confusing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going, hey, I'm not sure what to do,
so this is how I'm acting now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you put that plant back in its normal
condition, quit giving it that chemical,
[SPEAKER_01]: that silver disappears, grows out of that,
all that hormonal disruption goes back
[SPEAKER_01]: into balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm thinking as I'm speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to have nine thoughts ahead of
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once all that hormonal imbalance is
rebalanced, then the plant will just be
[SPEAKER_01]: your normal female plant once again,
just like it was when you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I answered that one pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we cut clones and grow them out,
will it be a male?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, those will go back to female plants,
just like you started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to reverse it all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm always doing the reversals
every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, Ivan, thank you for the great
question.

[SPEAKER_01]: That expiration date on there is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people out there, your codes are
going to end by the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you, make sure you give it a
look-see, give it a check-see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check your coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check your spam.

[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's on sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing an end of the year inventory
blowout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check the pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got another great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one also did come from that Grow Help
tab on iRedirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from our new friend Chauncey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chauncey, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chauncey, check your inbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a coupon code for free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's better than free seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, free seeds are the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes, hey Rasta Jeff,
hey Chauncey, good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thank you for the podcast and for
always being there with hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes to escape into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a podcast consumer as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to podcasts when the day's not
going, even when the day is going the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that I want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes if I just need my head on
something else, something else in my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain, I just go to one of my favorite
podcasts, click play, and I can escape
[SPEAKER_01]: into that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be laughing at Louis and Zach or
getting grossed out by Legion of Skanks or
[SPEAKER_01]: something great will be happening in no
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like being your little escape and you're
learning something while you're escaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a point to this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, have you found any companies that
can perform HLV testing on seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good question as a seed
seller, a seed breeder, a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very good person to ask about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said, did they validate their test to
be performed on seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have an amazing day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers, Chauncey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chauncey, big cheers, my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is about testing seeds,
actual seed batches, batches of seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been in contact with somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say too much because things are
things are in development, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can't talk too much about what's
being worked on in the conversations that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been had.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I can tell you is right now there is
not a way to test the seeds without
[SPEAKER_01]: destroying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: To test a seed, to see if it's got hop
latent viroid in that individual seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: that seed must be crushed and destroyed in
the testing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how the test works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You basically crush the seed, rub the
inside onto a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy, but you got to crush it and rub
it onto something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that is your sample that the test
is taken from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to destroy the seed basically
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now you can't grow the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so far, what we have come up with,
the method that we are using is we can
[SPEAKER_01]: test the batch of seed and tell you if the
seeds that were tested themselves had hop
[SPEAKER_01]: latent viroid in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing is testing somewhere
between 10 and 30 percent of a population
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just say I've got a hundred seeds
of a new cross, which would be a small
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generally going to be a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll say a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say we've got a thousand seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made a thousand seeds from a batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to test these and see if there is
any HLV in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of that thousand, we would scoop out
somewhere between 100 and 300 seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 30 percent of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would test those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we don't see any virus in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that batch of those seeds is clean,
that's how we're mostly going to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: we trust that this batch of seeds is
clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we've tested 30 percent of them and the
virus is not present, the seeds should be
[SPEAKER_01]: clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the standard at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may find something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're working with now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, the other safeguard,
the other the other redundancy that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is we are checking each parent plant
of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so if we made let's just
hypothetically say we made so I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to give any details away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to share strain names and things,
but I don't want to delve into the future
[SPEAKER_01]: and tell you what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say we made some lemon Jeffrey
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those have been tested for HLV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those have recently been sent in
for HLV tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two plants are clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are STD free, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are clean plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I breed with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as a double check, a triple
check, we send in the seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds are destroyed and tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that three out of 10 of those
seeds do not have the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the mom, the dad and the babies
have all kind of been tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, there's not a way without
destroying the seed that we can test to
[SPEAKER_01]: find the presence or the absence of HLVD
in there unless we crush, destroy and use
[SPEAKER_01]: that crushed up seed as the testing agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how it's got to be done right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the tests that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that when it does evolve and we have
more stuff to go by, I definitely will
[SPEAKER_01]: update you because I would love to brag
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to say that every one of my seeds
is HLV tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I did that, every one of my seeds
would be crushed and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bred from HLV tested plants is
what I can guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a random process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't I'm not paid by anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody pays me to advertise with them
actually use two different HLV testing
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on if I want my stuff
right now or if I want it more affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they do sales all by like
sometimes Farmer Freeman will do a holiday
[SPEAKER_01]: sale and you can get them for 10% off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you buy like 10 tests, you're
basically getting two for free is the math
[SPEAKER_01]: on that I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just buy from Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use to me genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little bit cheaper, but they do
take longer sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pros and cons with both places.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to tell you who I'm
talking to and working with to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: this testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But occasionally randomly, about once
every two or three weeks, I go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: room and I just pick about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one and that one and I'll just
clip off the HLV testing samples and send
[SPEAKER_01]: those in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get them tested randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like testing the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go into the locker room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, bro, you've been playing way
too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to give you a drug test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go test everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything looks slow or sad,
it definitely gets tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been using all the new AC
infinity stuff and everybody looks real
[SPEAKER_01]: happy lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good spot to sneak in a
shameless plug AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you shop with AC infinity.com use
coupon code I re save 15% off your entire
[SPEAKER_01]: AC infinity purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't you AC infinity and I read
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were we HLV testing on the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, so um, and let's we crush and
destroy the seeds at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't really test each seed for HLV D.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can test each parent plant and we can
test populations from the batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, that's the best we've got my
dude Chauncey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me rambling quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox for that
coupon code for a free pack of seeds from

[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I put out a new episode,
you don't miss any of my amazing high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality ganja content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just being goofy today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys I'm in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of great dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends at green dot labs
for keeping me lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got one more good question here in
front of me for today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one also came from the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from my new friend Jerry
Jerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a quick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Hey, are spiders bad in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I have a lady that I keep finding
webs on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I be worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always give a little wash after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does the web actually matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first question is that a spider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a spider in there like an
arachnid big kind of spider that eats
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping an eye on your plants playing
security in there to eat up all the
[SPEAKER_01]: freebies that come around or do you have
spider mites in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of little creepy crawly plant
sucking leeches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have spiders or spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my first question I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Verify can you find the spider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know where the spider is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the difference between and
I'm not doubting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving you solid advice that we
can cover all of our ground here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the difference between normal
spider webs that like a spider would make
[SPEAKER_01]: and spider mite webs that would go across
the tops of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you identify the difference in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be very clear which spiders are
present in the gross spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to take quick immediate action
especially if you're seeing webbing
[SPEAKER_01]: regular spiders.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's up to you my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will say that that spider
like I said a moment ago he's working
[SPEAKER_01]: security.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will not be any other bugs in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be the only bug in the room is
that spider.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll eat everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else wants to come around if he's
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want other bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't want any bugs but one
good spider might work security.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the bouncer at the door making sure
you don't get any riff raff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would identify is it a spider or is
it spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you identify that it is a spider is
it a spider that you're OK with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some spiders you might not want
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know your region of the country
but a brown recluse a black widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to relocate remove that
spider do whatever you do in your humane
[SPEAKER_01]: way that you choose to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would identify is it a spider or
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my first my first plan of
attack here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a spider he's working security
verify that it's a spider then see what
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of spider you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for that web that's gross dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to smoke any of your weed
with spider web in it maybe work on
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping them off the plants do what you
can do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just gross even under whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any food or smokeable
products with spider webs on it just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't make me gives me the makes me
itchy bro is really what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then spider mites if it's spider mites
spider mites are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK we don't want that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get rid of those immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to come up and if you've got
webbing you've got serious spider mites if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to come up with a strategy
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would consider shop backing those spider
might webs off the top if they made little
[SPEAKER_01]: teepees little domes get in there the shop
back suck that right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a rag and hot water you can
use a rag and spray bottle spray those
[SPEAKER_01]: webs down to wipe them right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you do that clean yourself you're
going to be contaminated with spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: all over you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to need to apply either
some aggressive predator bugs or sprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide applications designed to
eradicate spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably one or two pesticides together or
in rotation and go hard and get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: these bad bitches depending on how far
into the progress into the cycle you are
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah if you got spiders it is time to
consider an integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: option step up your game and consider
going hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing we got to do is find
out like I keep saying is is it spiders is
[SPEAKER_01]: it a spider or is it spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we're going to make our big
difference here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a spider you can make your own
judgment call do you want that spider
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you got a cool spider maybe you got
a terrible spider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you feel on spiders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plenty of people would say any spider has
got to go but many people would say that
[SPEAKER_01]: that spider is just fine there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The webbing is gross to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably reconsider that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I keep saying make sure it's not
spider mites if it's spider mites send me
[SPEAKER_01]: another email.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will plan a motive attack because if
you're getting webbing that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said the word spider and spider
mites how about re-listen to that segment
[SPEAKER_01]: every time I say spider take a dab see if
you live through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right my dude Jerry thank you for the
great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies gentlemen boys and girls pimps hoes
friends foes smokers growers clone cutters
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen chukers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a quick episode
because it is the holiday season here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in what I'm calling the holiday taint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not New Year's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot of stuff going on so we're going
to keep it quick keep it short.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to wrap this one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank each and every one of you

[SPEAKER_01]: grow from your heart podcast.

Patreon campaign and what else do we got.

everything is on sale at I redirect dot
[SPEAKER_01]: com over the next few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be doing a short inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the person who helped me with
that inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be an inventory update.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the things that I thought were
sold out there were extra packs left
[SPEAKER_01]: because orders were made and payments
didn't go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or orders were canceled or inventory was
miscounted or shit goes wrong and things
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stuff left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what I found more packs of a few
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will slowly be drifting onto I
redirect dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly there's some big mountain fudge
cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some of the golden girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff that I didn't
realize was in the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is available so I'll be loading that
into I redirect slowly over the next
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days.

[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to ramble here too much at
the end of the show.
