smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need any conversation, any chatter
about growing or smoking any advice about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or smoking any of my strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do highly recommend joining us on the

almost toward the bottom of the I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics website at I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find a spot to sign up for a
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says keep in touch or stay up to date

[SPEAKER_00]: You may not even be hearing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the podcast is not available where you
normally listen when you do catch up on
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fixed I think we fixed pod bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we fit fixed stitcher safe fixed
stitcher a couple of times fast when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we fixed Google podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we fixed all of it but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works on my end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get messages from people with
like an Android phone and they're like hey
[SPEAKER_00]: it still doesn't work and there are
corrections to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will happily make the corrections if
you let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point was big thank you to
everybody for eight thousand subscribers
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get a plaque at 10,000 or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what happens on being
facetious is the word but they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: send us a watch and a trophy and we're
going to have a party at 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also big thanks to everybody for all
of the support on all of the audio
[SPEAKER_00]: servers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do invite you guys if you're only
listening I invite you to come check out
[SPEAKER_00]: the video podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do bust out some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of fancy hand movements come
see the cool backdrop I've got behind me
[SPEAKER_00]: the cool lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enjoy the video at least subscribe on
YouTube so we can get some clicks and some
[SPEAKER_00]: counts for that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough chatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I've got some listener content
some emails and stuff like that to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into that portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Matt and it
goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Rasta Jeff I love your
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just a small time grower running
semi stealth in three tenths.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as stealth as it's going to get
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four tenths makes it not stealth because
the electricity bill gets too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says I want to try to not only
save my genetics but start trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars that will get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a nice buzz with a good head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what he typed but that's what
I'm going to say here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're still in the nice boy clock
if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about the nice boy
clock big fist bump and big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the nice boy clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on it says I want a nice buzz with
a good head high as well as a line geared
[SPEAKER_00]: toward more fighting cancer and
inflammation and pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need something cultivar that will
give you a good head buzz and a good head
[SPEAKER_00]: high and you want something that oh and as
well as fight cancer and inflammation and
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I don't I'm not the expert on
cannabis for cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what you need for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we just mix a bunch of
things together and make an RSO or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said I'm not the expert on cannabis
for cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately I haven't had to fight that
and experience that or deal with that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for inflammation and pain there are a
lot of great strains that will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on it says so I've got kind of
a two part question really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one if I wanted to use some of your
genetics as a base of my seeds after
[SPEAKER_00]: research and selection do I need to seek
your permission and after strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: honed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a two part question in the first
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after the seeds after the strains are
honed would you ever want some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says I'm expecting at least
three years minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years is probably the long track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those F1 seeds will be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me some of the F1's that'll
take 170 days maybe to make those maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: like 120 150 days to throw out a small
batch of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could send me some of those and
they'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main part of the question if I wanted
to use some of your genetics as a base for
[SPEAKER_00]: a few of my seeds do I have to seek your
permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use my seeds and my cross as as
your base but it would be cooler if you
[SPEAKER_00]: used one side of your cross as your base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use the male and the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're going to use a couple of my
females in a different male that's cool
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't use just like my Arise and my
Strawberry Starburst or my I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do two of my things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do Blueberry Butcher and Sunkiss
because those are both mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool but that I could do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of that's like taking a
Ferrari and another kind of Ferrari and
[SPEAKER_00]: just making Ferrari your version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some different sort of work to it to
make it yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate and respect that you love my
work enough to want to put it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding but there's got to be another
breeder out there that inspires you or
[SPEAKER_00]: encourages you and you could use their
work to kind of mix with mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to do both of mine just
for your own personal seed collection
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not a big deal but if these seeds
are going to go anywhere I'd recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use somebody else's line and it
sounds like you're just trying to save
[SPEAKER_00]: your own stuff so you can do whatever you
want with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah though if you're going to market the
idea the etiquette would be to use two
[SPEAKER_00]: different breeders make your own male and
then use that male for breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing your own stuff but it sounds
like you just want to make these for your
[SPEAKER_00]: own stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes in that case bro use mine to do
whatever you want have a good old time and
[SPEAKER_00]: send me some of the F1s maybe I'll work
with those and send you something back or
[SPEAKER_00]: send me some of the F2s and same story
maybe we'll do things you never know maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fall in love with what you sent me
and I'll want to breed to it also and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll end up with some great seeds in
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some great exchanges
happening within the group here lately so
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out to everybody for being so
generous lately also but yes you do have
[SPEAKER_00]: my permission you don't need to
specifically seek my permission to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with my seeds but since you asked about it
you've got my full permission and
[SPEAKER_00]: encouragement and endorsement to breed
with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't invent cannabis I didn't invent
seeds I didn't invent nature whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in if it's Sun Ra if it's Ja
Rastafari if you believe in zoom if you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in water bottle is your god I'm
cool with that you could believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want I have no problem with
that but that's what created seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's who we've got to be grateful
for so I'm breeding with some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: projects we all are I didn't pull seeds
out of thin air I didn't manifest them
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't pop out of my computer screen
I had to get seeds from somewhere and use
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else's either their seeds or
clones to start my growing breeding seed
[SPEAKER_00]: project so I give you my permission to do
the same with my genetics too because I
[SPEAKER_00]: would be arrogant and disrespectful of me
to the entire industry community breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: before me and breeders after me to say no
you can't use my stuff that's a dickhead
[SPEAKER_00]: move I have to treat it like I'm proud you
respect my genetics and appreciate it
[SPEAKER_00]: enough and I'm proud to have made
something and honored that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue my work I've said it before I'm
not gonna live forever I don't want to I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't I'm not planning anything as I ain't
got no fucking plans but I know I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: live forever I'm not gonna do anything on
purpose but I could disappear I could take
[SPEAKER_00]: in a wrong breath right now and this could
be the end of it like right now or I could
[SPEAKER_00]: live another 20 or 30 maybe 40 years maybe
40 or 50 more years after that it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get uncomfortable and we'll have to think
about things but once I'm gone I want the
[SPEAKER_00]: people left to be working with my strains
and I want to have taught them what I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make everybody self-sufficient and if
my seeds are how you get there my podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: my seeds my teachings that's I'm honored
for that thank you then I get to live
[SPEAKER_00]: forever yeah think about Led Zeppelin Led
Zeppelin died years ago right well not
[SPEAKER_00]: ever everybody but parts of Led Zeppelin
most of the Beatles are dead and their
[SPEAKER_00]: music lives on forever that stuff goes
Elvis is dead that's a good example Elvis
[SPEAKER_00]: is dead and people are still listening to
Elvis right now Elvis lives on Elvis is
[SPEAKER_00]: still making more money than most of us
and the dude is dead so I hope that my
[SPEAKER_00]: brand lives on my little stickers Rasta
Jeff stickers and the website and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit I hope that is goes on long after me
luckily YouTube if it works right I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have YouTube won't ever delete the videos
all these videos will be up indefinitely
[SPEAKER_00]: unless somebody fucking flags my account
or something when I'm dead and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't give a shit you guys could deal with
it but yeah I'm not gonna be here forever
[SPEAKER_00]: so I do encourage you to make some legacy
seeds you never know I'm breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: rest in peace I'm breeding with my friend
Subcool stuff Subcool was kind of a mentor
[SPEAKER_00]: and a teacher and an inspiration and an
idol to me Subcool paved the way without
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool I wouldn't be doing it so recently
with Miss Jill's permission I bred with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Jack the Ripper I'm friends with Miss
Jill shout out Jill I hope you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening I hope you're well maybe I'll
see you in February at the Endo Expo you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys don't be weird so I did breed with
Jack the Ripper with Jill's permission
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill was Subcool's what is it a wife with
one time I don't know what you say a widow
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the word the widow so Jill was
Subcool's widow and she gave me permission
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed with his work and I did it to
honor my buddy Subcool so yeah Sub's gone
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're still working with his stuff
giving him paying tribute to him giving
[SPEAKER_00]: him love giving him honor keeping his name
going so since I've bred with stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool my stuff is out there going on
then people are gonna breed to that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then people are gonna breed to that and
then my name will continue Subcool's name
[SPEAKER_00]: will continue will be around for
generations in this cannabis game for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long long time so I do give you my
permission got quite rambling on that one
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about my buddy Subcool shout out
Sub you miss you brother that dude taught
[SPEAKER_00]: me a lot you guys you have no idea some of
the message because sometimes Sub would be
[SPEAKER_00]: like are you a fucking idiot and if you're
like maybe I am dude like what and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: would point point it out that you're kind
of being a fucking idiot he wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid to tell you and then he'd message
you back like I'm sorry brother I was
[SPEAKER_00]: being an asshole like no you're right dude
I was being a fucking idiot I totally was
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad somebody had the balls to say it
Subbie thank you brother and so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah you miss that kind of shit when it's
gone there is a two-part to this question
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rambly thinking about Subbie big
respect Sub you cantankerous fucker I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: the nice boy clock is over then it goes on
it says do you have any kind of classic
[SPEAKER_00]: land-race style genetics to use as a
parent to really create my own library
[SPEAKER_00]: which you would recommend no I don't mess
with land races that is that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother niche what is it alley Avenue of
breeding nerds and I'm being completely
[SPEAKER_00]: respectful when I'm saying breeding nerds
when I talk about breeding there are guys
[SPEAKER_00]: like myself who are passionate about
breeding I love cannabis I love growing I
[SPEAKER_00]: love teaching I love breeding I love
selecting a male and pollinating females
[SPEAKER_00]: and watching how the females react and
then in the end I get to grow those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and watch the seeds and see like if I
pollinated two different females with one
[SPEAKER_00]: male I get to see what that boy added to
the mix and how the female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: represent that male's pollen and how they
express themselves in the progeny and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: completely passionate about growing
cannabis and I'm completely passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding but those land-race nerds
are a step above my passion and a step
[SPEAKER_00]: above my nerdiness they they know so I
know the genetics of what everything I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working with is the grandparents its
parents its recessive traits its dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: traits its flowering time its terps how
much it wants to be fed I know so much
[SPEAKER_00]: about my plants but these land-race guys
they know from which geographical location
[SPEAKER_00]: it came from they can tell you the
coordinates on the globe like well that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from this here and like this part of
Africa and this valley found by this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: from this tribe and I'm like holy shit man
I love it it is beautiful but that is
[SPEAKER_00]: another level of nerd um that I haven't
delved into yet and you land-race nerds
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not being disrespectful by calling you
land-race seed nerds you get what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying I'm a breeding nerd I'm a weed nerd
as well the land-race guys take it to
[SPEAKER_00]: another freaking level it's like there's
uh there's musicians right I'm a rock and
[SPEAKER_00]: roll musician I can read and write music
but that's not my thing let's get out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and just rock and roll play some
four for a classic rock and roll kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit then you got those guys that sit
there with the music in front of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can read the charts and they've got
seven other pieces around them all reading
[SPEAKER_00]: charts and nobody varies one note or one
piece of tempo one tempo shift at all
[SPEAKER_00]: today that's what the land-race nerds are
like they're like the the extra level and
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them I got nothing but respect for
you guys but that is a whole nother level
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know who to recommend for
land-race genetics I have a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that work with that stuff but
they're not really that the land-race guys
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't out there to make a bunch of seeds
for the world they're just doing kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself they're doing their own
closet project because they really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do some crazy breeding and find really
unique shit that land-race breeding will
[SPEAKER_00]: be fun for you that will you'll find some
great shit in there you're gonna find some
[SPEAKER_00]: wild variation some really long flowering
time some unique turps maybe some unique
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profiles that we haven't seen
found enjoyed in a long time a lot of shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been washed away by commercial
cannabis because of specific demands so
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe Google like go to all the
recommended will go to my website here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good here's a good way to start go to my
website then go to all of the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders that are listed on my website
there are eight vendors on there seven of
[SPEAKER_00]: them probably have the opportunity to
offer you land-race genetics the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: vendor only offers iri genetics I know
they're not gonna have land races it's
[SPEAKER_00]: only an iri genetics vendor in Canada
hint-hint you guys there is a Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: vendor on the website now specifically for
Canada you don't have to pay those
[SPEAKER_00]: exorbitant Canadian shipping charges but
go to the website check out the list of
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors click on those open up seven
different tabs you can just right-click
[SPEAKER_00]: open new tab open up all the new tabs you
got all the vendors open up on your on
[SPEAKER_00]: your browser there and then just start at
number one and go to the search bar and
[SPEAKER_00]: type in land-race genetics see what pops
up see what you're looking for do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what land races you're looking for do you
want Brazilian African Mexican Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani there are a lot of great options
do you know what you want do you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to cross together do you know
what some of those common crosses have
[SPEAKER_00]: already been bred to make a lot of the
old-school super popular crosses will be
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Brazilian Thai Afghani cross or
something similar to that and they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled all super crazy it wasn't
bubblegum to magic pony ride to magic
[SPEAKER_00]: mustache to fucking fruity pebbles it
wasn't any of that it was tied to Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: is what they used to be called and they'd
cross the tie to Afghani to a Mexican and
[SPEAKER_00]: then cross that to something else and
that's what they called it Thai Afghan
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican you have a tam or a Thai Afghan
Brazilian and you have a tab but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how it used to be so I would recommend you
go search the websites and then just type
[SPEAKER_00]: in land-race genetics and if nothing from
the recommended breeders on my website
[SPEAKER_00]: gets you any luck then go to Google and
start searching or go to my discord go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord there are a lot of great nerds
there join the general chat join the I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics chat and just type in hey
who your messes with land-race genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe one of my friends has got some for
you maybe we can find you a seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: that's got them but the reason I'm saying
not saying right away go to Google is
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think we can find you trusted
resources by operating through my website
[SPEAKER_00]: my channels my website all those vendors
are credited they've been vetted they're
[SPEAKER_00]: tried and true I know they're reliable
everybody on discord they're cool as shit
[SPEAKER_00]: and if not they get kicked out of the
discord we don't let any dipshits assholes
[SPEAKER_00]: or with a small exception then sometimes
there's some dipshits assholes in there
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've got redeeming qualities
they're only like three to seven percent
[SPEAKER_00]: dipshit or asshole so we let them hang out
there maybe they're funny or something but
[SPEAKER_00]: join us on discord maybe you've got the
opportunity to get some land-race seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I smoke today has got me fucking
stone and rambly and I'm enjoying it I
