[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to episode 457 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we like to start this podcast
off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of watermelon
gelato ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this product
contains 64.6% THC and 76.7% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack the jar open now so we
can give it a little smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the aroma and flavor of
this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately, I am punched in the face by a
sweet watermelon flavor, followed by a
[SPEAKER_00]: light gassiness that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a watermelon, sweet, gassy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dab it, that watermelon flavor
just coats your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you exhale, that gassiness kind of
sticks in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the room is left with a delicious
watermelon candy sort of an aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the watermelon gelato
ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends for the
delicious concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to read an email that came from
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends up north in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of our Canadian
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the email, I would like
to do a few shout outs to our friends on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a giant shout out to
our new friend Victor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a giant thank you shout out

[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I owe a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to my friend Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
guys for your continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there would like to learn
how to support the show on Patreon,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do so by going to www.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to read this email that came
from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I want to talk about something
that I keep seeing in social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, Mike Tyson was quoted saying
that he smokes approximately $40,000 a
[SPEAKER_00]: month in cannabis and cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't think he meant himself
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is him and his entourage
or his crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine what $40,000 in cannabis
products would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cannabis pricing does change
throughout the country and absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Tyson has a ranch in Northern
California where prices were quite stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give a rough guess that for
good quality product in Mike Tyson's area,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's probably paying around $2,000 a pound
for the product he is smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 15, it could be 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on in Cali right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to guess he's paying $2,000 a
pound and he's smoking $40,000 worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 20 pounds of cannabis every month
for Mike Tyson and his crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many people are in that
crew, but they are living it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about that, if you break that
down into retail terms, if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: $40,000 worth of cannabis at $25.08,
that is 1,608.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many eighths do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a flower smoker, how long does
an eighth last you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does a quarter last you?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke by the quarter, that is 800
quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long would that last you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long would 800 quarters last you?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, I'm not sure where you're
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your location, your budget
and the availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most folks tend to smoke about a gram
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven grams a week seems to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: A half ounce a week for some a little
heavier smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the legal states, an ounce a
week is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these people are smoking $40,000 worth
of cannabis in a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could have been a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Mike Tyson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have been just laughing and
telling a joke when he said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people like to speak in
hyperbole, especially stoners,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when we're talking about our
plants and our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a little exaggeration there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that man went on a public forum and
said, we smoke 40 grand in cannabis every
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for a concentrate smoker for me,
concentrates depending on where you shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places it's 30 a gram, some places
it's 50 a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna go with the $40 a gram mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna say that is 1,000 grams of
concentrates in a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I get to smoke 30 grams a day,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to smoke 33 grams of concentrates
every day if we were smoking 40 grand in
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if these guys are smoking concentrate,
they're smoking 33.3 grams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to smoke 30 grams every single
day on the Tyson ranch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many people that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is 10 people, that's pretty heavy
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are 20 people, you're smoking
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got 30 people there, that's about a
gram a day per person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one person's hitting a half a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got a guy like me over there
smoking two grams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got more than 30 or so
people over there, that is not heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just smoking a lot of people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course Tyson does have a ranch
where people come and visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hang out on the ranch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a vacation destination for some
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure that some of that product is
being shared and consumed with his guests
[SPEAKER_00]: and visitors because Mike Tyson is a
polite and kind dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope he's sharing some of that
$40,000 worth of product with all of his
[SPEAKER_00]: friends over at the Tyson ranch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if I had 33.3 grams of
concentrate to smoke today, would you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to come over and give me a hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I can count on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention that because I
thought that was very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that pop up on every social
media outlet available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Tyson smokes $40,000 in cannabis
every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been a headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very amused that that has become news.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into something that we can help
somebody with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work on the email section of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a grow question or a cannabis
culture question, or perhaps you've just
[SPEAKER_00]: got something you'd like to say,
you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will read your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message I'm going to read today comes
from a friend in Canada is does not say if
[SPEAKER_00]: they want us to use their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up to our friend in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am three weeks into my first flower and
I can only wish I had stumbled across your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are an impressive person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of made me shy suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awkward, but I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for listening and learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you find my knowledge
that I share to be impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say the support you show
toward the community and depth of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge is unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the content, but the
delivery is honest and informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me because that is my
exact goal is to deliver in-depth
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that is unparalleled and to have
honest and informative delivery and to
[SPEAKER_00]: sound good and to be a supporter and
leader for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one short sentence there,
you told me that I'm hitting my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say you'd make a good father
if you aren't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am a father and I think I'm doing a
pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kid's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I started in around
episode 351 and it is amazing how much I
[SPEAKER_00]: have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going back to the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you have listened to a hundred and
something episodes and now you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have a very solid
cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to so many shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a bit embarrassing when
you hear my old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not quite the podcaster I have
become now, but you got to start
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So listen to them critique me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't forget that the first 19
episodes of the show are available in a
[SPEAKER_00]: playlist on my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to YouTube search for the grow
from your heart podcast, find my YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a playlist on that channel called
the first 20 or the first 19 episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very long time ago, the podcast was
called something different, but I was sent
[SPEAKER_00]: a letter that said I cannot use that name
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to change the name of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I changed the name of the show,
I created a different YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the old episodes are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: One through 19 are available on a playlist
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't miss those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to catch up in the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even have my brother, his wife and
mother-in-law hooked on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gotten three, four, two,
three other people hooked on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I've worked for 13 years now
as an addiction counselor, and it baffles
[SPEAKER_00]: me the misconceptions with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I completely agree with you
about the misconceptions of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is partly why I do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I sound like a mostly educated
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the highest level of
education, but I am just, what's it
[SPEAKER_00]: called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally intelligent, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a smart dude, just naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to go to school and learn a
bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can convey my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am also a heavy cannabis user and an
advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like coming on here and
speaking mostly articulately, I present
[SPEAKER_00]: myself fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I represent the cannabis
community in a mostly positive light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may not like the fact that I
start the show off by taking a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs and then come on and tell you what
I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well for me, but I feel like
I represent us in a mostly positive light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I speak well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm articulate enough to get
my point across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people don't think I'm just
some stupid stoner when I do the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to come on and do a show that
all of the experienced growers can listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to and be entertained and possibly learn
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to have a show that maybe some
brand new smoker could smoke with grandma
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, Hey, listen to this guy,
grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to teach you some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe grandma could learn about
CBD or grandma can lessen some of her fear
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe grandma's sick and it's time for her
to consider putting some CBD in her diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe my show could be one of the
things that helps break the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring people together,
non-consumers and consumers, believers and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-believers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can bridge that gap by being a
good advocate, a good ambassador,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of taken it upon myself to play
that role in my life, in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, in the cannabis world,
in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big part of what started me
doing the podcast is the misconceptions
[SPEAKER_00]: and the false information that people are
putting on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to speak up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to say, Hey, a lot of that stuff
is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to come do a show that is not
based on selling products or lining
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets or making money for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to come teach you to grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a lot of what led to this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way off topic on a rant here,
but Hey, it's my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to rant about something,
let's get ourselves back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot more to this email that I
cut out because I felt that some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: was personal and I wanted to keep that
between my friend and I, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: catch up where it gets back to where I
want to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got rambly also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, ah, shit, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I appreciate your approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now for my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I built a little grow room in my
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a little grow room in a
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on to say, I used a dryer
ducting with a four inch inline exhaust
[SPEAKER_00]: fan for air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using a four inch, probably a
squirrel cage fan, maybe a little blower
[SPEAKER_00]: and some dryer ducting to duct the hot,
stale air out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say air intake is also a
four inch dryer duct, which pulls air
[SPEAKER_00]: directly from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that probably happens naturally from
the passive air.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you were pulling that air out of the
room with that blower, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking fresh air right in through that
intake because air will travel the path of
[SPEAKER_00]: least resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every bit of air that leaves that
environment does need to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will naturally come in through that
passive vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say being from Northern
Canada, it gets cold as hell here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of an odd statement because I
have always envisioned hell to be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I think about it,
some of the shittiest moments in my life
[SPEAKER_00]: have been when I've been too fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody hates to be too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we've got it all wrong, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe hell is ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have a small space heater that
keeps the room at the desired temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: but will that cold air coming in be an
issue as long as it is not too close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brings up a lot of good talking
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar to the last episode
where the guy was trying to cool his grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of things to think
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were bringing that cold Canadian
winter air directly into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that air is really cold, I may
completely advise against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons why this may
be a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how cold that air is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know as soon as it snows,
it is too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to bring that air into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have some solutions and some
other things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, let's talk about ducting that cool
air into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know if you can do it without
causing problems to the plants if it is
[SPEAKER_00]: too close to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is too close to the plants,
they will definitely get cold and get
[SPEAKER_00]: pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VPD around that area is going to go
haywire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have cold air coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got a fan blowing around that
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a lot of ambient air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a lot of mixing of air
in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are not going to like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are going to create the perfect
environment for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are bringing in wet air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are bringing in cold air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are mixing that with the warm air that
is already in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to create the perfect
condition for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet air plus a warm environment is going
to start powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet air just coming into the room is going
to create powdery mildew situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature swings are going to create
powdery mildew situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that light goes off and you're still
bringing in that cold Canada snowy air,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is going to get cold really quickly in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to promote powdery mildew
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, bringing in that cold air may make
your floor ridiculously cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your Canadian floor is probably
really cold anyway in winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend getting your plants up
off the floor in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want your plants on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want my plants on a concrete
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine waking up out of bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing you do, you got to put your
feet on the cold concrete floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my story, there's no carpet in your
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go straight to the concrete
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put your feet on that
frozen floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing when you wake up, that makes
you grouchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pisses you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how the plants feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be sitting on the cold
floor all day long either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like to elevate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you water them, if they're down
there on that cold floor, you put the
[SPEAKER_00]: water in there, they're even colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're wet and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got cold, wet feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody enjoys that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to get the plants up off the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get the roots warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus more on bringing this cool air
into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about bringing cold air into
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that, but you do have to pay
attention to the temperature of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets beyond 65 degrees,
60 degrees, you may need to warm that air
[SPEAKER_00]: before it enters the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the previous episode, we talked about
treating the room and then introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: that air into the grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you can bring that air into
another area, warm it up, and then dump
[SPEAKER_00]: that air into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have another space that you
can heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you say that you've got a space heater
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine what's going to happen when that
cold air and that space heater start
[SPEAKER_00]: colliding, that hot air and that cold air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like when you go outside and
you do that thing in the winter and you
[SPEAKER_00]: see steam, you were doing that shit and
you're in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that moisture going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to land somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to create powdery mildew
conditions in that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to give yourself the option
for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing we really need to think
about, if you are just bringing air from
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, what else is coming in with that
air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is less likely in the cold winter
conditions that you're going to bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of problems, but there is always
the possibility of bringing in a pest or a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you were a bug and you're
walking by and it's fucking snowing or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about to snow and it's cold and the
sun's going down and out of the corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: your eye, what do you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: That bright white glow of a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that that's warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to buzz right over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fly around the light and
then later you're going to get hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fly down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to look in those plants for
something to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, just maybe that cannabis plant will
be the food that you want and you will
[SPEAKER_00]: start munching on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a little bug, you're nice and
full, you're chilling, got a nice warm
[SPEAKER_00]: spot to live, probably going to want to
find someone to hang out with,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to go on a little quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go out that ducting again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go find some ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to bring them back to the
warm spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make a whole bunch of more
bugs and all those bugs are going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: all over those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start making more babies
and then you're going to have a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of bugs all over your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happens really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That open duct, you've got air coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even have to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just passively float right on in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get blown on in with the
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like body surfing right into your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to have a vent coming
in, I definitely recommend some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover on the end of that ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned on episodes before that
I've seen snakes and shit come in through
[SPEAKER_00]: that ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found lizards in grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found weird shit in grows and I'm
certain that it came in through that
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, it was some sort of voodoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really hope it came in through that
duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a very classic move is to put
some pantyhose at the end of the duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't restrict any airflow and it
will stop bugs from getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sell a really expensive device
called the dust shroom or the shroom cover
[SPEAKER_00]: that just goes right at the end of your
ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very noticeable piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that on your duct,
people on the outside will notice that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use the HEPA filters that
they sell at Home Depot or your local
[SPEAKER_00]: hardware store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a square and it's a filter and
you can cut it to the size you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a staple gun and just staple that
right over the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then run that ducting flush right up
against the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little bit of duct tape around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then anything that comes in or comes out
has to pass through that filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will definitely limit the amount of
pathogens that can pass through your
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are running that ducting in
the winter months and you would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool that air, a good idea that you can
use is to run that air over your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got vented light hoods,
if you've got the kind of hoods that have
[SPEAKER_00]: got a duct on each end where you can put
ducting in and ducting out, what's to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: you from running that cool air in over one
light, over another light to get heated
[SPEAKER_00]: up, then through that blower, then through
your shroom clouds so that you're catching
[SPEAKER_00]: any pathogens or any bugs, then into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a lot of equipment,
but if you insist on bringing that cool
[SPEAKER_00]: air in, that is the safest, most efficient
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your opening for your air
intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your air is coming in
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to say you drilled a four
inch hole directly in the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a four inch hole on the
inside of that wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would staple a HIPAA filter just big
enough to cover that four inch hole,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe an inch around each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little square HIPAA filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would take the ducting and put it
flush against that wall and duct tape it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the wall to where any air has to go
right through that filter, right out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you run that ducting over to the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put it at the end of the sealed
light duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put the other ducting at the end
of the sealed light duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got another light,
repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat for as many lights as you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more the merrier in this process
because now we're trying to heat up the
[SPEAKER_00]: air and we're going to use the bulbs to do
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So daisy chain those bitches up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the end, you've got your blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need your blower blowing to where the
air sucks through all of that ducting into
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very rare case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I want to blow the air
out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time we're sucking the air into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your four inch blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the open end of that, I would put that
shroom dust cover so that anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: made it past that HIPAA filter that goes
over the lights goes down the line,
[SPEAKER_00]: does not make it into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets caught by that shroom filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the warmer months, all you have to
do is take off that shroom filter and spin
[SPEAKER_00]: your blower around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would replace the shroom filter with a
carbon filter at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you are going through the carbon
filter, through the blower and pushing the
[SPEAKER_00]: air out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work to remove the heat and
remove the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've still got your four inch
passive duct bringing fresh air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, make sure you put either that
shroom cover, a cheap HIPAA filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even some pantyhose over that so you
don't bring any crap in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a very affordable and very
effective seasonal grow room adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in Canada, you may be able to leave
it set up for the cold temperature all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but you may need to flip back and
forth occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got the four inch blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running a little bit of ducting won't be a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all you really need is probably a
shroom cover or a HIPAA filter or some
[SPEAKER_00]: pantyhose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you turn it around to blow
the air out, I highly recommend a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to just blow that stink
air right out of the room and laugh at
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody as they smell your skunky aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I certainly recommend the carbon
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is this is all based
on the outside temperature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the air, which you plan on
bringing into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that air is too cold, I would heat it
before it enters the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that air is the right temperature,
go ahead and bring it in, but be sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: filter it in some sort of a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't want to invite bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to invite problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bringing air, we spent all this time
and money to build a really nice grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're just basically going to
knock a hole and invite shit right through
[SPEAKER_00]: that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of don't like that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it is preventable, I would not do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand sometimes we are forced to
work with what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that this grow is in the
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of running that duct from the
outside, can you run that duct into the
[SPEAKER_00]: house so you're just pulling ambient air
from the living area into your grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that air in your living area is
probably more suitable than that Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: cold air outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is also probably less likely to
contain pests or pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another option that you may
explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know your full situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can't put a duct coming from the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably make it look very
inconspicuous since it's just a four inch
[SPEAKER_00]: duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ran that duct into the house
somewhere and maybe put it to where it
[SPEAKER_00]: draws air from either the bathroom or the
laundry room or the kitchen area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could probably disguise it to look
like part of the already existing house
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could look like it is a dryer vent or
maybe an air conditioning vent that is
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people won't even notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people that do notice won't suspect
it's anything new if it looks like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I hope all of those options and
all of that input gave you some useful
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend blowing that frosty
cold Canadian air across those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will bring out some beautiful colors,
but it will give you powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too cold of air blown on the plant will
slow your growth rapidly and you just will
[SPEAKER_00]: not be satisfied with the overall
condition of your finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not say if I can use your name in
