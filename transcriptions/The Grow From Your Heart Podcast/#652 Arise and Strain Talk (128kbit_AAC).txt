[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the love coming, it does keep the
vibe going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble too much,
I think I got rambly in the last episode
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm going to try to keep this one kind
of tight, but every time I say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I jinx myself, every time I say
let's keep it quick and tight and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick episode, that is when I go off the
rails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to keep it kind of quick,
kind of tight in this one because I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure to get this camera and this
camera synced up and edited properly into
[SPEAKER_00]: a proper multi-cam show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what we do, you guys will know
how it went when the show comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm just staring one direction,
something went awry and I got some work to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure it out, you guys,
I'm having nothing but fun learning all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this gear, nothing but fun, it's a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all this tech toys, we live in the
future and it's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I did say I was going to jump
into the second half of the questions from
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend Billy Podunk from the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, Billy did ask why a
golden goat backcross and I took a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of time to explain why a golden goat
backcross, I got a lot of great feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we asked why the story of golden
goat, I talked a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: story of golden goat, then the next
question is can you tell the story of
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker and that does segue into can
you talk about the story of Arise because
[SPEAKER_00]: of course Arise is golden goat and
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is another strain that once
again I acquired from another source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat was a gift from my friend
Pineapple Express, shout out to that dude
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're around, hope you're well
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daybreaker was a gift from our friends
at Gage Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage Green Genetics is another seed
company, they're doing a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually inspired, so I was given the
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inspired a lot of my naming schemes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of strain names with one
word, inspirational or motivational type
[SPEAKER_00]: words are words that they were using for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a strain name called Devotion and
I just felt like when I used their strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that I should put their name into a the
works into the name of the cross to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of honor the name of the plant,
which is why Arise, daybreaker to golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat got a one word inspirational,
motivational, uplifting type feeling word
[SPEAKER_00]: of a name and Arise was the best you can
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker, the story of daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the daybreaker came from?
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from Gage Green Genetics,
very innovative folks in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage Green Genetics, not the other gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other fake gauges out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage Green Genetics has been around for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the OG gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So daybreaker, daybreaker is a chem D
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the chem dog D female pollinated by
a Joseph OG male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know the entire story of the
Joseph OG male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not my OG male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, that was an
OG male gifted to the Gage Green Genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: group or the Gage Green group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's mainly a couple of guys,
Mike and Keyplay that are mainly Gage
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just speaking to the best of my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong about anything with Gage
Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my company, just people that
I've worked with, uh, people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Gage Green is mainly, uh,
Mike and Keyplay and they run Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got off topic of where I was going
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I acquired the, uh, so they got
the Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the Joseph OG male to the best of
my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph OG came from their friend,
Joseph, who unfortunately passed away,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is the story that I was told.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is cannabis legend and story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any verification of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best of what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to tell you the story behind a
strain in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was Joseph who gave the Joseph OG
to our friends at the Gage Green group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gage Green group then use the Joseph OG to
pollinate a chem D, the chem D of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, sought out or, uh, searched out chem
dog strain from, uh, chem dog and the
[SPEAKER_00]: legend of the 13 beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not done the research on chem
dog, and the legend of the 13 beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely recommend that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over the internet somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff you should know if you're
interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our folks at Gage Green group took the
Joseph OG, uh, that's probably an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they pollinated that to the chem D
that made daybreaker seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, daybreaker was a great cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I love the daybreaker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I personally love the daybreaker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple of female phenotypes and of
course I had a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I used for breeding, which we'll
talk about in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female phenotypes had a, uh,
gassy, um, like a fresh rubber burnt
[SPEAKER_00]: tennis ball kind of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you open up a can of tennis balls,
there's a very distinct smell that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out distinct, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got stink in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this smell comes out and it just
smells really, it's a pungent,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, rubbery dry, but pungent smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost got a gassiness sort of a
thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I buy new stickers,
uh, if I get bulk stickers from a sticker
[SPEAKER_00]: printer, sometimes they have a skunky
chemically sort of a smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what a lot of these,
uh, daybreaker phenotypes are smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as cushy and decently,
which makes sense because there's Kush and
[SPEAKER_00]: chem in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got those flavors, but if you don't
know what Kush and chem smell like,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've got to make those up as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like chemicals and burnt plastic
and tennis balls and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful, terrible smells come from their
swampy foot aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirty armpit aromas, body odors,
a lot of that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves on these plants were gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves that were coming from the
daybreaker seeds, uh, the plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could serve fucking dinner on the
sides of these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were dinner plates, which leads into
later on why I chose to use this plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make beautiful purple colors,
but it did have like a, a stretchy sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a structure, just that OG Kush sort of a
thing that OG Kush does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't menorah out like some of your,
uh, more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sought after, uh, just stretchy kind
of shaped plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sought after shape is what I was
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain is really ahead of me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm trying to say,
but my fucking mouth can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes more of a lanky stretchy sort of
a thing, but it's worth it because the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the buds that it puts out are
so pungent and so delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burnt rubber and moth balls and chocolate
and all that chemically stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they're just little dense golf
balls that are so hard and so coated in
[SPEAKER_00]: resin that when you put them in a bag,
like two little nugs as an eighth and
[SPEAKER_00]: people are like, that's not eighth bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put it on the scale and it weighs
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just, it was just such good urban
for the arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I found it and discovered it,
that's when the Kush and the rock buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: the tight dense shit, that's when that was
super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the daybreaker was great for that OG
stank funk stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about daybreaker
was the first question, the story of the
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the inspiration behind
breeding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that that wasn't my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired a package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a tester for the gauge green group
for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they sent me the starlet Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the starlet Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was a tester of that one and I
actually took photos of that and sent
[SPEAKER_00]: those to gauge and they put that,
they didn't put them on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They submitted them to skunk magazine and
a humble brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: My photos of gauge green groups,
starlet Kush was on the cover and the
[SPEAKER_00]: centerfold of skunk magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time when you're looking up
starlet Kush from gauge green group,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those photos, you see will be my
photos with the red background,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with the blue background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big up big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the checking out my photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was a tester for gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I tested a lot of stuff for gauge,
a lot of winners, some things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have told them to put out and he
listened.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they took my, my word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they used what I had to say as input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they didn't just discredit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after testing for them for a long time,
they just started sending me stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got a packet daybreaker and
thought I'm going to grow the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I liked the description,
uh, grew it and found a couple of great
[SPEAKER_00]: females that stuck around for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared clones of those, but I found a
male that was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I'm known for breeding is
very Sativa heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the longer skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of breeding myself into a
box with a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just reading the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon Jeffrey, the golden goat crosses
a lot of golden goat crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all coming out kind of kind of
go in the same direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to try something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I had in mind of making a couple of
bat crosses and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw this daybreaker male with these
big wide fan leaves and these purple
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, and it didn't want to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daybreaker just doesn't want water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can not feed that bitch for twice as
long as all the other plants, not water
[SPEAKER_00]: her and she will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you do water her, the leaves stay
droopy because the leaves were so big that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you water her, the leaves would just
stay there and she looked angry when you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: water her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant wanted it really, really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good trait because that buys
me time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the offspring later possibly
won't need as much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can water it and then actually go for a
couple of days without having to water
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go take a break, go on vacation,
maybe go see fish, maybe go do some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I saw this daybreaker plant and I
saw this male plant and this male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that was coming out when I would rub the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the most pungent, disgusting aromas
coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought this is a breeder plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to breed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was making purple colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making trichomes at a beautiful
shape, a beautiful structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew this dude right here needs to do
some fucking pollen chucking in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them in a room with several
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff never got put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daybreaker crosses, uh, there were
probably when I make a cross, I don't just
[SPEAKER_00]: put one female in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make a new cross,
but why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put seven or eight females in there,
whatever your legal limit, whatever your
[SPEAKER_00]: space limit is, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a lot in there, make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a lot of females in the room at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, um, a Girl Scout cookies plant
in the mint in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one got called coffee cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Girl Scout cookies to daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was, there were a lot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember all of them right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, flow to daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a lot of it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now my inbox is going to blow up,
but, uh, coffee cake, you guys anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'm going to put the golden
goat in there because golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: my selections on breeding, um,
are very important in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very important that I chose good
breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put golden goat in there because golden
goat was so completely different from this
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I want to make daybreaker to
daybreaker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I want to put chocolate,
mothballs, gas, and funk to make the more
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate, mothballs, gas and funk that's
going to come out the same thing or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the breeding is going to be so weird
that those two, all those powerful traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gas, mothballs, funk, chocolate,
tennis balls, all those turps are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet in the middle and they're just going
to cancel each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to come out, smell like
raspberries or something like weird shit
[SPEAKER_00]: like that happens in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would rather do is take this
chocolate funk and mix it into other
[SPEAKER_00]: things like the strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get strawberry chocolate funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl's got cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of similar there, but you
know, you got to cross everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking cookies, uh, the platinum
tangy, because then you get the orange to
[SPEAKER_00]: the chocolate funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm breeding to the lemon skunk,
there is actually daybreaker to lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds really do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but things like that so that I can
make new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to just replicate and
duplicate all the turps that are already
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough, uh, dessert and gas and
fucking Kush kind of smells like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: already cake and fucking Twinkies and
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's already happening everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make some new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to open up my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bottle my bottleneck myself into one
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So selecting this golden goat to the
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew there was going to be some amazing
shit coming out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat, we've talked about her
high potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I breed to the golden goat
comes out highly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, golden goat to itself, golden goat as
a male golden goat, as a female,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything I breed with the golden goat,
it comes out magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I took the daybreaker male,
a beautiful structure, stank ass aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: making purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple trichomes, the leaves were purple,
big giant leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves would turn black and start
crinkling up toward the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took this male and I put them in a room
with all these other girls and in that
[SPEAKER_00]: room was the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some pollen chuck in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have got a golden goat female
pollinated by that daybreaker male that
[SPEAKER_00]: made a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my flagship strains, one of my most
popular strains, a rise tested at,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to say the numbers
without pulling it up somewhere because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody ever believes me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 35.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 84% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown by our friends at organ tica
and Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think miles was in charge of that grow
either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know miles touched it and it was all his
fault that it was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the entire organ tica crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody out there in
Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to New Mexico, uh, cannabis
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What good job you guys, um, where the hell
was I arise arise a daybreaker and golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat cross, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, arise was golden goat and daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that it was going to be a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a bunch of seeds out of that out
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very early on, they were just taking
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was going to most of the other
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I buy seeds from other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pop a lot of other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bred a lot of other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other seeds in that room were just not
doing what arise was doing arise was
[SPEAKER_00]: arising to the occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was fucking taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were boys and girls in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all exploding with growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, think I'm onto something
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched a few of the other crosses
in the room and they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were doing their thing, but that
arise just kept going and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every phenotype I grew of that was a
winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't find one from that batch of
arise that I didn't want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those, the first batch was labeled a,
B, C, D, E, uh, all the way up to G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, uh, a and E were kept around for
a very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: F was around for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've crawled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made F twos of A and E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And F on possibly a couple others that I
don't talk about as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then from another batch, I discovered,
um, number four and number eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are females.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all female, uh, arise crosses
arise F ones that I was keeping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've made F twos with the,
the same male, uh, the Solomon male,
[SPEAKER_00]: the male that's been dubbed Solomon,
but I kept him around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I made F twos of the number eight,
the number four, the number seven E A.
[SPEAKER_00]: F possibly G.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a f*****g guitar chord,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're E A F G.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a f*****g guitar structure,
chord structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I made F twos of a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there were so many good phenotypes
around that I just couldn't, there were
[SPEAKER_00]: subtle differences, but like so many
similarities, some were kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goats, some were kind of more OG
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you smoke OG Kush or chem dog,
you get f*****g high as s**t from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke golden goat, you get high as
s**t.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either buzz was completely desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm sitting on, would end up
sitting on the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'd end up f*****g saying,
I'm going to go sit down and watch TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd end up in the kitchen cooking food
and clean in the basement all at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: f*****g time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, it was just tremendous
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every phenotype had something to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smells were like sweet Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you go wrong with sweetness and
Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then we'll talk about the arise male
who was known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a boy in that batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually Fino hunted a boy out of that
batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through several seeds looking for
the perfect male because I knew I just
[SPEAKER_00]: knew there was a male in that batch of
seeds that was going to pass on the magic
[SPEAKER_00]: that I saw in that original cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first grew that first batch of F1
arise seeds, I saw them like they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They f*****g kicked the soil out of the
way and they came out screaming like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: f*****g here and we're going to grow and
you cannot stop us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, holy s**t, these plants
are onto something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they were all boys because
usually male plants grow with that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor, but these female and male plants
were all just taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to make that vigor continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found a few of my favorite female
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, if I'm going to
pollinate something, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate a whole bunch of f*****g
somethings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found my daybreaker male and I put a
bunch of ladies in the room and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: started pollinating things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got probably, I want to say that King
Solomon, um, is probably responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly a hundred crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, uh, 50 of them have been
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably maybe close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but that daybreaker
pollinated the golden goat made a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rise was I selected a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been called Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read about King Solomon,
uh, ladies were his weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have had anything he wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted a lot of ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought my male plant should be named
Solomon because he's got a lot of kids
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, just like Solomon did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's some rasta s**t right there for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A peek into, into my little rasta brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that is the story you guys of
daybreakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is not really my story to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another breeder story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you my, uh, my experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it came from the gauge green
group, uh, came from Mike and key play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the seeds because I used to be a
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not test the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not have bred with it had I tested
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was already out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was given as a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free rain on breeding with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you should breed with the
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I f*****g saw great potential in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something about, um,
like a cannabis matchmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see two plants, I'm just like,
dude, these two plants, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, f*****g those people with matchmaking
services or date makers or hook her up
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever have friends that are trying to
hook up to your friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yo, bill and Susan should date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they do, and they hit it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, how the f**k did you know
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that I'm that kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that should, I know that if plant a
and plant B do the, uh, the horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: mombo, I know that their kids are going to
be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm at an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of cheating at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that my male plant Solomon is
f*****g magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that old Saul touches,
he's going to turn into magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just got the magic f**k and he's got
the Midas touch, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he pollinates female plants and the
offspring is just f*****g awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, uh, I've got access to some of the
most elite female plants on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got access to a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends that will acquire or get
me things.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I ask, uh, I can get whatever I
want you guys and people, uh, return me
[SPEAKER_00]: clones of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I breed something and they grow it and
they find something stellar, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times people offer to return me a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking more people up on those
offers so that I could do some more,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, reversals and some different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I've got female clones,
female plants that have been tried,
[SPEAKER_00]: true tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been through the ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a lot of experience in the
commercial, uh, cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what is it industry here in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been to a lot of commercial grows
and I went to a lot of them for extended
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go to this one place for maybe a
four to eight, maybe a 12, 16 week
[SPEAKER_00]: contract, uh, maybe a two harvest,
full complete harvest contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to see their plants for two full
harvests once or twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, by then you learn that plant sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one right there talks to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant right there says something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get a clone of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somehow we managed to get me a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it in my fucking personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get rid of all the problems that came
with that clone because it came from that
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary grow, clean it up, breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And voila, we've got another magic
ingredient to make more magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants have been vetted and tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am kind of cheating, but I know that
I've got successful breeding plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the story of a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: She tests super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a full podcast about a rise,
but I do enjoy kind of revisiting because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been years since I did that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode definitely wasn't a video
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a rise eats very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rise gets pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she takes well to defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can handle high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, right now it's probably kind of hard
to get a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not a lot of seeds left,
especially after this episode airs,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will sell out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not already sold out, uh,
seeds here now.com also check out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.com for a list of vendors
and opportunities where you can find a
[SPEAKER_00]: rise, not just a rise, but all of the
strains that I'm putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to wrap up the podcast,
but since I'm teasing out, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: teasing strains that I'm putting out
coming soon, you guys, if you've listened
[SPEAKER_00]: to this far into this ramble cast of an
episode coming very soon, two new strains
[SPEAKER_00]: from I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been watching social media,
you may have seen me test these a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people out there are testing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for some photos from other
great testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say fall, maybe winter of this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not early next year, I do need to make
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes time and it's, it's honestly
just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to package it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to get it going, but they're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about two new strains coming
from I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to announce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use camera two for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to
announce the names of a couple of strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've been teasing and hinting at you,
uh, for quite a while there's a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, uh, which one do we do first?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I have taken a biscotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the biscotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biscotti is an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super dense bud, uh, pastry flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called biscotti for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, double door dank
for throwing me that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biscotti has been pollinated by the
arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is biscotti to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that King Solomon arise cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants put off confusing aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like skunky pastries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like chemical pastry electrical fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a pastry and crayons or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really crazy smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that one is called Saka souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get Saka souffle more power to
you, if you don't get Saka souffle,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just, you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain will still grow for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other strain that I want to
announce the name of, uh, I was gifted a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of the chem de la chem that is Chem
D, uh, it is Chem D crossed to the I 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from, uh, JJ from top dog
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know how much I appreciate JJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great breeding, great plants, uh,
great parent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding is always going to be
solid with that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's not going to put out anything
that isn't fucking stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken the chem de la chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I pollinated that one as
well with the King Solomon cut of my
[SPEAKER_00]: arise, the male, the popular King Solomon,
the popular arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that one is called the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got Saka souffle and the machine
coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, Saka souffle is biscotti to
arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machine is chem de la chem to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, both are wonderful strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pass my testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, great plants, good vigor, good
potency, good Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they qualify to be in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They qualify to be in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all the test growers who
helped me out to get these strains out to
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, wonderful test growers, wonderful grow
reports, great photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be offended if you have not been
selected as a test grower yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always new shit coming,
uh, pandemic year slowed down a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, maybe next year you'll get an
opportunity to be a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those tester applications coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a full podcast about being an
irie genetics tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do still have them on file.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not delete them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a folder in my Mac book called,
uh, tester applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there when I need testers,
I start at the top and just start reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a few set to one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a big pile to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have a reject pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day I'll email you and go,
Hey, you grow any more plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do any better?
[SPEAKER_00]: You make any changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's new in your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get the opportunity to be a
tester at that point, but don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: discouraged if you haven't been selected
as a test grower for irie genetics yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The future is wide open.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen,
