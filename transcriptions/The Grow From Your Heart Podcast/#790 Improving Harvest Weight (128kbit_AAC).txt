[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 790 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to give away a
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've teamed up with our friends at seeds
here now.com to give away a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that later in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go too far, I do want to
announce that irie genetics will be at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send another big shout out to
our friends at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was back at comedy works over the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see Ari Shafir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw Brian Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the show was hosted and
emceed and opened by none other than Sam
[SPEAKER_00]: talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of the performers were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody at comedy works treats miss
dread vibes and myself like royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all of the comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of the comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the staff at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course a big shout out to miss
dread vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy works doesn't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have so much fun going there that I
do need to give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that some of the crew listens
to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big fist bump, big love to the whole
crew at comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's segue into the email and grow
question portion of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I said that if you
sent me a grow question on the grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: tab on my website, I said, if I read that
question here on the podcast, you would
[SPEAKER_00]: win a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my new
friend Stewart for sending me a great grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also congratulations, Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to send you a free pack of
seeds because I've read your, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: read your question here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big shout out to Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to seeds here now.com
for sponsoring the seed giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stewart has won a free pack of iry
genetics beans to go along with his
[SPEAKER_00]: already packed garden of iry genetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from the grow help tab on
the iry genetics.com website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to iry genetics.com on the top,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a part that says questions click
right on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will bring down a list of questions
that I want to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically says, uh, what kind of
question do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you growing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask a few basic questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can answer your question with
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to iry genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of tabs on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that says questions click
right over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will bring up this form, fill this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read that question on the podcast,
you will also win a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this giveaway does expire at
some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I decide, I haven't determined
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever the sponsorship and the deal
ends, it ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, send me your grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may win some free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats to our friend Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stewart's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what strains are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stewart is growing a nice buffet of
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we've got cherry Garcia,
early berry, grandpa's cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, spice and strawberry banana,
uh, more that he can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some new town in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy duty fruity to aphrodisiac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterglow testers, the prize scarlet
begonias, lady marmalade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he said all by the man,
the myth, the legend Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing a nice buffet of great
genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, where are you growing these?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are being grown indoors under led
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a lot of questions here that
don't really pertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already read the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these details don't pertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to skip some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get right to the technical
part of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start out by saying I'm a big fan
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been listening since right before
the vid bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for jumping on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of new, uh, listeners and
subscribers right around the vid time.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, if you haven't already
subscribed, do hit that subscribe button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out there, there's a lot more to
this, but then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm a big fan of your gear,
ran a few strains and already I have more
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my problem is that my overall
dried and trimmed weight is not to my
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's growing a bunch of great genetics,
but the overall finished product doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: weigh enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting enough finished product
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, we do have more details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says in veg, I have a 600 B spec and a
150 R spec covering about 40 seedlings and
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 veg in three gallon homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the flower rooms, I have a 40,
I have 48 three gallon plants under two,
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 R specs and one 350 R spec Diablo,
which are all HLG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are good lights, but that's a lot of
plants, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the other flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he describes the other room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says I'm using new millennium
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should work well for you at the
recommended dosage, along with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, H and G root accelerator and Epsom
salt at a low dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on and says, I don't test my PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also just put four weeks, but I have
everything from seedlings to plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: week nine, a flower and everything
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he says I am supplementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, anyway, I never did a true
phenol hunt and my plants dried and trim
[SPEAKER_00]: weight goes from 16 grams of plant to 38
grams of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a, there are a lot of plants in
this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yield is less than half a less than a
pound and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have lost track with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says I've lost track with the plants
that are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when they flower, I can tell anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I start tracking in veg when I
clone and the next harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is kind of worded a little bit
oddly, and I'm reading it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Says I need weight to cover the cost and
so forth, or is there something I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: missing or messing up or any other
suggestions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Please feel free to read this for a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of details that I'm going
to skip in here and this question,
[SPEAKER_00]: but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's also a lot of stuff that I can
explain very quickly, just from the little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit that I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend sent a lot of pictures here of
this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that I noticed is that
there are, in my opinion, I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to disagree, but in my
opinion, uh, there are just too many damn
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're trying, you're kind of with all
due respect, and I understand this because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guilty as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're being a plant hoarder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've got too many different strains
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, you got too many different
plants and really from reading what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: telling me in this one paragraph,
you don't have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have a strategy,
if you don't have a roadmap, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to the destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get to the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I would do,
I would minimize some of those plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: every room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are too many plants in every room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every room, the plants are way too close
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they look so tall and stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of, there's not a lot of
growth at the bottom part and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: really stretched out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you've cleaned up the
bottoms in a lot of those photos,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they wouldn't be so tall and stretchy
if you spread them out a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're too close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of, uh, getting tight nodes
and developing the way they should,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're stretching to get up to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's just so many of them crowded
together instead of being able to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out and go, Oh yeah, I'm living the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going, Hey, is there some light up
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just trying to reach up as
hard as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're frustrated with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like to me from the
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's simply cause you're just
packing too many in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it sounds like a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think the more plants in there,
the more product I'm going to produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is a point of diminishing
returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've hit that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, I would remove at least one row
along the outside, one row along the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and the whole square you've got,
and just use all that space to spread them
[SPEAKER_00]: out that much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would minimize a lot of plants in that
room, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are too many plants that are
stretching and they're competing for space
[SPEAKER_00]: because the lower leaves are not getting
any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you've had to clean up all the
bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to keep happening as tall
as they get the more tall, the taller they
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, they're just going to keep shading
each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just going to keep stretching
more to get taller and taller and tall
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are great, but you want plants that
fill in and produce a lot and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not setting yourself up for
success from the beginning at the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already getting behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are already getting stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good foundation, a good
structure to have a good weight producing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing I would do, I keep saying
this too many damn plants in all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got a lot of plants in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed hoarder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a plant hoarder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to grow as many as will fit in the
damn room that I am legally allowed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I stuffed the room, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it, but you've got to get rid of
some of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they're too close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one thing I noticed in your
pictures, there are no fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no air movement in any of those
rooms, which is also why the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting tall and stretchy and spindly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put some air in there, some air
movement, blow the plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a little stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be so thin and wispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a little bit thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will produce bigger, fatter buds,
a better harvest, a better yield in the
[SPEAKER_00]: long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also they're not popped and twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's really done to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're topped one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they spread out and then you
defoliate and clean up the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: shave the legs a little bit, but there's
no popping and twisting done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spread them out a little bit,
top them, pop them and twist them and put
[SPEAKER_00]: some fans on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give you bigger,
beefier, stockier, more robust plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to veg for a little bit
less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll still get big fat plants and you
won't need as many in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, work a little bit on the popping
and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've saw that I saw that the one room
in veg was heavily defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably wouldn't defoliate that much in
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is where you're getting the
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait a little bit more until the
flowering phase, early flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: mid flower to do that default,
that heavy defoliation that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still pull leaves, but you're
going kind of hard in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, based on the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got too many plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're too close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd spread those bitches apart,
get some wind on them, pop them and twist
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard the episode about
popping and twisting, where you just,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I'll show you kind of with this
microphone a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this were the main stock of the plant,
I would start at the bottom right where it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in school and we tried to pick
who, uh, goes first at baseball,
[SPEAKER_00]: who bats first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you grab it down here and then you put
the other hand up here and the other guy
[SPEAKER_00]: goes like this and like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you do that, just twist
opposite directions and pop the cellulose
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll sound like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll sound like that sound just like I'm
popping a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call it on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop the knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that we'll slow down that
vertical growth vertical, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow down the vertical growth of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll also make the branch get a little
bit more robust and a little bit sturdier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That more robust, sturdier, thicker plant
is going to produce bigger, fatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: juicier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to make your stocks a
little stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that I would definitely
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, less defoliation and more fans is how
I would start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, then something I want to talk about
is you said that you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the new millennium nutrients with a
couple of additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using any bloom boosters?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the new millennium is
great, but I like to add something for a
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use something that is very
affordable and very effective in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, I think that bud swell works very
well with the new millennium mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add some bud swell in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, add that around week five,
week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I really like a product called
shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if I'm growing smokeable flower,
a lot of what I grow is for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing smokeable flower,
I put a lot of shine in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that puts bulk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts weight to the product and it puts
a lot of trichomes and a lot of funk to
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the bud swell and some shine and
then a kelp product with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and then also don't forget about the,
uh, the Ruby new millennium doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor me or pay me, but I think Ruby's a
great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that five milliliters per gallon with
every feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll make your feed more
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bloom booster, do you have some sort
of a bloom booster in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to push it, something to make it
go shebang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've got all the, uh, all the gas in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything to make it
turbocharged?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to turbocharge this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not getting enough, we got to
turbocharge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower that you posted a picture of
looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You posted some very, uh, beautiful,
very colorful flower that looks really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking we may need just to boost
these up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The topping looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would work on some sort of scrogging or
some sort of trellis system, or maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have less plants in there and I
would spread them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make the plants get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they would get B beefy fat buds,
which are going to need supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would work on some sort of a scrog
net or some sort of trellis or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato cages, or maybe just a bunch of
sticks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, be very careful,
but I would recommend something to support
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they don't have to spend all of
their energy holding themselves up and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can use more energy producing
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also strain selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you haven't done any pheno
hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think strain selection is going to be,
um, a big deal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got plants in there that are not
putting the weight you need, definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: remove those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got plants in there that bang
out the weight you need, put more of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a no brainer there,
but that comes from a good pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also comes from not getting too
attached to those plants that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: performing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be beautiful, but sometimes we've
got to call those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to hit numbers and pay
the bills, you can't get too attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to remember that you've got to
pay the bills, get rid of those low
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding, low quality plants that do not
produce that don't reach your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strain selection, uh, less strains in
there also less strains overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would dial it down to like
maybe two maybe three strains per flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can learn the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got too many plants in that
room, how are you going to know that this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant likes a little bit more nitrogen and
this plant doesn't like so much Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_00]: and this plant would like it a little bit
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never find that out because you've
got to run that baseline room all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: with no adjustments, no changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would eliminate it to your few
favorite plants and then really build a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship and dial it in with a few
cultivars in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can definitely max out and reach the
potential and reach the goals which you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're dating too many ladies in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to learn one of them to
make one of them fully satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be juggling to keep all
those ladies happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to focus on one and make that
one lady super happy and you will both win
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, one of my pieces of advice is to
just minimize the amount of plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: variety in there and dial it in,
build a relationship with a cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn that cut and maximize the shit out
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, CO2 may help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you have CO2 in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much CO2 you're using,
but bang that shit out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it up, get more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then here's something that I really
think will help you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a little bit of a strategy,
a little bit of a plan, a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule, a little bit of a goal,
a little bit of a standard operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure would really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sounds like you're,
um, you're growing, you're making flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making product, but you're doing it
kind of willy-nilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, uh, write down when I picked
these clones, I'm going to veg them as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be in the clone stage for
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put them into small pots for three
weeks and the bigger pots, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them veg forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four weeks after that, then we flower them
for nine weeks, set a timeline,
[SPEAKER_00]: decide how tall into veg you're going to
let those plants get, start setting some
[SPEAKER_00]: goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then definitely start writing down when
you put, when you cut the clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you put it into veg, when you put it
into flower, start writing down what you
[SPEAKER_00]: feed, how often you feed it, create
repeatable results by creating a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedure and by keeping notes
and then keep the notes of what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what came out good, see what came out
bad, and then repeat what was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do what was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you've got the right idea as
a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely looks like you know how to
take care of plants, how to transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: things, how to build a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it looks like you have a good
understanding, but I think you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, just a little bit of like a drill
sergeant in there just saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: what did you do in here, soldier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like write this shit down, soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on a schedule, soldier, clean this
shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just need that person over your
shoulder and make that person you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the only one in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be accountable for that
sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, get on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying this, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm really OCD about, I know I've got
clones in a cloner right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got small pots somewhere right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got bigger pots somewhere right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pollinated room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I open up my notebook in those rooms,
I know when each thing happened in that
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the last feed was in each of
those rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when the harvests are going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, knowing when the next harvest is going
to happen allows me to know when to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: clones for the harvest two cuts behind
that, because I've got the harvest coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going and as soon as the harvest comes
down, the veg plants go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to get cuts so that I've got
those veg plants ready to go once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a good tight schedule written
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly when that shit needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically, uh, when these clones go
into these pots, these cups go into these
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and they're going to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the first, the old pots that were
in there going, cause I do it in two
[SPEAKER_00]: stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn your rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually you'll be able to create a
perpetual cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got two rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have mother plants,
clones, small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you should have veg lined up to
go into each flower room, or at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: veg in that room for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to create a great rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just plan a strategy and know these
plants flower for nine weeks, that means
[SPEAKER_00]: that every nine weeks, I need to have more
plants ready to go into this room,
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how long to veg, when to cut
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a two week clone cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got seven more weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got three weeks in a small pot,
four weeks in a big pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go into flower, repeat that
process, dial it in, learn the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: learn the process, learn the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will start big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banging out the weight that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend, the overall diagnosis,
the prognosis, uh, my, my assumption in
[SPEAKER_00]: there is I think you're just packing way
too many plants in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it sounds like more
plants equals more weight, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: always equal more weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It equals more fluffy bud because all of
the plants are competing for that light
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's like trying to feed a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could feed a hundred people,
uh, the same amount of food every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have a bunch of skinny
people walking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it down to 70 people,
those people get that much more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get a little bit thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start, unfortunately we can't just go
cut out people, but just see what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it down to 50% of the people,
they get fed twice as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to thrive, get bigger,
build some muscle, kick some ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I'm recommending
happens in this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also take those fucking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, definitely get a schedule,
take some notes and get some, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy going, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a notebook, get a calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got Google devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take notes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need some help and want some
guidance on that, please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be more than happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could do a full episode on how to
set up some schedules and take some notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also add those bloom boosters,
that bud swell, uh, the shine,
[SPEAKER_00]: some kelp products, and definitely use
that fulvic acid if you are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, I rambled on quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I rambled on long enough about
that one.
