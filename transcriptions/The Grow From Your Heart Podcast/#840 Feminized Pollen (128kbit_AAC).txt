[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Saturday, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this episode
Saturday, June 1st, today is the day of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to the Dude Grows Cup and
you hear this message before the event,
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to stop by my booth and tell
me that you saw a turtle in the clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to the booth and tell me that
you saw a turtle in the clouds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you a free gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 840 of the Grow From Your
Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I've got another great episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out, we'll talk more about those free
seeds later on in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you that by the time
this episode comes out, the Golden Girls
[SPEAKER_00]: bundle will be live on ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you go to ireadirect.com,
you can get the new Golden Girls bundle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does come with four strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three seeds of each strain in
that bundle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get 12 feminized seeds total in the
Golden Girls bundle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is Blanche, there is Rose,
there is Dorothy and Sophia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information is on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit ireadirect.com to grab the fresh
Golden Girls drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I think that is all of the
advertising I want to do here at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a quick episode because I am a
little focused, a little excited about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got a couple of days here until
the cup happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going in real time, I'm at the
cup right now while you're listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't want to blur the Terminator
timeline here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the question and answer
portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets confusing sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about this for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main seed sales website is ireadirect
.com if you're strictly looking for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: iredirect.com is the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find more info,
more details, if you want to find a link
[SPEAKER_00]: to my Discord server, my Patreon,
my social media, there are a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: great links that are available at
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the other website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is hosted at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, the Discord server,
the Patreon server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a link to join my
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you scroll down to the bottom of the
page, there's a spot that says stay up to
[SPEAKER_00]: date or keep updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put in your email address and join
the newsletter, every time I put out a new
[SPEAKER_00]: drop or put on a sale or do a special
event, you will get an email giving you a
[SPEAKER_00]: heads up on those drops and special
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you never miss a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never miss a sale, never miss a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, all of that info is at iregenetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on that website is a tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tab does say grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a grow question and you need
help in your garden, you can go to my
[SPEAKER_00]: website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you the opportunity to send
me a grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send your grow question through
that grow help tab and I read it here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast, I will send you a coupon code
for a free pack of seeds off of iredirect
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's first question from that grow help
tab came from my new friend, Dennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Dennis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Dennis, make sure you check your
email and check your spam because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a coupon code for a free pack of seeds
from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, Yo Rasta Jeff,
can you take clones from your female seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: once they grow and will they still produce
good weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there's a lot of things to
think about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly what you mean,
but let me observe and think about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different directions this question could
be going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take clones from female seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you asking, can we clone a feminized
plant that came from a fem seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a female seed, is that clonable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely clone that fem seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you can clone any cannabis
plant other than an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend cloning an auto
flower, but you can clone almost any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant out there if you do it
properly, if you do it with a good
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedure to avoid any
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the donor plant is healthy and happy,
yes, you can clone just about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, once they grow,
so can you clone your female seeds once
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean like while it's in veg,
can I clone it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put it into flower, can you clone
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can if you do it strategically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take the tops, take stuff from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely clone that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a couple angles I'm thinking the
question may come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clone the fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clone them while they're in veg or
early flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, will they produce good
weed still?
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is all done properly, the donor
plant, the mother plant, which the clone
[SPEAKER_00]: came from, if your timing is right,
if your technique is right, that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: will still produce quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clone that you took, if you did it
properly, if you veg it properly and take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of it, it will still produce a
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should be clones of the original
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that original plant was any good,
that second plant, that clone should also
[SPEAKER_00]: be equally as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of different things
here that are open to interpretation in
[SPEAKER_00]: this question in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I've covered most avenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you clone your female seeds once they
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume you mean feminized seeds or just
a female plant in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clone that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it grows, I'm not sure if you mean
like once it gets big enough to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: take a clone of or if you mean once it's
in flower, but either way with strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: with location and timing and being careful
and not giving any stress to that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's undue, then yes, you can clone
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And will they produce good weed still?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that's up to you, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a quality grower, if you provide
all of the quality parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant should be able to give you a
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Dennis, thank you for
the quick question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds from IriDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, a lot of people have these weird
misconceptions about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear things like, can I breed to a
feminized plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed to lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon jeffery is feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hit lemon jeffery with multiple
different kinds of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that comes out of that has been
fucking stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problems there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed to your femme plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clone your femme plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mother out your femme plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just like all of the other plants
that you work with, except they were
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference was the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my theory, it's my opinion,
it's my experience, my education,
[SPEAKER_00]: my research leads me to believe that the
feminized aspect, the sex of your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly comes from that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say 99% of that comes from the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the decision is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it even hits the female plant,
that pollen knows if it's a boy or a girl
[SPEAKER_00]: and when it hits your female plant,
the decision is already made.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play with those feminized plants just like
you do any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one touches on the topic that I'm
rambling about a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my new friend,
Just Ken.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Just Ken?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds from ivorydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, when those coupon codes come with an
expiration date, they really do expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, hey, does this
expire?
[SPEAKER_00]: On this expiration date?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that means, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to put an expiration date on those
coupon codes basically for bookkeeping and
[SPEAKER_00]: logistic purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have coupon codes out
there floating forever and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody decides to redeem them in three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work for a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do give them an expiration date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it encourages you to shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's good forever, it'll just sit
there, go buy some shit, then grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message, once again, from Just Ken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, hey, Rasta Jeff, thank you for
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are truly an inspiration and a wealth
of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this podcast for,
I think I said 10 years recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love giving this information to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love spreading the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I didn't teach,
if I didn't share this, it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: disservice to the community and to what I
believe in that blessed me with this
[SPEAKER_00]: skills and ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to come out of me or I may
spontaneously combust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing that I am an
inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome to hear and a
wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've got a quick question about
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like talking about pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says when you reverse a whole or part
of a female plant, I've noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing part of a plant, sometimes it
doesn't work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to you got to spray the whole
fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just works so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there and reverse that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll stay on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you reverse a female plant,
will that pollen always make feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it wraps up with I'm finding a
lot of uneducated information about this
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're going to we're going
to touch on this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, is fem pollen always fem pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer to that and shout out to J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get more feedback from J.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the female plant that you are using to
make that pollen, that female plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are choosing to reverse, if that is a
solid female that does not have intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, then yes, that pollen will always
be female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is like a one somewhere between and
this is this is a very wide range,
[SPEAKER_00]: but somewhere between one in one hundred
and one in a million chance of something
[SPEAKER_00]: going weird with that feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you chose a solid female,
nature is going to do weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your pollen donor, maybe your pollen
receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when two specific plants hit,
you're going to see some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get an intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find a pure male come out of
somewhere of those feminized plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, that's one in a million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be up to one in a million
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it what I think two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a male come from a feminized
seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another breeder out there a long
time ago we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ninety nine point nine percent of the
time, if you did it correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the selection was done properly,
then yes, that pollen will be feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be red pollen because
there are no male chromosomes present in
[SPEAKER_00]: the female plant that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking all X chromosomes and you
are making pollen from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't there unless it's introduced
through that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen will all be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do reverse a plant that is pure
female, it will always produce female
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, feminized seed pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says also does reg or auto pollen make
a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reg and auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference there is reg or and
you mean photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't mean reg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked over that word also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period or auto period pollen make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if it's that it'll do what it's going
to do, though, just keep in mind if you
[SPEAKER_00]: use auto flower pollen on your regular
plants, some of your progeny will also
[SPEAKER_00]: come out feminized auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you start making auto flower
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, that part doesn't make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminizing reversing is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using autos or photo period
plants, my notes that I wrote on the page
[SPEAKER_00]: were fem pollen is fem pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have reversed a plant made female
pollen, that is female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, like I said, if you reversed an
intersex plant, if you reversed a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite, that genes or that pollen
will have those genes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant will produce more intersex
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, that's a whole other side
rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last note was unless one parent is
intersex, everything will be over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the question is, will pollen will
fem pollen stay fem pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way for it to change sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will happen with your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if disclaimer, once again, if that is a
true female that you've chosen to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: or reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, my buddy Just Ken,
make sure you check your inbox because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a coupon code for a free pack
of seeds from iri direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep this momentum going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got another message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In front of me, this one also came from
that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from my new friend who wants to
be called Black Forest Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Black Forest Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question says, hey, Rasta Jeff,
I've got a question, possibly a multi part
[SPEAKER_00]: question about changing the timing of my
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being somebody who's grown for so many
years and had to make so many changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand this exact situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got some good solid advice for
you, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get that far, let me remind you
to check your inbox because you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds from
iri direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys make sure you check your spam
because a lot of times those do go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: spam box.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, so instead of the lights
being on during the day, they will be on
[SPEAKER_00]: at night to help me get around heat
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a very smart idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently this listener has their grow
lights on during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to flip that and run the lights
at night because you don't have to compete
[SPEAKER_00]: with the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as hot at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets naturally cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier to cool the grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, electricity is cheaper at off peak
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be saving a few bucks there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to run as much AC and the
AC that you do need to run doesn't cost as
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stay focused, which is hard for
me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says now, now that it's getting warmer
here, I could skip that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to lower my power bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be more beneficial to let the
ladies have a one off 24 hour darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: period before their schedule change or
change the night shift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that quick change to night shift
throw them away off of their natural
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles that I've developed while flowering
and stress them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And could the amount of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip this second part and
just get right to the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy, black forest
gardener, it does sound like you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the right idea here by trying to give
these plants an extended dark period
[SPEAKER_00]: before flipping that timer, because if you
wanted to go, so let's just say that the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights come on at nine AM now,
they go off at nine PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to just flip them back on,
that would give them 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part of the question is,
does the age of the flowering plants
[SPEAKER_00]: really have a lot to do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I would not do that to my
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you the opportunity for
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives them a full day of lights on
with no rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to give them sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will confuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got the right idea by doing
the extended dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's touch on one detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you time this properly, you said 24
hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if those lights come on at nine AM,
and then they go off at nine PM,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you give it 24 hours from there and
turn it back on at the next nine PM,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, then you'll be back on when the
lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be seven PM, eight PM,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using nine as my number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when mine happened is nine AM and
nine PM is what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works good for my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so if they come on at nine and go off
at nine, pull that plug when they go off
[SPEAKER_00]: and then let nine PM come back around and
then turn them back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you do have the exact correct idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do think that that short break of
light will be much more beneficial than
[SPEAKER_00]: extended light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants really prefer extra dark over
extra day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine, and this is something that I
talk about every time I talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupting light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if this were you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you woke up one day at nine PM
and the sun was up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would freak the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nine PM and the sun is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if nine AM came and it was still a
little cloudy and a little dark outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and I said, hey, bro, you don't have to
get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could sleep a little bit extra today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd curl up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd snuggle in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get a few more hours of sleep and
you would enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I put that sun up at nine PM and
woke up your sleep, you'd probably freak
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants feel the exact same way about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them extra sleeping time,
they're OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you turn off the lights when
they're sleeping, just like you,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to get a little bit pissy
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I'm not skipping anything
with the second half of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, would it change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And could the amount of time they've been
in flower affect them?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may make a small difference,
but I still wouldn't mess with them that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still be as gentle, gentle,
gentle as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I grow perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shutting down is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have plants in various stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that 24, 24 hours from when they turn
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let them skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them have their off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them have their daytime that they
would normally get, but don't turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then nine PM, kick them right back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be right back in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Black Forest Gardens,
thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really hope that this works out for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit booters and skateboarders,
all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank each and every one of
you once again for listening to a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this episode was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've got ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited because the Dude Groves Cup is
happening and I got a few more things to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish up before I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to get out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you see me at the Dude
Groves Cup, make sure you stop by the
[SPEAKER_00]: booth, say that catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get a free gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're wearing irie merchandise,
if you've got a t-shirt, a hat,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hoodie, come by the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also get another prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll just combine prizes,
give you a bigger prize, but come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say that catchphrase, if you're
wearing merch, if you don't want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: either one of those, just stop by and say,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a selfie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you high fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm outgoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop by the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you guys to come next week
and type shit like, Hey, I saw you at the
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC Cup, but you looked busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't say hi, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there to say hi and meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens once a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only travel once a year to the DGC
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice will be burnt by the end of the
weekend, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I ain't got shit to do on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you at the DGC
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't make it to the DGC Cup,
that is okay.

another dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your piece and a hug up out the bag.
