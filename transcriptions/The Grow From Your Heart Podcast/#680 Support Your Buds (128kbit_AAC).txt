you may notice i've got some cotton mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: on the microphone i apologize if that's
coming through the recording i feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: my lips are clicking and sticking i took
some dabs of some concentrates i have some
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine live rosin that a denver
grower grew they don't want to be talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about on the show they kind of want to
remain anonymous but i've got a friend i
[SPEAKER_00]: gave some tester seeds of the machine to
uh them it's a couple uh they got some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in denver and they grew them and i
recently went to denver to hang out and
[SPEAKER_00]: they dabbed me out with some and i was
like i need some of that and like don't
[SPEAKER_00]: worry here's a jar they sent me home with
a little jar of the machine i took a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: of it uh i've got this extreme cotton
mouth the first thing i noticed i blew it
[SPEAKER_00]: out i was like i'm dehydrated it was just
like desert weed or something as soon as i
[SPEAKER_00]: blew it out my whole face my mouth anyway
my point is i apologize for the uh the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehydrated sounds in the microphone here
if you were hearing that i apologize also
[SPEAKER_00]: uh i apologize if i appear and uh appear
that's the only word for it if i appear uh
[SPEAKER_00]: disheveled or stunned that dab made me
feel like i don't know if i felt like i
[SPEAKER_00]: got the men in black fucking thing the
little zapper right to my eyes and i
[SPEAKER_00]: forgot life i forgot where i was i forgot
what i had to do i was like sitting there
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing before the show reading stuff and
we'll talk about what i was reading here
[SPEAKER_00]: in just a second when i get done rambling
but i took that dab in life just
[SPEAKER_00]: everything just shut down i was like i
don't know what the fuck i'm doing where
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm supposed to be uh i feel a little uh
disheveled here in front of all the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: with the camera it was a lot to come to
after taking that dab so a big shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to my friend who does not want to be named
they do not want to be named they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: lovely couple in denver that's all the
information you need that's probably too
[SPEAKER_00]: much already but you guys did a wonderful
job on the machine live rosin they grew
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants they harvested them they fresh
froze the plants then they turned those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into uh bubble hash basically then
they took the bubble hash and pressed that
[SPEAKER_00]: into rosin so nice process happened there
uh the plants looked beautiful the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates tasted amazing i'm lit up
from it obviously i'm still fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling about it anyway god made your
cotton mouth i apologize if it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: through on the microphone and i apologize
if i seem stunned and confused because i
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking am shout out to those dabs all
right i did mention i was reading some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff i did read an article where some
police discovered 77 pounds of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and they tried to claim that it was worth
2.5 million dollars i sat there for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of minutes with my calculator
trying to figure out where all my profits
[SPEAKER_00]: are going if cannabis is worth 2.5 million
dollars for 77 pounds uh we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: getting ripped off in colorado i tried to
do the math on that that has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere around 50 dollars a gram if they
are thinking that that weed was worth 2
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars hey popo the weed's not
worth 50 dollars a gram no matter what
[SPEAKER_00]: level you break it down to they try to say
that street level like yeah the street
[SPEAKER_00]: level is not going to sell a pound they're
going to sell grams grams are not 50 bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: officer if you're paying well yeah officer
the grams are 50 bucks you and kyle keep
[SPEAKER_00]: paying that anyway i just thought it was
funny the cops tried to say 77 pounds was
[SPEAKER_00]: worth 2 million dollars i did the math
real quick and i was like i've been
[SPEAKER_00]: getting ripped off where is all of my
money the commercial industry in colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: would thrive if weed was worth 2 million
dollars for 77 pounds that would change a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of things all right you guys i told
you i'm stoned and rambling i just wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to share you uh with you that silly thing
that i read on the internet there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what i was reading while i was dabbing
welcome into rasta jeff's world that was
[SPEAKER_00]: what was going on uh just a few minutes
ago before we got in front of these bright
[SPEAKER_00]: ass lights and tried to do a show i do
have some messages here in front of me
[SPEAKER_00]: that i want to jump into if not i'm just
going to continue to ramble aimlessly so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get to this message does this person
want their name said on the show first you
[SPEAKER_00]: can shout me out call me old ball coach
it's an awkward name but what up old ball
[SPEAKER_00]: coach thank you for joining the show it
says i'm a second time grower with a 25
[SPEAKER_00]: year layoff uh it sounds like you took a
little bit of a break there it says i love
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast and the youtube let's get
straight to the point i like that because
[SPEAKER_00]: i need something to get me to some sort of
a point today it goes on it says does one
[SPEAKER_00]: of your strains show a better resistance
to mildew mold and bud rot i realize
[SPEAKER_00]: weather conditions can and will affect my
plant but if you had one that was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more resilient which plant would it be
then they briefly explain their indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: project then they remind us that this will
be a project for 2022 then they wrap it up
[SPEAKER_00]: with love you here in virginia and we will
definitely hug our mom for you by the way
[SPEAKER_00]: i prefer that 80s old school funk find it
grow it let the people feel it all right
[SPEAKER_00]: that is perfect i'm glad that you added
that you like that old school funk because
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain recommendation i've got for you
is an old school funky aroma but before i
[SPEAKER_00]: get to making strain recommendations let
me give another big shout out to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends in virginia i've been getting
a lot of messages and friend requests from
[SPEAKER_00]: people in virginia and uh welcome to the
crew it's been great to meet so many new
[SPEAKER_00]: people where'd you guys all come from i
had no idea there were that many cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts in virginia you guys must have
been keeping a real quiet welcome to the
[SPEAKER_00]: club i'm glad to have you on the team glad
to be a part of your team let's work
[SPEAKER_00]: together but big shout out to virginia uh
let me talk about this strain
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation something i am noticing it
is fall time it's harvest time as i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: recording this uh many people are in the
process of harvesting a lot of commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grows have begun the outdoor
harvest uh if you've been watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: show you know that i've got a i had a
greenhouse running most of those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have come down i've still got a couple out
there they're not quite done i will let
[SPEAKER_00]: them go until it's a little bit colder
then they're gonna have to come down but i
[SPEAKER_00]: do have a greenhouse project that is
coming down at this time i was fortunate
[SPEAKER_00]: none of my plants got any major powdery
mildew boy tritis bud rot issues we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: touch of powdery mildew appearing right
before harvest time but no bud rot no bud
[SPEAKER_00]: mold no major issues i was fortunate not
to lose any of my plants but i have had
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and have seen a lot of stories on
social media and have heard a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stories about people losing their crop to
bud rot and mold problems because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy conditions we experienced this year
it was super hot for a long time and then
[SPEAKER_00]: one night they went guess what i'm not
gonna be hot anymore it's gonna be stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: cold and then we got a really cold night
and then it was like oh that was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: joke back to the hot days and then it was
like oh how about rain for three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: days and then we're gonna go back to
really hot again it's been really weird
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few a couple of fucking months here
in colorado the weather has just been
[SPEAKER_00]: jumping around it was hot hot hot and then
i guess nature had enough of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to just test out a few other things
and she threw it all at us and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get cold already i've had a
hoodie on a couple of nights a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: evenings here so the weather is changing
rapidly my point is a lot of people did
[SPEAKER_00]: get bud mold bud rot they had to throw
away portions of their crop don't try to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke that stuff don't sell that bud rot
bud moldy stuff to people i've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about that before have some ethics grow
from your heart grow with love take good
[SPEAKER_00]: care of the people that are going to smoke
your product uh just that way you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable girl you're not a piece of shit
person but um the easiest way to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: this is to have genetics that are more
resilient and resistant to these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems especially if you know if you
live in a climate where you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get bud rot bud mold stuff like that if
you grew this year and you had problems
[SPEAKER_00]: you can expect those problems again next
year the problems aren't going to go away
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions will probably be the same
unless you did something drastic to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct that environment so let's talk
about at least one or two of my strains i
[SPEAKER_00]: can recommend i like to have a couple more
than just one because when i do make this
[SPEAKER_00]: one recommendation there's a good
likelihood it will sell out quite quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: so i've got a backup plan for you just in
case i do recommend the morning dew strain
[SPEAKER_00]: for an environment that is very
susceptible to mold and mildew if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get those types of
problems the morning dew is a great strain
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in that environment it finishes in
a decent amount of time it should be done
[SPEAKER_00]: by the ninth week you might want to let it
finish that ninth week if your environment
[SPEAKER_00]: allows but outside it does finish a little
bit earlier so by the end of eight maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: nine weeks into flower that plant should
be done it'll start turning beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: colors it stinks really well and that is
one of my if not the most resistant plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to powdery mildew to bud mold and also to
other bugs i don't see a lot of bugs on
[SPEAKER_00]: that one if we get bugs in the room that's
the last plant that ever shows up me bug
[SPEAKER_00]: problems so the morning dew has been the
plant that i've been recommending to uh
[SPEAKER_00]: like the people in maine and portland and
places like that where they're getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of humidity and powdery mildew issues
i recommend the morning dew another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: i'll really recommend for you guys in the
same environment is the sun kiss sun kiss
[SPEAKER_00]: is great uh it's very mold resistant and
it finishes kind of early and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: potent and it has those delicious orange
candy orange creamsicle turps now another
[SPEAKER_00]: thing this uh viewer this listener did
mention they love that old school 80s funk
[SPEAKER_00]: uh that's really gonna help out with the
morning dew because that smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky funky old school weed i'm from
california i'm not trying to brag i'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't even matter but i remember
what old california weed smelled like is
[SPEAKER_00]: where i'm headed and the morning dew's got
some of that old california weed smell to
[SPEAKER_00]: it i hear a lot of the older guys complain
that we've kind of washed out some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those good smells and good aromas with all
this cake and candy bullshit that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: made now in the strains sometimes i do a
degree i miss that old california just
[SPEAKER_00]: that skunk weed that my family used to get
in california that shit used to smell so
[SPEAKER_00]: good and it's hard to find now i've got
some stuff that uh fills that void that
[SPEAKER_00]: fits that that genre but it's not the same
as it used to be and we're all chasing it
[SPEAKER_00]: now it looks like skunk is going to be the
popular turp coming back things come and
[SPEAKER_00]: go in phases for a while there it was
diesel and chem dog and then as weed got
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and popular uh the strain that
happened to be super popular in that realm
[SPEAKER_00]: in that time frame was of course the girl
scout cookies that strain was fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: super popular uh right along that same
time frame we got the gorilla glue number
[SPEAKER_00]: four uh then after that all of the uh the
cookie crosses that were real candy
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored like the gelatos the biscottis
all that sort of stuff started popping up
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of that is from the cookie code they
made a lot of that stuff popular but then
[SPEAKER_00]: we started seeing a lot of garlicky shit i
love the garlicky shit but i think the
[SPEAKER_00]: next thing that's coming or coming back is
we're gonna go back to that skunky shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what people want again uh maybe
it's because the people my age are uh were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to afford it and it's legal and now
that the people we were smoking when we
[SPEAKER_00]: were teenagers when it was popular now
that and everybody was smoking back then
[SPEAKER_00]: when it was popular now it's legal we want
that shit we smoked back in the day so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting popular again it's just like
music uh just like clothing that shit just
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to kind of the popular shit just
cycles back around comes back around um
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so pretty soon what i'm getting at is
i think that skunk will be the popular
[SPEAKER_00]: turp again that's going to be the thing
everybody's looking for uh so to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: long story short which it may be way too
fucking late for that the strain i would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend for your outdoor environment
where you're going to face mold and mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: problems the number one recommendation for
that would be the morning dew so check out
[SPEAKER_00]: some morning dew if that is not available
and if you're not into that skunky smell
[SPEAKER_00]: your next option would be the sun kiss all
right i want to thank my friend ol ball
[SPEAKER_00]: coach uh that's i can make so many bad bad
jokes about that but i'm gonna try to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay on track today uh obviously i
could go on a good ramble on that one
[SPEAKER_00]: let's keep me a little bit focused uh
thank you for the great message if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: have any more questions follow up i'd love
to hear back from you all right i've got
[SPEAKER_00]: another message here in front of me this
one i don't think they wanted their name
[SPEAKER_00]: said because i did not copy the name down
i cut and pasted this and printed it out
[SPEAKER_00]: and your name did not come along with this
so i apologize if you wanted a shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show it says what's up rasta jeff i
have some seeds from from a very
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known breeder words are hard today
you guys i apologize that dab is got me
[SPEAKER_00]: wrecked still i enjoy it i like it i hope
you can keep up with me it goes on it says
[SPEAKER_00]: i have some seeds from a very well-known
breeder and they are light in color i've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown your seeds and these don't come
close to the same color um yeah some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: will come out very dark some seeds come
out kind of a light gray silvery color
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not uncommon but some seeds that
are not all the way done will also be
[SPEAKER_00]: light in color so i would have to see a
picture of the seeds to have a real
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion of these seeds but it says my
question is what are the chances of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a viable plant if they even
germinate thanks for all you do man i am
[SPEAKER_00]: much more a much more confident grower due
to your podcast so much great info well
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great compliment hearing that you
are a more confident grower because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show that means a lot to me building
confidence is a good thing but let me
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to the point here um the only way to
find out if those seeds are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate is to attempt to germinate them
and the question is if they germinate will
[SPEAKER_00]: they even give you a viable plant yes if
they do germinate and a stem comes out or
[SPEAKER_00]: a tail comes out a root comes out and you
start building a plant out of that yes
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a viable plant that will be a good
plant um the customers the clientele the
[SPEAKER_00]: people purchasing the seeds they do prefer
the big beefy seeds with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration all the tiger striping or fancy
designs on them so those are what most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the customers get in a retail environment
i grow a lot of those ugly seeds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys would complain about that i'd
probably get an email from somebody if i
[SPEAKER_00]: sent them to you i grow those a lot of the
time and they make amazing plants they're
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as the seeds you got with all the
other color they just don't look as good i
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in another pile they are b or c
graded seeds sometimes i give b and c
[SPEAKER_00]: grade seeds out to my friends just here
you go you want some seeds take them bro
[SPEAKER_00]: because i can't sell these to the
customers because they will email me and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me that i sold them shit seeds before
they even tried to grow them so the only
[SPEAKER_00]: way to find out if those are good is to
germinate them and if they pop for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: if a tail comes out those are good seeds
and sometimes they just don't make dark
[SPEAKER_00]: colors something else i've noticed if you
take a seed that has got a lot of stripes
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of colors on it and you lick
your fingers and get your fingers good and
[SPEAKER_00]: moist and roll that seed around in your
fingers sometimes that coloration of that
[SPEAKER_00]: pigment will come right off of that seed
so i don't know how important those
[SPEAKER_00]: stripes are they let me know when my seeds
are ready when i'm breeding when i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: making the seeds they let me select seeds
for you but it's not a 100 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: determination on the quality of the seed
the way to find out like i keep saying
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate that seed grow it see what it
does for you if you really want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific about it make a documentation
of maybe number your seeds one through ten
[SPEAKER_00]: and then germinate them and always keep
that number attached to that seed this was
[SPEAKER_00]: seed number one seed number two and then
when you plant them make notes of this was
[SPEAKER_00]: the really pale seed or this seed was
darker this seed was really soft make
[SPEAKER_00]: notes and then see how they grow did that
pale shitty looking seed turn out to be
[SPEAKER_00]: one of your best plants because you never
know maybe you just found the next famous
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that's going to help everybody with
a certain ailment maybe everybody with
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer smokes your strain and they feel
like they can fly wouldn't it be amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a strain that made everybody with
cancer feel better so that's the magic of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing from seed you get to find out that
i just grow crap or am i growing magic
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to make a difference on the
planet a difference for people a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference for the community a difference
for the whole reputation of cannabis maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a difference for science maybe they find
your strain and they go man that thing's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a cannabinoid or a terpene in there or
a combo of those things with esters and
[SPEAKER_00]: palates that we've never seen and when
people smoke it they actually fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: levitate maybe you found something amazing
in there or maybe you got a crap seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to throw away but that's part of
the gamble that's part of the fun that's
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the passion with seeds that's why
i love growing from seed you never know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to come out of there you have
an idea i hope you have an idea especially
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're running my seeds i think that
my seeds are quite predictable but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in that variation is what i love
those outliers that you discover those
[SPEAKER_00]: anomalies those mutants those freak shows
those weirdos that come out of the the
[SPEAKER_00]: pack that everything looked like this and
it had this certain shape this certain
[SPEAKER_00]: color this certain aroma and then there
was this one just this one and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that's always so amazing to find so
don't throw away those seeds grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: don't discredit them already maybe i
should say don't judge a book by its cover
[SPEAKER_00]: don't judge a seed by its shell but grow
it out take good note and then remember
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then decide your future moves
with that breeder based on your experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with those seeds but please don't judge
that breeder or his product or your future
[SPEAKER_00]: purchases from that breeder and future
interactions based on seeds you have not
[SPEAKER_00]: germinated yet because what if you grow
them and they are fire what if you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: shit about these seeds because they don't
look good you go on a forum and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like breeder 5000 sold me sorry breeder
5000 if you're real i just made up a name
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder 5000 sold me some seeds and
they're all pale colored and they look
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit and you don't grow them but what
if five other people grow them and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like dude breeder 5000 sold me the most
amazing seeds ever then you're the asshole
[SPEAKER_00]: so you got to grow them you got to figure
out if they're good or if they're not big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to breeder 5000 all right i
think that covers that one right there
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't look close to the same color
are there chances of getting a viable
[SPEAKER_00]: plant if they germinate if they germinate
you've got a viable plant in my eye once
[SPEAKER_00]: they pop and a little tail starts coming
out and it's growing that's a viable plant
[SPEAKER_00]: it's up to you to keep it alive and bring
it to fruition and finish it so yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the way to find out the bottom line
grow it see what it does all right thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the great message i do apologize
if you wanted a shout out i did not copy
[SPEAKER_00]: down your name i kind of feel bad for that
if you want a shout out send me a message
[SPEAKER_00]: and say hey you read my email on the show
and you did not give me a shout out and
[SPEAKER_00]: i'll make sure to give you a special shout
out one of these parts of the show like
[SPEAKER_00]: right here i was like big shout out to my
friend who i forgot your name yeah we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do that for you all right you guys that
dab is not wearing off it is still cooking
[SPEAKER_00]: i got the dab sweats going on i don't know
if you could see it i got the ad in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rambles highly recommended 10 out of 10
would do it again all right i've got
[SPEAKER_00]: another message here in front of me this
one comes from b balla what up b balla
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been corresponding a little bit on
the patreon good supporter i see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: your comments on the youtube by the way
people ask why i don't respond to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the youtube comments i try not to see the
youtube comments because that's where all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the garbage is i've noticed that my
discord is all positivity and love patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: is all positivity and love because of
course you pay a couple of bucks to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there youtube is where the negative
comments reside and so i i just dodge that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the best way to not see some
bullshit not get sucked in not get dragged
[SPEAKER_00]: down just avoid the shit and if i don't go
scrolling looking for trouble i don't find
[SPEAKER_00]: it because uh i could be in a totally good
mood and then scroll across some shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: ass youtube comment that some troll left
and it could change my attitude and i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to give anybody especially some
anonymous fucking troll behind a keyboard
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't need that power to change my
day so i kind of avoid the youtube
[SPEAKER_00]: comments if i'm super bored or i actually
get email notifications sometimes when i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't check those for very often youtube's
like hey you have a lot of comments you
[SPEAKER_00]: should read then i'll go give it a scan
but i try and i try to stay out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you're sending me messages and
questions and stuff on youtube that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: i haven't replied to them i do apologize
but i have seen b balla leaving comments
[SPEAKER_00]: on almost every episode big up in much
respect for that let me get myself back on
[SPEAKER_00]: track let me find some sort of a point to
this madness and we will read your
[SPEAKER_00]: question it's says hey rasta jeff how's it
going i'm doing good bro i'm stoned to
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and smoke some machine dabs and uh i
am the machine i guess it says i had a
[SPEAKER_00]: question for you i was wondering if you
could give me advice on supporting buds
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the end of flowering you should
always support your buds if they need your
[SPEAKER_00]: love support if they just need someone to
talk to if they're having problems at home
[SPEAKER_00]: problems at work problems with their
girlfriend always be there for your buds
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very important then it also says
i'm toward the end of flowering i'm about
[SPEAKER_00]: to set up an eight by eight tent and i'm
trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how i'm going to support these buds you
guys know i'm joking right you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: he's going to have some tall nuggets he's
in a tent so he doesn't have a lot of work
[SPEAKER_00]: space most of the time i would recommend a
trellis setting in a five by five tent
[SPEAKER_00]: they sell a perfect five by five net it
fits beautifully in the tent but i
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it is a pain in the ass to work
around that trellis part of me wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: say we're not there for comfort we're not
there for a party that is a grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: option optimize it for the plants put up
the trellis and adjust sometimes i'll set
[SPEAKER_00]: up a trellis in a five by five tent and
honestly get down on my hands and knees
[SPEAKER_00]: and do the part below the net do any work
that needs to be done down there uh
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliating lollipopping that's probably
done before the net went up but get down
[SPEAKER_00]: on my hands and knees do all that work
pull the leaves out of the pots anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that fell um anything that needs to be
done i'll just get on my hands and knees
[SPEAKER_00]: and do it it's work it's not i'm not in
there to watch cartoons and have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time and smoke bowls and take dabs that's
after work i'm in there doing work so uh
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't bother me to get on my hands
and knees and do some work edit that
[SPEAKER_00]: however you'd like make fun of me for that
one there's a lot of opportunity there but
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't bother me to get dirty get in
there crouch down get sweaty hurt my back
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt my neck hurt my knees get some work
done that's what work is to me then when
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm done with that i'll go take dabs and
not be crouched down and enjoy it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: only an hour at the most it's a five by
five tent you're not going to be on your
[SPEAKER_00]: knees for more than an hour or two in
there crouch down getting shit done then
[SPEAKER_00]: get a five gallon bucket or a drum stool
is what i use and do everything above the
[SPEAKER_00]: net while you're sitting down comfortably
that'll make up for it so that is my first
[SPEAKER_00]: my first uh answer is to just suck it up
do the net crouch down if you're six foot
[SPEAKER_00]: four from the edge of that tent if you're
on your knees you can reach the center and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can reach if you can walk around uh
just the two or three sides that unzip you
[SPEAKER_00]: can reach everything inside of that tent
i've got a five by five i'm six foot five
[SPEAKER_00]: got a six foot wingspan here we can reach
all the way into that tent so um the first
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah i hate to tell you but just suck it
up and crouch down and do it bro that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the easiest way to do it i use two maybe
three layers of trellis netting i'll use
[SPEAKER_00]: the first layer to spread them out then
the second layer to kind of guide them and
[SPEAKER_00]: give them uh spread just show the buds
which way to go direction is the word i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for then the third one is actually
to support the colas that's to hold all
[SPEAKER_00]: those big buds so i'll do three trellises
in there and you're right at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are stuck you can't move them
if you want to work with them you're
[SPEAKER_00]: crawling on your hands and knees to get in
there but it's work it's not i keep saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's work it's not we're not in there
to have a good time work hurts work sucks
[SPEAKER_00]: work is dirty uh work is work that's why
we have play when we're done that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: you get paid for it that's why there are
rewards that's why there's a difference so
[SPEAKER_00]: um i'm sure you understand that part but
part of me is just saying suck it up bro
[SPEAKER_00]: crawl down on your hands and knees and get
in there my next option is have you
[SPEAKER_00]: considered adding an auto watering system
if you've got that trellis in place uh put
[SPEAKER_00]: the auto watering system in there put the
trellis in place then you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: crawl around to water you don't have to do
as much work on your hands and knees if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the auto watering system i can
press a button it turns on a pump that
[SPEAKER_00]: pump tells the water to go the water goes
i watch the plants uh or put it on a timer
[SPEAKER_00]: and i know that it spits out this many
gallons per minute my plants are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that much water let it run i don't even
have to get on my hands and knees and get
[SPEAKER_00]: down there as long as all those watering
emitters worked everything went well uh
[SPEAKER_00]: that's less crawling around to do so that
is another option i would say set up the
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis nets and do an auto watering
system that's a little bit of work up
[SPEAKER_00]: front but that saves you so much work on
the back end uh small investment a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of hours that'll save you so much work in
the long run so much climbing around uh so
[SPEAKER_00]: much time on your hands and knees
[SPEAKER_00]: also if you have to go out of town for a
couple of days or maybe always ideal for
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting the buds you can stick a stick
in the soil or the medium the cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're working it'll stick up you
could put it at an angle and then just to
[SPEAKER_00]: fix your bud with either uh i like to use
the little fuzzy stick so like pipe
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaners they're really affordable they
sell a lot of different options a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things at the grow store just
like a rubber coated wire or just a wire
[SPEAKER_00]: or a bread tie a twisty tie anything you
can just to fix and attach those colas to
[SPEAKER_00]: that stick with would work so just kind of
move it the way you want it and just wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: it right up kind of low go lower than you
need to with the zip tie and don't go too
[SPEAKER_00]: tight don't choke the bud don't choke the
stem just just give it a little seatbelt
[SPEAKER_00]: just attach it to that stick um then you
can put as many sticks as you want in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and spread that plant out the way
that you need it and shape it the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: want it by using those sticks that's
really helpful one thing i'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention those sticks are fucking dangerous
uh make sure you protect your eyes maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: put something on the end of the sticks put
a little duct tape flag so you remember
[SPEAKER_00]: it's there put a little ball of duct tape
on it so that when you lean down to water
[SPEAKER_00]: your pots you don't get that stick in your
eye i've done it i've seen it happen
[SPEAKER_00]: luckily you'll be leaning down and you'll
see that stick just as it enters your eye
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll go shit a stick but your body is
already moving but you'll trigger up and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just touch your eyeball mine when i
did it just touched my eye and i jumped up
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh shit it touched my eye probably
should have gone to the doctor because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably some pesticides or some
bullshit on there but i'm a stubborn guy
[SPEAKER_00]: and i thought i gotta keep working i just
kept doing my shit but be very very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful of those sticks if you do use them
especially the green sticks because they
[SPEAKER_00]: blend in with your plants you don't even
fucking see them you forget they're there
[SPEAKER_00]: you get busy you'll poke yourself in the
eye that's why i prefer the trellis but
[SPEAKER_00]: the sticks keep the plants independent
they allow you to work a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: i get it so the sticks are always there
another great option is tomato cages you
[SPEAKER_00]: can buy a tomato cage at most of your big
or small hardware stores especially around
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow season if your local hardware
store or local nursery or garden supply
[SPEAKER_00]: store doesn't have them you can always
order them on amazon they'll show up at
[SPEAKER_00]: the front door tomato cages are very
useful they're just a circle a wire circle
[SPEAKER_00]: with three or four what is it horizontal
vertical posts to keep them together so
[SPEAKER_00]: your circles are horizontal you got three
or four vertical posts to stick those into
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt they taper they get bigger at the
top and skinnier at the bottom i've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: people do it both ways i've seen them
flipped over and have this skinnier ring
[SPEAKER_00]: up top and i've seen people with the
bigger ring up top i prefer the big ring
[SPEAKER_00]: up top because then i can spread the plant
out and i've got a big circle that i can
[SPEAKER_00]: use the bread ties or the zip ties i can
pull my plant out and attach it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside ring of that tomato cage and then
my top is going up right up the middle my
[SPEAKER_00]: outer buds are all spread out big nice
bushy plant i usually do a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot with a tomato cage top the plant twice
get it huge and bushy i like to fit about
[SPEAKER_00]: four of those under a thousand watt light
that's always a fun game so my three
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations would be to stick with
that trellis and just learn to work around
[SPEAKER_00]: it which i know isn't ideal and it sucks
having some dude tell you just suck it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and work around it and hurt your back
occasionally but that's what i would do
[SPEAKER_00]: that is what i do i'm six foot five i
definitely feel your struggle i hit my
[SPEAKER_00]: head on lights all the time i bonk my head
on shit i got these big dreadlocks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it's awkward working around things
maneuvering in but it's work that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting paid for um you got to put
some some blood sweat and tears into that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit but if that's not an option i totally
understand i'm not going to tell you to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there and break your back if you
don't want to that's when i would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend either sticks or tomato cages
both are cost-effective both keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants independence where the plants are
movable and then also uh you can get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and work with them because you don't
have to crawl around under that trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: although i do think you'll find great
results with the trellis once you get
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with it i've had my best
harvest weights uh best potency most uh
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive grows have always been things
that i've trellised out all right b bala i
[SPEAKER_00]: hope i gave you some useful advice i know
i started off by telling you just to suck
[SPEAKER_00]: it up and crawl in there and do some work
uh that's that's honestly my straight-up
[SPEAKER_00]: answer that's what i would tell anybody at
the grove somebody was like but boss i
[SPEAKER_00]: have to crawl down there like well you're
on the clock fucking crawl down there
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy what are we paying you for i would
do it too i wouldn't just tell somebody to
[SPEAKER_00]: do some shit that i wouldn't do that's how
i do it so i hope i answered your question
[SPEAKER_00]: i hope i gave you some useful advice here

[SPEAKER_00]: ask me more questions i do love follow-ups
