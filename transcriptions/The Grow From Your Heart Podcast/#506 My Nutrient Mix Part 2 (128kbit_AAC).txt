[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of lemon wreath live
batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of cam brulee and secret
kush mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
lemon rind and tea tree oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say there is also an extra
funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the flavor and buzz from
the lemon wreath live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It obviously has me talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me in a really good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be a wonderful
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
clone cutters and pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is time to jump into another mix
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the previous episode, I went into great
detail on my vegetative nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to discuss my flowering
nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this in the last episode,
but I want to repeat it before I start
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about my mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This nutrient mix works for me in my
environment with my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what strains you're running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what kind of lights you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much airflow is in your
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's happening in your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me on many different setups,
I run this nutrient mix in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and I run this nutrient mix in
my own personal environment, and it works
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what I teach you, no matter what
the bottles teach you, no matter what the
[SPEAKER_00]: meters in the room tell you, the plants
are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to them and adjust
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say Rasta Jeff said to feed it cow
mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot see your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants have a problem, let them
tell you what the problem is and adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't force the plants to do anything
because it will not work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that everything I am
teaching you works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to pay close attention to the
plants and make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be game time decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do encourage you to adjust and
custom tailor this recipe to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all stuff that I have tested and
experimented with, and this is what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: using in commercial grows throughout
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I have taught people in
commercial grows in Oklahoma to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what people in Missouri are
running in commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what people in Massachusetts and
New Mexico are running based on my
[SPEAKER_00]: consultations and my setups and my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got people all over the country
running this exact nutrient mix and the
[SPEAKER_00]: table type of setup I explained in the
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is nobody pays me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all stuff that I use because it
works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to adjust some things to work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your environment may be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lights may be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your watering style is probably different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your strains and your genetics are most
likely completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will need to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with all of that being said,
let's dive into my nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: My flowering plants are in three gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are filled with cocoa that is amended
with perlite and persilite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone over that in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to water until I get about 20%
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I water, I want approximately
20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of the flowering phase,
I am generally watering my plants every
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to water right when the lights come
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as the lights come on at eight
or nine o'clock or maybe seven o'clock in
[SPEAKER_00]: some places, we've got a nutrient mix
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights click on and those plants get
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to water them right when the lights
come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as they get bigger later in the
flowering cycle, they may need another
[SPEAKER_00]: watering before we leave for the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to water them one more time
around five or six o'clock so that when we
[SPEAKER_00]: come back the next morning, they're not
crispy and dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm generally watering these plants
once or twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get nutrients at every watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the previous episode, I talked about
different styles of mixing your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the Monday blast where you get
everything in the nutrient tank Monday and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants get fed everything on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the rest of the week, they get base
nutrients and maybe some Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can do the thing that I like to do,
where you feed them a base mix every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day and then you add a boost every
day on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my environment, like I said,
I'm watering every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to mix up a different mix on a
daily basis and feed my plants exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have access to your plants
in your reservoir and your rooms as often
[SPEAKER_00]: as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to either mix up on Monday
and put everything in there and feed it
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can feed it one big fat heavy
feed on Monday and then just supplement
[SPEAKER_00]: with just base nutrients through the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you're able to do the big base
nutrient mix with a boost every day like I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something you're going to have to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my example, I'm going to tell you what
I use for base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will tell you what I use for boost
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to you to decide how you want to
apply those boosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I mix a base mix every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I rotate boost products throughout
the week to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say Monday, I'll mix up my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say that my base is five grams of
veg bloom powder, one milliliter of liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: lightning start and five milliliters of
ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then throughout the week, I will rotate
through boosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say day one, we will use Plus
Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day two, I will use CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on day three, I will use lightning
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll just go back to the top of the
list and repeat that through the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: week as we feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I do my boosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may, like I said a moment ago,
need to mix up your reservoir and put that
[SPEAKER_00]: five grams of base nutrient in there,
the lightning start, the ruby,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you may be adding all of those
boosters all at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the plants accept your feeding
properly, you are not doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what works for your lifestyle,
your grow style, your gardening style,
[SPEAKER_00]: and most of all, do what works for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the flowering phase,
I do recommend that we adjust our pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: our nutrient solution to somewhere between
6.2 and 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an ideal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we are working in cocoa and we're
using a lot of nutrients and we've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of fulvic acid, that will be perfect
for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the entire process,
adjust your pH solution to 6.1 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the actual nutrients
I am using in my flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to go through this week by
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to do a nine week schedule
and of course the last 10 to 14 days of
[SPEAKER_00]: that schedule will be a flush with
probably no nutrients, maybe a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific products if you want to add
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get through the whole lesson,
I will talk about a few other options you
[SPEAKER_00]: can add if it suits your budget and if it
suits your experience level and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable adding a few more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I've been teasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been building a lot of
hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually discuss my flowering
nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the previous mix episode, I talked
about having two different base mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to do a very similar idea in
this episode and again, it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important that you do not double up on
your base mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that is I like to use veg
bloom powdered nutrients as my base in
[SPEAKER_00]: some facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other facilities, I am using all new
millennium bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm using the veg bloom powdered
nutrients, I will subtract the new
[SPEAKER_00]: millennium base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two different options for base
mixes and I will make them both very clear
[SPEAKER_00]: in each week's mix recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you have probably already made a
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if you're going to use the veg
bloom powdered nutrients, or you know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to use the new millennium
liquid bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you hear the appropriate
mix, you will know which recipe to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make it very clear for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: For week one, we've got two options for
base mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with that five grams of veg
bloom base mix per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got five grams of veg bloom per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you are going to use the new
millennium bottled nutrients, replace that
[SPEAKER_00]: five grams with four milliliters of
Equinox, six milliliters of summer shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: and six milliliters of autumn gold per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you use the veg bloom or the new
millennium, either way, you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: add one milliliter of lightning start and
five milliliters of ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to recap, the liquid formula is
four milliliters of Equinox, six
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of summer shift, and six
milliliters of autumn gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will add one milliliter of
lightning start and five milliliters of
[SPEAKER_00]: ruby per gallon to your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is if you are using the new
millennium mix, if you're using the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom base, it will be five grams of veg
bloom powder, one milliliter of lightning
[SPEAKER_00]: start, and five milliliters of ruby per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your two options for base mixes
for week one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are the boosts which I would
recommend adding through week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that you add a little
bit of Cal Mag at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which brand of Cal Mag you
have purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which bottle you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using the General Hydroponics
Cali Magic, I recommend one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per gallon of Cal Mag as a
boost in this recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also recommend one milliliter per
gallon of lightning start as a boost in
[SPEAKER_00]: this recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend one half to one full gram
of plus life per gallon of water as a
[SPEAKER_00]: boost in this recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will have your base mix that you
will feed every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you are going to rotate your
boosts, you will do Cal Mag at one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: mills per gallon, lightning start at one
milliliter per gallon, and then plus life
[SPEAKER_00]: at one half to one full gram per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the week one mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into week two of the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our base mix, we have got the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use five grams of veg bloom dried
nutrients, or you can use five milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: of Equinox, six milliliters of summer
shift, and six milliliters of autumn gold
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's five milliliters of Equinox,
six milliliters of summer shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: and six milliliters of autumn gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: To that, if you are using the veg bloom
dried mix or that veg bloom liquid mix I
[SPEAKER_00]: just spoke of, we are going to add one
milliliter per gallon of apatite from new
[SPEAKER_00]: millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also going to add five mills of
ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what we have done, we have
increased the Equinox by one milliliter to
[SPEAKER_00]: add a little more energy to the plants,
and we have swapped out the lightning
[SPEAKER_00]: start for the apatite because I think we
have got enough roots at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to focus more on the PK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is our base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using the five grams of veg
bloom mix or the new millennium liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: mix, make sure to add that one mill of
apatite and five milliliters of ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our boosts for week two are going to be
one to two mills of cow mag, one
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter of lightning start,
and one half to one full gram of plus life
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weeks one and two are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is that we have now
introduced the apatite PK to start
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing phosphorus and potassium to
give us fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three is when we are going to add a
product called Shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shine is part of the veg bloom lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that adding Shine early in flower
will help reduce stretch so that our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants don't get so stretchy for the first
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think it helps start speeding up
bud development, and I know it absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: helps start developing trichomes early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's add a little bit of Shine to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving onto the mix, we'll get more
specific on that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on the base mix for week
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can use the veg bloom
powdered nutrients at five grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon, or you can use the new millennium
base mix for week three that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be five milliliters of equinox,
five milliliters of summer shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've increased to 10 milliliters of
autumn gold per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is our main base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either use the five grams of dried
nutrients or five milliliters of equinox,
[SPEAKER_00]: five milliliters of summer shift,
and 10 milliliters of autumn gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, please do not mix the five
grams and that solution together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will fry the shit out of your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whichever base mix you have chosen to
work with, to that we are going to add the
[SPEAKER_00]: one milliliter per gallon of apatite,
and we are also going to add five
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per gallon of ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, every time we mix up a nutrient
solution in this facility, we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: add five milliliters per gallon of water
of ruby every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our five milliliters of equinox,
five milliliters of summer shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milliliters of autumn gold,
or five grams of veg bloom powdered
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: To that, we have mixed in our one
milliliter of apatite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added five mills of ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our boosts for week three are going
to be CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we will do CalMag at one to
two milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which brand you have
purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys pay attention to what the bottle
says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the back of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe use half of the recommended dosage
and pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see a CalMag deficiency coming
on, don't try to boost it up really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase it slowly and the plants will
appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our boosts are CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to use one milliliter of
lightning start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to use one half to one
gram of plus life per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this week we are going to add Shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add one gram of Shine per gallon of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our boosts for week three are CalMag,
lightning start, plus life, and Shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now by the end of week three, we should
start seeing nice buds sets, little bud
[SPEAKER_00]: developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little dandelions are popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is starting to get exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to increase the apatite and
increase the Shine to start building up
[SPEAKER_00]: those big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on the week four base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: For week four, you do have the option of
five grams per gallon of veg bloom base
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you are using new millennium liquid
nutrients, you can use five milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon of water of Equinox,
five milliliters per gallon of summer
[SPEAKER_00]: shift, and 10 milliliters per gallon of
autumn gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for week four, our base is either five
grams of dried nutrients or five mills of
[SPEAKER_00]: Equinox, five mills of summer shift,
and 10 mills of autumn gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: To either one of those mixes, we are going
to add two milliliters of apatite and five
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that every time we mix up a
nutrient solution, we are going to add
[SPEAKER_00]: five mills of ruby to make it worth our
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ruby works like an octane booster or
a turbocharger for our nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be sure to add that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for our boosts for week four,
we are going to add one to two milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: of CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also going to use one half to one
full gram of plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this week we are going to increase to
two grams of shine per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are working our way into week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are starting to see nice bud
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to take the summer shift
out of the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't using summer shift anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mixes are going to change a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the week five flowering
feed mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: On week five, of course you can use five
grams of dried veg bloom powdered
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients as your base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can use four milliliters of equinox
and 16 milliliters of autumn gold per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon as your base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your options are five grams of veg
bloom dried powdered nutrients or four
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of equinox and 16 milliliters
of autumn gold per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do not double up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep repeating this, but do not
use both base mixes because you will cook
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you two options because some
people want to use veg bloom and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to use new millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that they work beautifully when you
combine the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to use the powdered base
nutrients and then add in the boosters and
[SPEAKER_00]: the add-ins from new millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's refocus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our options are five grams of dried
nutrients or four mills of equinox and 16
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of autumn gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mix the dried and the wet nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, to that, whichever base
you have chosen, we are going to add two
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of appetite and five
milliliters of ruby per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our base setup for week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our boost for week five will be one to two
milliliters of cow mag, one half to one
[SPEAKER_00]: gram of plus life and two grams of shine
per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move into week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week six is going to be very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the five grams of veg bloom,
dried base nutrients or four milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: of equinox and 16 milliliters of autumn
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week we're going to increase the
appetite because our buds are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a little more PK, a little more
energy, a little more beef, a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now got three milliliters of
appetite per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, we are going to add the
five milliliters of ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our boosts for week six are going to
be one to two milliliters of cow mag,
[SPEAKER_00]: one half to one full gram of plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're adding in two full grams
of shine per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are going to have nutrient
deficiencies, if you're going to run into
[SPEAKER_00]: a nitrogen deficiency, if you're going to
have a cow mag deficiency, now is really
[SPEAKER_00]: when it is going to start standing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for nutrient deficiencies at
this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to adjust things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's happening in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot see your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now is the time when you really need
to pay close attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting to the home stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are at high performance mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when it is very likely that you
will notice the early onset of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your pH is properly dialed in
before you water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you are taking the runoff
reports I've spoken of in previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting really close to harvest
time, but we are also getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: critical time where the plants will begin
to show and express problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be on the lookout every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in the grow as often as you can,
looking at leaves up top, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your grow because now we
are putting these plants in high
[SPEAKER_00]: performance mode and the heat is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are halfway through the grow and we can
either make it amazing or we can ruin it
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared and stay on top of your
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get lazy because you've gotten this
far in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's keep me focused and work our way
into week seven of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week seven, you can use the five grams
of veg bloom powdered base nutrient mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can use four milliliters of Equinox
and 16 milliliters of Autumn Gold per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't mix the five grams with the
four and the 16 do one or the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I can quit saying that by the time
we get to week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, on top of that base mix,
we are going to add four milliliters per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon of Appetite and five milliliters
per gallon of Ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our boost for week seven are going to be
one to two milliliters of cow mag,
[SPEAKER_00]: one half to one full gram of Plus Life and
two grams of Shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you are an experienced grower and
you know what to watch for and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: adding anything else, you may be able to
increase the amount of Shine you add at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would increase slowly, maybe a half a
gram at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go more than one gram, but you may
be able to get two and a half to three
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of Shine into the plants at this
time without causing any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That depends on how much light you've got,
what kind of plants you're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what strains you've got, how they take
nutrients and the rest of the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room will also be a factor,
but you may be able to increase the Shine
[SPEAKER_00]: at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to move into week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my grow schedule, I plan on growing
these plants for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm able to go for nine and a
half weeks, but most of the time I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to a 63 day flowering schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I press it too far one way or the
other, I throw the other rooms off,
[SPEAKER_00]: which throws the entire facility off,
which throws production off and that
[SPEAKER_00]: ripples throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get back on schedule for several
months when I do bullshit moves like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try very carefully to keep my rooms
on a 63 day flowering schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means at week eight, we need to
consider flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get at least 10 days maybe 14
days of flushing out of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this scenario, we are going to feed
these plants for the first four days of
[SPEAKER_00]: week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are going to transition to a flush
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are growing in cocoa, so nutrients are
not hanging around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also watering the plants twice a
day, which means this cocoa is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rinsed out approximately 20 times
before we go to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to have plenty of flush time
and plenty of flush activity on these
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallon pots for 10 days before we
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get there, let's focus on the
four days of week eight, which we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to feed these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need to add nitrogen for the
last four days of our feeding regimen
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are going to work on pushing
that out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we want to focus on fat,
chunky bud development and trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to ditch most of the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to focus on five milliliters
of ruby per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also going to use 10 milliliters of
winter frost per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter frost is from new millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to bust out that winter frost
and add that to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our boosts for week eight are going to be
one half to one gram of plus life and four
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per gallon of apatite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every day we are going to get the five
milliliters of ruby and 10 milliliters of
[SPEAKER_00]: winter frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are going to do a day of plus
life, a day of apatite, a day of plus life
[SPEAKER_00]: and a day of apatite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are going to begin flushing on the
fifth day of week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give us day five, six and seven
of week eight for flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get all of week nine for flush that
will give us a beautiful flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buds will taste delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will burn nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a wonderful product if we dry
and cure it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a whole nother episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, I don't recommend adding
any products during flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason to add anything at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to rinse out that cocoa to
where there are no nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the plants starve themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they begin to cannibalize themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat up all the leftover sugars and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way our buds taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our bulls burn smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's work on a flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we have to do is water the plants as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water them in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water them again before you leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the end of week nine when you
harvest, those plants should taste
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious and they should burn beautifully
without weird ashes and weird aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that does depend on a proper dry
and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you did experience any nutrient
burn, any problems, during the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, when you are flushing, you can use
a product called SLF100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help clean your cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help clean out the rhizosphere
during the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will help give you a cleaner
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will help speed up the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally don't recommend a flushing
agent or a flush product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be unnecessary in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do something like that,
I would use SLF100.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most situations, there is no need
to add anything during the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just run plenty of water through those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drown them at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flush them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to rinse out the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last few days of flush,
I don't even adjust the pH because I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about the pH of the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't need the plants able to
absorb nutrients anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjusting the pH is all about making
nutrients available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last couple of days, I'm basically
just watering the plants to keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: alive until I choose to give them the
chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is the basic recipe for my
new millennium and veg bloom nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that there were some things
I would add and things that more
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced growers can add if your budget
allows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your skill level makes you comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a few more things you can
add to this mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like a product called Decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use Decision at day one of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add it to your nutrient mix at a rate of
15 milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see that your plants begin to
flower sooner than they would have if you
[SPEAKER_00]: did not use Decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend Decision on day one of the
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also recommend a product called
Carbonaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically carbs to give the plants
energy I like to add Carbonaria at a rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of five milliliters per gallon in mid to
late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start this probably around week
four or week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with the Carbonaria because it
is sticky and goopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using some sort of an
auto-watering system, you will need to use
[SPEAKER_00]: your filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, stir it up very well and put the
carb in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stir the shit out of it, then add the
Shine and Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add them together without stirring,
you're going to make a big ball of
[SPEAKER_00]: funkiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do use the Carbonaria,
make sure you stir the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recommend using a filter if you're
using an auto-watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You folks that build the irrigation
systems, you know what I mean by adding a
[SPEAKER_00]: filter or a pre-filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also will recommend a product called
Budswell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budswell is a bloom booster that is mainly
guano based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend Budswell at a rate of two
milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me back up before we get carried
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Carbonaria and Budswell would be used
as a booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just add those down the daily sheet like
your Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Wednesday you're going to add
Carbonaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Thursday you're going to add
Budswell now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just add one more booster to the list and
keep that in the rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The decision you will only use once and
that is the first day of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're mixing up your nutrients for the
full week, you will be okay feeding that
[SPEAKER_00]: through the entire first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will just trigger your plants to go
into flower that much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to the Budswell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said two milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would start that at mid to late
flower, sometime around week five or week
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it fits the budget, add it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to save a few bucks,
wait until week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I like is Solicium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solicium is silicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend two to four milliliters per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recommend you can use Solicium from
the time you go to large veg all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the time you begin to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Solicium adds a little bit of
strength to the plants and they recover a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more when we do pop and crack and
twist them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Solicium at two to four milliliters per
gallon from large veg all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product is a little pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I say it's an add-on if it is
something you want to add, if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that fits the budget,
and if you feel it's necessary for your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product that I will recommend is
SLF100 at five milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: SLF100 is enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend using that toward the
end of flower and during the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it fits your budget, maybe consider
using SLF100 once per week, once you go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you guys, these last few items
are not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just things for when you feel
comfortable with the original mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to step up your game a little
bit more, if you feel like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify a problem and correct and adjust
to problems on the fly, then you can step
[SPEAKER_00]: up your game a little bit and add a few of
these products when your skill level and
[SPEAKER_00]: your budget are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can add these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recommend you add them maybe one at
a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe have a harvest and buy another
bottle, and then have another harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: buy another bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy everything all at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly increase your game, step up your
skill level, step up the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: products you're using, and I think your
garden will appreciate you taking your
[SPEAKER_00]: time and building up slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got one or two more things I'm
going to recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I really like is Liquid
Karma from Botanic Air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a lot of Liquid Karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when I use Liquid Karma in mid to
late flower, it adds a little bit of funky
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma to my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my cushy stuff a little bit
cushier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my sweet stuff a little bit
sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that that comes from the
kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend Liquid Karma or a
similar kelp based product for mid to late
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go with Liquid Karma, I will
recommend three to five milliliters of
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid Karma per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that would be added as a boost in
the rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the last thing I'm going to recommend
is a product from the Veg Bloom lineup
[SPEAKER_00]: called Push.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to apply Push as a foliar feed once
per week by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also add Push to my integrated pest
management program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I apply a sprayed on pesticide,
I add the recommended dosage of Push to
[SPEAKER_00]: that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the budget allows it, I highly
recommend a once a week foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend a foliar feeding of a
product called Push.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to apply Push from the time I go
into those four or six inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will apply Push all the way up until
week four or five of flower, just
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how big and chunky the buds
have gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the buds are spongy and they're able
to kind of suck up some of that moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not apply a foliar feed,
but I will spray right up until they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit chunky with that Push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be very careful and don't spray big
buds and don't let that moisture hang
[SPEAKER_00]: around for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that air get stagnant in your
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you opportunities for
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, clone cutters and pollen
chuckers, I think that wraps up my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mix episode.
