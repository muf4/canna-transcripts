[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 382 of the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy new year, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy new year, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming and hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back due to popular demand, the people
have spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want more white Mike on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have more of thou white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, this podcast is brought to you
by our good friends at the Hella Dank seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to add some fresh genetics to
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of that old stale shit,
grow some new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that at the Hella Dank seed
company at www.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's tradition that we start the
show by talking about what we're dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is still coughing from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to keep hesitating between
sentences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tar scraper on the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got a little, a little tickle
in the lung there from that last dab we
[SPEAKER_00]: took.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to brag, not to talk about how good
our dabs are, but we took a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Apothecary Farms internally flawless
series diamond, broke a few little pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: off of that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heated up the banger, dropped a diamond
into there, and then dropped a fat glob of
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey full terpene, hive terpene,
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, I forgot the words now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically lemon Jeffrey terps right on top
of that dab, then capped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike took a little tiny micro dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a pretty big fat dab of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both sat here and coughed and changed
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a fun game with Mike,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As he blew out the dab, I said,
real quick, name this new cross I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tried to spit out straight names
and it was funny to watch him scramble,
[SPEAKER_00]: making words was hard enough, then trying
to put them together to make a strain name
[SPEAKER_00]: was pretty funny to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So words were hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good words were not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were smoking on, it was the
internally flawless diamonds with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey terps on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, we may have had a few other
random dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have hit the star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably hit the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, wait, the GG four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't say gorilla glue anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goat power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a tab of something called goat
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells straight up like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else that could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we've had plenty of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mike is well lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a dab break here in the
middle of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right over there, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your eyes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a slight technical glitch at the
beginning and Jeff pointed out something
[SPEAKER_01]: on the screen and now I'm having trouble
not watching the audio feed record itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still, it's still doing the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident that that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lava lamp like appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to stare at it and watch
that thing move up and down really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to see to watch my words make lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the computer in a different spot so
that I wouldn't do what Mike is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch myself staring at the little graph
that, you know, when you talk into audio
[SPEAKER_00]: software that makes a little graph,
it shows how high it looks like a lie
[SPEAKER_00]: detector test on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it that way,
it's like, it looks like the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing that with my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's jumping up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit here and stare into it while I talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I use the headphones so I
can stare into the screen and I can hear
[SPEAKER_00]: you clearly and not have to look and look
around the table to hear people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stay with my voice onto the mic and
I can look into the thing, but now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: mesmerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to move it in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to focus on your notepad and
notes right now and it's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cause it's upside down to you and
you've got terrible eyesight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't picked up on it yet,
we're glazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might've smoked a lot of dabs before
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy new year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second episode of the new
year, I do believe if we're doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first episode with Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy new year, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019 is going to be the more white Mike is
my resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: More white Mike on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just more white Mike is a cool new year's
resolution for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just more white Mike, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, there is going to be
content in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just going to sit here and get
rambly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did write down some notes on a
piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wanted to have fun at the start of
the show, settle in, get a vibe going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, who needs business right at the top of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Mike, do you want to jump into this
farm bill stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready for all of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We most certainly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I'm going to read this farm bill
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike goes, bro, it's like a hundred
and something pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, maybe I'll let you
just tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's not just like a hundred
pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the first hundred pages of
Harry Potter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hundred pages of some of the most
dull language you could ever come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawyers are evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally lawyer means fucked up
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one else understands that we argue
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm married to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for those of you who took a look
at it, it didn't feel like reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do kind of a light gloss
over of what the farm bill is,
[SPEAKER_01]: what all is jammed into it, why this
year's was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hint it has to do with hemp
legalization and what that means for,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, hemp markets, CBD, all that good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad this is a Thursday episode and
not a Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday, like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm spoiling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said I was not going to put out
a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, I feel a little extra
off leash because for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, you straight up told people on
Monday, you weren't going to do a Thursday
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I respected that as a listener because
it's fucking new years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go have some fun buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we had a chance to get together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not do a Thursday show?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's reason one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reason two, I'm just in a really good mood
and we've been having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do a good fun show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed up in a good mood and then I
got you extra high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well we got extra high together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to blame it on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like you tricked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try some of this one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some of this blue candy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at taking another one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, if you want another dab,
you dig in that pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pile is inviting too, but it's the
same shit that's in that pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we discussed last week, my brain wants
to go outside for a different chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well avoid those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip that and not dab and not
get bakter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fun to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baked a higher stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoned her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, people are just fucking tuning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just fucking gone on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we dive right into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will, we are going to miss if we dive
too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just wait and then gently walk
into the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kick your flip flops off and slowly
wade into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is getting weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm bill is a major piece of federal
legislation that we do every four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is, might be every five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it's every four years and
it covers a huge range of topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from how and where different
agricultural crops get grown to food
[SPEAKER_01]: safety testing that's required to food
stamps and nutrition programs in schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a massive bill that covers
all sorts of different things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: very loosely related to agriculture and
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it gets very scientific and
you wouldn't think about it when you think
[SPEAKER_01]: like farming or the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with like lab testing
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And FDA rules and regulations also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has things like crop insurance for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a tornado shows up and fucks up
their soybean harvest, they're not just
[SPEAKER_01]: broke and destitute now that there's a
form of federal insurance that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: apply for and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the farm bill is massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's huge and politics is kind
of weird and quirky, a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things get attached to it every time they
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And politicians use it as a way to get
leverage on other people sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're not willing to jeopardize
something you care about in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they slip in a pet project of
theirs, you're not going to torpedo their
[SPEAKER_01]: pet project because it's part of this
thing you care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those little attachments this
year was legalizing hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Republican senator from Kentucky
attached it to this year's farm bill and
[SPEAKER_01]: it passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It passed without any fanfare outside of
our small community, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp has been illegal to grow in the
US for like 60 or 70 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was banned after World War II.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was rebanned after World War II.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was banned before World War II also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was rebanned basically under the
theory that you could hide marijuana in
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp fields, which if you know anything
about the cannabis plant isn't really a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both kind of ruin each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're growing the hemp for a
reason and you grow marijuana in it and it
[SPEAKER_01]: cross-pollinates, you're going to fuck up
your hemp harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your hemp harvest cross-pollinates
with your cannabis harvest, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to ruin your cannabis harvest also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not immediately, but especially 40,
50, 60 years ago when they were having
[SPEAKER_01]: this argument, it was exceptionally
illogical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensimilia wasn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop separation, like we know now,
isn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been a major issue,
but they managed to attach it to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition in general and fighting
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hemp's been illegal to grow across the
US for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time somebody brings up how
moronic this is and how many different
[SPEAKER_01]: products that hemp could be and currently
is being used in across the US,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we can't grow it, usually the DEA
brings up their original objections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used to hide marijuana or high
THC crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be confusing for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been another one that I've always
loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were real vocal in the nineties and
early thousands about how we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize hemp because cops could never be
trained to tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were open and honest about how
they were sure that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at the two plants side
by side, if I took you to a hemp farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, bro, show me the cannabis and
show me the hemp, you couldn't tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we went out to the big hemp farm
out here on the highway on 96,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a giant one on the right side of
the road there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it when you drive out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those look like cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get close and rub them,
they've got trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smell your fingers, it smells like
that Tora Bora that we used to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that Afghani cherry smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing a real Afghan cherry
scented cultivar out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing for CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a specific type of hemp that they're
using that grows similar to the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the hemp for textiles,
there's like 11 feet tall and looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: more like sugar cane or reeds in the river
than it does like a bushy Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very skinny, single stock that goes way
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get a little kind of looks
like a bud at the very top, but the field
[SPEAKER_01]: looks very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull up hemp for victory and look
at the two plants and they look fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: dissimilar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main issue with hemp being an
illegal is hundreds and hundreds of US
[SPEAKER_01]: companies have to import it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been this weird rule where you
can't grow it, but you can buy all of it
[SPEAKER_01]: that you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if these objections are true for the
growing plant, they're similarly true or
[SPEAKER_01]: equally true for the harvested plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can import all we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been able to buy, I mean,
hemp is the brand that I always think of
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's the one my mom's used for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of her friends turned her on to the
lotion back in like 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it candle shop hemp lotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hemp seed oil is one of the
ingredients in the lotion product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they have to import all of that from
another country to use in their products
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what this year's farm bill did is
it finally opened up the market to US
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we can produce our own hemp,
which is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that nobody spoke up with any
of the dumbass objections of the past is I
[SPEAKER_01]: think another big symbol that legalization
moving forward through education is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we don't have to import a large
import product from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's where most of it was
coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all over the planet, China grows
hemp, Canada grows hemp, Japan grows hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan's using hemp right now to clean up
Fukushima.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an incredibly versatile plant that's
being used all over the world for I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally thousands of different uses and
we couldn't grow it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I was in college and a
couple of years after so early two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands, there was this Indian
reservation that I want to say in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just by fate, their location coincides
with an old hemp farm or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's just feral hemp all over
this Indian reservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every five or 10 years, the cops would
show up and be like, you fucking you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd spend 10 days being like,
it's fucking feral hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come look around.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's harvesting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the local population got so fed up
with these like every five, six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as the cop in charge of the last
raid isn't in charge of the raids anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone sees the field from the air and
freaks out again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started coming up with
different uses for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these are the people that
really founded like hemp Crete in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were building whole houses with
everything except the glass and the
[SPEAKER_01]: doorknobs and stuff out of the hemp plant
from the concrete to the insulation to the
[SPEAKER_01]: roofing panels were pressed out of
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen the hemp Crete blocks and
they try to light them on fire and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really fire resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impressive how much heat they take.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even after they started all that,
the Fed showed up a handful of times and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're like, what's with this big weed
field?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's just we can't do anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's feral.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes back, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of that is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weird little tidbit of this that I'm
looking forward to is the feds have been
[SPEAKER_01]: including feral hemp seizures in their
average potency numbers for the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: length of marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, because I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't think anybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as far as they're concerned,
it's all cannabis and it's all the same
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal because under the law it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'd seize it, they'd test it and
they'd throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by their process of doing it is they
just grab all of the plant material and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in a trash bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then someone takes a handful of
material out of that trash bag and they
[SPEAKER_01]: test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their average potency numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves, sticks, dirt, dirt, bird nests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, when they went in and really
just tried to take the plant, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still taking from the root, the top or the
base of the stock right where it meets the
[SPEAKER_01]: root ball up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that's just a handful of that's
going into their testing mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big anti-pot talking points for
a long time is like modern marijuana is so
[SPEAKER_01]: much stronger than before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that hemp's not part of those
numbers, I'm going to laugh when the
[SPEAKER_01]: average gets really hinky over the next
couple of years when the data comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be neat to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to laugh if there's a huge spike
because the number seems low to me right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still reporting at around 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a nationwide number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, keep in mind, not everybody is
in Colorado and not everybody's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: labs that the legalized states have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in, pick a state that's got
some illegal cannabis where I can get
[SPEAKER_00]: caught with some weed and be fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the back ass words, lab equipment
in Arkansas to test for THC content.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using the same equipment that they
use for the rape kits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's decent equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how they're testing and what
they're testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also has been a part of that for
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's growing in Arkansas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's the lead grower in Little Rock?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do all their busts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to do their shit on the download.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to sneak again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to drive one dude's car to the
grow store and buy shit and then drive
[SPEAKER_00]: that car to the house and pull it in the
garage and load up the other car and drive
[SPEAKER_00]: that in and sneak it all into the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're back in that era.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well in Feral Hemp busts are all over
the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, we get at least one or two good
ones a year where the initial report is
[SPEAKER_01]: like massive marijuana field found in
middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the next day is cops
tear down 10,000 plants, 15,000 plants
[SPEAKER_01]: called a sophisticated operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A week later turns out it's Feral Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been there for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just particularly wet this spring
and so it got out of hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: More seeds germinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone noticed and yeah, it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's happened in the same spot in
Texas like 10 times since I've been an
[SPEAKER_01]: adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty common occurrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun watching all this change and
it'll be fun seeing the first hemp fields
[SPEAKER_01]: go up and then seeing the high school kids
get busted thinking that the signs that
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere is saying this is hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get stone from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't break it and kill our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are still going to hop that fence,
come in, cut a plant down and run away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get pulled over, you know, a mile later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a big old sticky, stinky plant in
their car that's not worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're trying to make a necklace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really glad this passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of foolishness kind of
in our community about this piece of the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, I didn't read it and I'm
assuming, and I had bad information before
[SPEAKER_01]: this happened and now I'm angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to put too fine a point on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that sounded like I was talking about
you, check your social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm staying silent over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were hoping that this
would mean all CBD products were a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent legal for all uses and all
marketing ploys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just an insane idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how any of this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said hemp, not CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge move for textiles,
for seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: For paper production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can make anything that we make
currently from trees, oil or cotton,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make with the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's thousands and thousands and
thousands of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most of the equipment we're using to
make this show comes from some of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: like all our clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say everything we're
sitting at the dry wall behind us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the gasoline in the car is what I use
to drive over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of it we can make with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of that's on the table for
production now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD and THC, especially if they're
marketed with any sort of health effect at
[SPEAKER_01]: all, is covered by the FDA, just like they
would be if they were any sort of other
[SPEAKER_01]: plant compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you market something in the U S with
any sort of health claim whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a mood stabilizer helps with
anxiety, depression, doesn't matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: it's helping with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's supposed to help with anything,
but fuck, I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to go through a special set of
FDA approvals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was basically the difference on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, say this is the pat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grab a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just grabbing a thing that's on my
table so that I have an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This label right here is not a food
product, but what was I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I put, uh, soothes hand pain,
suddenly I have to have an FDA thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if on the back, I just put the word
CBD in my ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it just has CBD in the ingredients,
I don't have to have an FDA stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as I make a claim,
is that when I have to add that stamp,
[SPEAKER_01]: the F and FDA is food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they also oversee shit like
cucumbers, lettuce, um, tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: popsicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have a CBD food item that
you would like to make in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_01]: sell in Washington, um, and say it was a
gummy that had CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you weren't like hyper
marketing it, you would probably just have
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through the food approvals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because at that point it's just an
ingredient like sugar or high fructose
[SPEAKER_01]: corn syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, as soon as you slap it on the
front of the package and call it like
[SPEAKER_01]: these are CBD gummies, the FDA is probably
going to be want to know like,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that a flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as that person being asked
that question starts talking, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to end up or they're going to likely
end up in, uh, a place where that would
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go through the drug approvals as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to a health food store,
all of those herbal supplements have been
[SPEAKER_01]: through most of this or all of it,
depending on what they're claiming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the little purple star and they
say FDA approved, talking about a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I worked at a health food store for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA approved doesn't mean it's a good
effective treatment for whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means that there's enough evidence
to say that that claim is probably true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's also not bad for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's kind of sesame seeds in it
and you're allergic to sesame seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not what we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, in our nation's history,
we had a huge problem with fake medicines
[SPEAKER_01]: being marketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of people in our
community that were outraged when the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: bill passed almost immediately after like
the FDA knew this was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that these issues are a cop,
a hot topic of conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they released a memo or, um,
I don't remember what they called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is to the public right after the
farm bill with science saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, this is awesome, but calm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't apply to THC and CBD,
anything marketed with those two
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically because they've been marked
as FDA compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and further anything that claims to be
a health food item, um, like it's marketed
[SPEAKER_01]: in the U S has to go through our approval
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that still applies to all this CBD
stuff that's hitting the market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the FDA has been working for a couple
of years now to rein in the CBD health
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of it's just random nonsense
claims that have no support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode called something fishy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about funky CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've found products on the market that
claim to have one thing that, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't find it or they find it in different
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says a hundred milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find not a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they find none at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sometimes they find compounds that
aren't on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reading this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a crazy report that came out with
the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're right around the same time about
a CBD bust where they went and bought up a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of the vape cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they ordered some online and they
bought some from local vendors and one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the products that kept turning up is one
of the same ones that they put in spice
[SPEAKER_01]: and K2 and that herbal crap you buy that's
fake marijuana that won't hit pop or pop
[SPEAKER_01]: hot on a drug test, but it's a synthesized
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out of some secret lab in
China or somewhere that's very similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta nine THC, but won't come up in a
standard drug screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're finding it in CB pure CBD vape
pen cartridges and shit in places like
[SPEAKER_01]: Alabama because the market is really
unscrupulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what the FDA is there for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you buy something with that
stamp that says FDA approved, that
[SPEAKER_01]: company's been inspected.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They follow rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, surprise inspections, product testing,
like rigorous fucking product testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, all of it so that it, they know that
when millions of these go out into the
[SPEAKER_01]: public, there's not going to be a crazy
scare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it's not, I don't know,
there's so many people in our community
[SPEAKER_01]: that freaked out about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh my God, look what you did now
that the FDA is going to take away CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cannabis industry is the biggest
conspiracy theorist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as soon as one thing happens,
they start projecting seven thoughts into
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may just be, you remember the old
hippie cliche to sit around and smoke a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint freak out about the government,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they fucking do for real in
our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from an honest place.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time in our history,
if you stood up and were pro cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were risking a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only people that stood up had
nothing to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people with nothing to lose,
usually like they never had anything to
[SPEAKER_01]: lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they have nothing to lose
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily the best
spokesman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that didn't help us at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our fringe and black market conspiracy
theories have always been part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something about that type of person,
the black market grower, the recluse,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all like super extra paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to stand and peek out the windows
and then your only friend is the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube starts telling me that everyone's
watching you and that the Illuminati wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to steal your bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts getting weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the farm bill, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions about the farm bill,
other provisions, if you want me to
[SPEAKER_01]: elaborate more about what it means for
tech style production or what other stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make from hemp, like you can
Google most of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to tweet at me,
it's at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nemopunk15 on the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or also what about Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have to search for that one a
little harder if you're not already
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with the Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, are they blocking the cannabis pages?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Facebook's been doing that for months
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: No search for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe six, eight months.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year ago, Facebook decided to make it
much harder to find anything cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: related, which made me laugh my ass off
because both sides of the conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to use the words cannabis or
marijuana names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of the anti pot and cannabis
pages vanished just as thoroughly as all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it got to play fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to play fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this farm bill, do you see in the
future that hemp will be tested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same manner as cannabis, not just for
cannabinoid content to ensure that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not hot is the word we use for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got too much THC, we call it hot
and it's got to be destroyed or
[SPEAKER_00]: reallocated for different purposes,
or it can be concentrated, ran into a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that concentrate can be separated
out and be separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I learned recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel that they will be doing
pesticide testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends what the crops being
produced for, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to go through very separate
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you buy, um, hold hemp seed at the
health food store, which you've been able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do for decades, it goes through the
same food testing as the sunflower seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: at the gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no Michael butanol in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they fucking shouldn't be,
um, the same things with the textiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you buy a hemp tee shirt,
a cotton shirt at the mall or online or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, it should have gone,
all the material that went into that
[SPEAKER_01]: should have gone through the same testing
as the cotton shirt or the polyester shirt
[SPEAKER_01]: that you bought too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will, in the future, all of the
hemp will have to be tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's currently not to my best
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we went out to one of the local
hemp farms, they don't have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do have to adhere to department of
agriculture, pesticide rules and laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, there's no testing for
pesticide presence or mold and mildews
[SPEAKER_00]: like we also test for in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't test for any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd, I look forward to when they have
to test for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, sorry, you guys in the hemp industry,
we're a smokable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be eating a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned earlier, it goes into gummy
bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it goes into a salve or I have
family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to call anybody out and get
anybody in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a family member who has very bad
arthritis and they use a lotion quite
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them rubbing fucking
fluoramide lotion into their skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that should go through all the same
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that everything else goes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the, the big upsides to federal
legalization, um, that we just got with
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp is we already solved all those
fucking problems for 90% of what we deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't have these worries when you
buy a shirt or a hat or shoes online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never think were these socks treated
with pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I make a point to wash new clothes
when they come into my house, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more like a paranoia thing because there's
like three episodes of shows I watched as
a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the plot line was like kid gets sick
from jeans that didn't get washed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already solved all these pro like
for food safety, for clothing and textile
[SPEAKER_01]: safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these rules are already in place for a
thousand other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just weren't allowed to use that
infrastructure for hemp because hemp was
[SPEAKER_01]: federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a schedule one substance,
just like, um, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, the farm bill actually removed
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp from schedule one and changed the
official wording of our federal drug
[SPEAKER_01]: statutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's what I mean when I say
that it's weird that the DEA, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the drug czar's office and all of that
federal machinery did not fuck all to say
[SPEAKER_01]: about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when they were quiet about it is this
was leading up to, is it going to get put
[SPEAKER_01]: in the farm bill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's in, is it going to get passed by
the Senate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to get passed by the house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, is the president going to sign it?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people like me that had been following
this for 20 years were like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: where's the normal course of dipshits?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really kind of big news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did once again, I'm going back to the
devil's advocate was at the right hand
[SPEAKER_00]: going like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the left hand can come over here and
pull some shit while we were going,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the farm bill thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the farm bill thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're over here just fucking
merchandise out the back door.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like when they're doing
something for a distraction, they shout
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some sparkle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some waving.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some blood, something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this, there was just like,
Hey, you know, we've got bipartisan
[SPEAKER_01]: support for a farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was like, yeah, but what
about, and they were like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just doing this real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: End of the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro cannabis news outlets and a couple
others were like, yay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hems legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the FDA was like, yeah, but CBD and
THC are under the same rules that applied
[SPEAKER_01]: as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty much it outside of the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even the people like Dr. Bronner's
weren't like, man, I was going to bring up
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bronner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make a joke early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody heard from Dr. Bronner?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his company, I kind of expected someone
from his company or from a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: industry to be like, you know,
we're really thrilled about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more tonight at nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use that Dr. Bronner soap every single
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own a number of clothing items that I've
had for, for years because they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just last longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pay a little more, but it never wears
out ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good hemp quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to see what I'm wearing now
and there's no hemp on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my socks may be hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known countless people that were into
that Dr. Bronner soap though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that made me
laugh is a shout out to the Dreadlock
[SPEAKER_01]: crew, the anti-pop crowd kind of freaked
out with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, you know, I'm sure this
is just backdoor legalization again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the farm bills, you know,
like, the Hemp brand was like the best
brand ever.
Until I found out that that was the brand
that actually did that, which is really
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And th a start I found out that was Hemp
brand.
So I was like, man, this is really,
this is really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this hemp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it Target the other day and it
was, it was actually the Hemp brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just laugh so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, wait, you're half the age of
my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been using that lotion the whole
time and been alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think this has something to do
with a farm bill that goes into effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: January.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even January.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're just so fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well once you're against something
you're against it and once you're
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed you're programmed and unless
you get reprogrammed or unprogrammed you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true for most topics, but like at
this point anyone who cares enough to have
[SPEAKER_01]: an opinion either way has checked on it a
little bit and the only people left in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardcore anti-camp are either a long time
ago they committed to a life of talking
[SPEAKER_01]: bad about pot and getting paid for it and
that's their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they go outside of that at all they
have to come up with a whole new
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those people have that story of
how, I sound like an asshole right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: how one of their friends drank 17 beers at
a party and smoked a joint and then left
[SPEAKER_00]: and got in a wreck and killed themselves
and they blame cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big one, Kevin Sabet, just he figured
out when he was in college that he could
[SPEAKER_01]: get people to give him money for being the
guy that wears a suit and is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of likable and marijuana is
terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's made a pretty good life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a basic good description of that
guy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wear a suit and kind of likable.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's worked for three presidents,
two or three presidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he might have worked two
administrations for Bush and then one for
[SPEAKER_01]: Obama I think is his his claim to fame,
but he might have been Clinton Bush Obama.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he worked for the drug czar's office
for a while and now he's got a company
[SPEAKER_01]: where people just give him money that they
worked hard for so that he can continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: go around the country and bash legal weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he about five years ago made a point
to stop taking donations from these
[SPEAKER_01]: people's companies that like drug test or
run rehabs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he only takes checks from the person
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like if, Jeff, if you were to send
me a check in this manner, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: send it from Irie Genetics, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would send it from Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that way I could be like,
I only take donations from private
[SPEAKER_01]: citizens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take corporate money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a cute little play that he's been
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where this tangent came from,
but enjoy that tidbit folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to start segueing since
I'm getting Mike a dab ready anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, thank you for enduring 38.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much of that got edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 38 minutes of a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's you should finish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's my report on the farm bill
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you had to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I get why a lot of people can't
wade through this shit on their own and
[SPEAKER_01]: make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's designed to be really
complicated and kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just tried to kill Mike with the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to give him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to rethink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need all the dads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like a small one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just knock most of this off
the dabber and give you the part that
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put this back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was hilarious that Mike came
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good bird part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I appreciate your presence on the
show, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stood up for you before that shit is
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, there are people, some people got
bored as fuck, but some people are really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was for, if you got bored,
then there'll be a Monday show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be about growing Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've probably seen 300 people online in
our community arguing about what the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: bill did and didn't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 299 of them had no fucking idea what
they were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad to help clear up the air for
anyone who wanted to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we brought you here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to give you a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point in the show, I gave Mike a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is probably still coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find Mike on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you find him on Facebook at
Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find him on Twitter.
