[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.

[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is time for episode 587 of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're watching on YouTube,
I'm sure you could tell by now that white
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.

[SPEAKER_00]: Try to stand the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.

[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to be a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some setup changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got it figured out,

pretty soon and make him look as sharp as
[SPEAKER_01]: I do also.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't record as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get them up to speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, in this episode, we're going to
talk about edibles, a quite often

podcasting realm.

episode.

[SPEAKER_01]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did mention at the start of the show
that we're going to talk about edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you noticed during the
shout outs, the fucking edibles are
[SPEAKER_01]: working, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually start the show by talking about
what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what we have eaten and
what we've consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, what are you going in on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what did you eat this evening,
this afternoon before the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: The edible I've been obsessed with lately
are these gummy candies made right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo, Taste Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you on YouTube, I just held
it up for the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are some blue raspberry sativa,
just 10 milligram gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a big guy like me, you care
about quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ever in Colorado, the quality of the
candy you get here was shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a minute, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first company that was like,
we're really going to put together a good
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's what I've been
waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been a fan since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said those are made here in
Pueblo, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you told me about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feels good that you're supporting a
local product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where this product was grown
or made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where I bought it and it was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, I ate a, maybe possibly a little bit
too much of a caramel and corn coda bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cannabis, cannabis infused
chocolate bar, a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: A THC and zero milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate, I think I've had about 20 or 40,
I ate 20 milligrams of it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we started the show and I'm going to
eat more of it as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had 20, I'm going to eat a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to eat up to 40 because
I've noticed that lately 50 is right about
[SPEAKER_01]: where I start getting a little bit silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't dab, 50 is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I eat 50 milligrams and take a dab,
dude, then I'm like, Oh, should I need a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and that's fun sometimes,
but I got shit to do, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't think I'm going to go 40 and a
couple of dabs and we'll see what that
[SPEAKER_01]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I only ate 20 for tonight's
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I knew I was going to be hitting my
pen and taking a couple of dabs and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to get over medicated,
which I'll do that with edibles too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard, not hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I'm going to crack this open
and make sure that I'm not lying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ate 20 and I'm going to eat 20 more
as the show goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when back in the day, when it was a,
a cookie, your friend made that tasted
[SPEAKER_00]: like feet and leave something from under
the lawnmower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it was harder to over consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everything's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These chocolate candies are really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've gotten myself into a little
trouble just enjoying what I purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, five or six deep,
you're like, oops, I'm going to call and
[SPEAKER_00]: cancel some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said edibles from back in the day that
tasted like poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when they just tasted just like
green, green plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like why does it taste like I'm eating
green plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people were just putting weed in the
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't put just weed in your
Brownie mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put, make some butter and put the butter
or some, just drop some shatter in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Brownie mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stir that in real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some, put a bunch of distillate in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't just go put a bunch of weed in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that to the cooking oil, the butter
the recipe calls for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, not a bunch of, we're not,
we're not horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to graze on a bunch of
greens like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get enough greens in my diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not eat a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can if you want to,
but that's, that's not the way I recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've eaten some edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to eat more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a good spot to start with talking
about edibles, Mike might be the basic
[SPEAKER_01]: number one thing dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, learn your dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe people are jumping into edibles for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying know your dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't fucking know my dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't even get edibles where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learn your dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to learn your dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to say, start off with like 10
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say maybe start off with five
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it all depends on your tolerance
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was working a retail counter as
a bud tender edibles, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: would like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't smoked in 30 years crowd and I
just retired and I want to get back into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles seem like a softer, I don't have
to smoke anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I protected my lungs type option to get
back into cannabis or to to dip your toe
[SPEAKER_00]: into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, it's so, so easy to overdo it when
you're, when you're eating it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a non-consumer consuming for
the first time at all, it's so,
[SPEAKER_00]: so easy to consume more than will be
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the joke that Mike and I both
made is you can't uneat that second dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you eat, eat five or 10 milligrams
and give it a solid hour before you see
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've eaten the edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably 40 minutes ago and I'm just now
barely starting to feel it kick in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure in like the next 20 minutes,
it's going to get me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to start moving in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to feel warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: My eyes are getting a little heavy on my
attention is moving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an edible show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fucking professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm the worst thing that's going to
happen is I'm going to get too high and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to make a shitty podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not going to have to call my mom
and get help or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people, if this is their first
experience and they get that, Oh God,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could ruin the whole idea of using it
for medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may make them gun shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the first experience with
something sucks, we could totally ruin it
[SPEAKER_01]: for them forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, eat that first dose and give it a
solid hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you don't feel it,
wait a little bit longer and eat another
[SPEAKER_01]: small dose because you don't want to
realize about an hour and 20 in that both
[SPEAKER_01]: of those doses are kicking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's when it gets shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a legalization area,
you should be able to buy store bought
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles that are lab tested for
consistency, potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy to identify how much of your
candy bar cookie or brownie or candy is
[SPEAKER_00]: five milligrams, 10 milligrams,
20 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to show this, this candy bar,
this was a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's divided into obvious small pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of those triangles is a little five
milligram piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know just by breaking off one of
those five milligram pieces, I know
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what I'm eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just popped a five milligram piece into
my mouth a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know exactly how much medicine I'm
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to underdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One beautiful gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the stamp on it to show you how
much it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it in my poorly lit studio,
but it says right on the front,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligrams THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I should say it says THC exclamation
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you see on the bottle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is printed on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to pick it up and show it to
you again, but it melted on my fingers on
[SPEAKER_00]: every edible in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These have that stamped on there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says THC with an exclamation point and
it says coda on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that every bite of this is a THC
laden chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no hiding it, maybe if it melted,
but that's, that's a totally different
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a bitch for me to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an adult and this was still hard for
me to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kids getting into this would be a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the little division.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regs we did was making it hard to get into
covering it in labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my only, one of my only complaints
about the Colorado edible industry is I
[SPEAKER_01]: have dietary restrictions and I am
breaking by my diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're my own restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I place them on myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to flex those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to be flexible with them to consume
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't fit into my general
guidelines of my dietary restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish there were more things available.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my, what I'm looking for, but if I
want to get good and medicated,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to eat some chocolate or some
gummies or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I opted for chocolate to be my,
dude, honestly, since I've been eating on
[SPEAKER_01]: the diet that I'm on, this chocolate is
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have anything could be infused
in Colorado and then that scared the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put some brackets around what we
can infuse and what we can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the ganja gourmet back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a few options though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for something special
or you want to try something unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take some time on something like
weed maps and find something that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything recreational in Colorado
will be a hundred milligrams of package,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligrams a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've never consumed before,
it's super easy to say, Oh, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take half a piece and start with five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're a regular, regular consumer,
it's easy to start with 20, 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 25 in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start slow and build slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun to eat a couple edibles
and go for a nice ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fun to get way too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Jeff mentioned before,
the saying is you can't uneat drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once it's in the tummy, you're on the
roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no putting your hand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no getting off the roller coaster
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on that fucker until she comes to a
stop on its own volition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be seven hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much did you eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some tears and some diapers involved in
that ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some famous instances of people
coming to Colorado and over consuming and
[SPEAKER_00]: then writing about it for major
publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should take the time to read those
accounts or to go on YouTube and type in
[SPEAKER_00]: cop calls, 911 after eating pot brownie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highly recommend if you can get some
store bought edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, if your friend makes edibles,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're new at it, let's get
something from the store because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, Mike may have put a gram of some
concentrate and some edibles and stirred
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, those are, there was 85
grams of milligrams of THC in that
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then that means there's 85 in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are six pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows if that was really what was in
that concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows if Mike stirred it all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows if I got the piece on the corner
with all of the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows if Mike got the piece with all
the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know not everybody, some people are
in places where that's not an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're giving me the finger saying,
I'm going to take what I can get,
[SPEAKER_01]: do that, enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got the option, the world's
not spoiled like us, but if you've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: option, a lot of the States have become
spoiled like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is kind of an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I don't even, I just,
this was a side branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even on my paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're getting, if you're in another
state and you're buying edibles that look
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're from Colorado, be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's just a Hershey bar or
something that your homie made that they
[SPEAKER_01]: got some, they ate all the good edibles
from the Colorado packaging and repackaged
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit and just sent it along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your edibles come in suspiciously
familiar packaging, like if it says
[SPEAKER_01]: reefers instead of Snickers on it,
or instead of Reese's, that's probably not
[SPEAKER_01]: a legit store bought edible because all
those have been stopped because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good way to tell that,
Hey, I'm buying a weird edible right here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I prefer a lab tested edible,
something made in a Colorado regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of picky about not only what I'll
eat, but who I will eat from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not to be weird with it,
but like we're fucking old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't accidentally get too glazed
and miss 36 hours of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got two kids, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go AWOL for 36 hours, I wake up with
like cops looking for shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bueno for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and so like I used to work with a
dude who made fire edibles and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: always happy to gobble one down,
but like now I'd make sure it was a really
[SPEAKER_00]: safe moment to eat one of those where I
could miss 10 hours in BI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the store buy, you can avoid
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know exactly what my experience is
going to be regardless of if I got the
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee and donuts or if I got gummies or
breath strips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I'm 30 milligrams in now and I
know that I can handle that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't accidentally consume the
bottom Brownie or the fucking bottom scoop
[SPEAKER_01]: with something with all the potency in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mine are getting me right behind the
eyes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm enjoying the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bright lights, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bright lights and edibles are a fun
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also if anybody's saying, why aren't
you recording with the fancy camera?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for a piece of equipment so I
can link up to Sony camera so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: could zoom with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in for a camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today you guys probably a relief on your
eyes to not be seeing me in 4k for once,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly prefer the store bought edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my last note that we went over.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get them, if not eat what you
can, dude, good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making them, make sure you stir
that shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want one Brownie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all of the potency one Brownie that
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get online and take some time and try to
get your dose in where you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: concept of what it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard myself with homemade edibles
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have, we all have, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know any of those people that say
edibles simply don't work on them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like edibles just don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you recommend for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to Colorado and get one of those a
thousand milligram bars at a shop and eat
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole thing and hang out with me and
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if they say it doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I like to do with the
new product is, you know, ID 10 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two hours later I eat 20 and then
two hours later I eat 30, two hours later
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat 40 and just let that roller coaster
ride begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually Ted don't do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the time I'm eating 40 at a chunk,
like game on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the people that say edibles don't
work for me, it's usually, they bought an
[SPEAKER_00]: undetermined quality of pot at some point
and somehow tried to make food with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what their edibles don't work
on me story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, did you put it in the
oven at 375 for 40 minutes and just burn
[SPEAKER_00]: out all the THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you get a shitty eight,
the mids, and then put it into a too big a
[SPEAKER_00]: tray?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was only seven milligrams per
brownie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I see people that also buy an
edible and they say, well, I ate part of
[SPEAKER_01]: it before I went into work and then part
of it at lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave part of it to my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, so nobody got high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just spread fucking a bunch of
milligrams around so far that nothing you
[SPEAKER_01]: ate like three before lunch and three at
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody microdosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody felt a goddamn thing from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that as sort of a thing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get, you can get pills here in Colorado
that are just 10 milligram pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to love those throughout the
day and more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, did I take some at the beginning of
my lunch break or at the end of my lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: break?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take two more on my way back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right before third break,
you said they're holding onto the counter,
[SPEAKER_00]: like trying to maintain eye contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did take those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did take those other edibles.
Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took someone at the start of my break,
in the middle of the break, and at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm fucking glazed like a ham.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were talking, you said a minute ago
about putting the herb in the oven or
[SPEAKER_01]: putting the brownie mix in the oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about decarbing and
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sound like Joe Rogan for a
minute here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys have all heard this rant from
Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something different happens when you eat
medical cannabis or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not become, when normal cannabis,
when you consume it, when you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you consume Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you the buzz that you're used
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably CBD and other
cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then one we're fucking familiar with
is the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you eat that, your body converts it
into 11 hydroxy THC or hydroxy THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes it more psychoactive,
more bioavailable to your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it longer lasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it deeper penetrating is
something that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about why I said that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is the scientific thing of what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you get a different buzz from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes something different in your
liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your liver heats it up, processes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes this hydroxy THC, which is
different than Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different compound, different buzz,
treats you differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that leads me into talking about
decarbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take cannabis flowers,
if you're going to make edibles,
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to be decarbed to make it more
bioavailable for your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just took a bunch of weed and ate
it, you may get a little bit of buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took that weed and heated it to the
appropriate temperature to activate those
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, you would get a much better
buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that happens in the cooking or
baking process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times it will be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it happens in the extraction
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making a concentrate,
it'll kind of decarb there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you may need to decarb your
product on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making a butter or something,
you may need to decarb that butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something you need to research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't make edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an edible professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're making edibles, decarbing,
decarboxylation is something I highly
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend you do some research on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what makes that Delta 11 available
in your body even more bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another thing called
nano-infusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand nano-infusion
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of what I read, some people say it's
not good to consume nano-infused products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So read about nano-infusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried a product that was a liquid syrupy
type product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even like talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like sauce or syrup is what it's
trying to act like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can just pour a little bit of this
stuff in a cup and drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't even drink it like sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just drink it like itself and know that
you're going to get lit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a thousand milligrams of
nano-infused drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I drank just a little sip of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could feel it hit my body too
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, that was fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's scary high, scary quickly to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could really mess myself up with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to get medicated super
quickly, check out the nano-infused drink
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're available in California,
not in Colorado that I know of because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're so potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so you got to decarb things and then
check out nano-infusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my quick, the part that I did
write a couple of detailed notes about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike, it looks like you got something
to say, bail me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the edibles, the sum up version of
what Jeff just said is the edibles hit
[SPEAKER_00]: harder and last longer than smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing when you're smoking it,
you can, it's called titrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can titrate your dose a lot smoother
and a lot more precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of a good analogy
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's the edibles that are
fucking me up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just threw a piece of candy in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking is like paying for stuff with
loose change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can be super precise,
but edibles is like paying for stuff with
[SPEAKER_00]: gold bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's going to be a lot of,
like waiting around for your change to
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not precise at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go with a big old chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you dial it in, I've seen so many
people roast themselves with edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to get vegetable oil that was
infused by someone else in college and the
[SPEAKER_00]: brownies we would make just had a
reputation for like, sometimes it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, mild, pleasant, and other times it
was like a sledgehammer with a forehead
[SPEAKER_00]: for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people do the same with the
store-bought edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stop thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You intend to eat 30 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you know, like something
funny happened in front of you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: television or on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're 60 milligrams deep before
you realize what you're doing.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with good candy like what I'm
munching on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the downside is that they come on super
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can take you into a different
realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Joey Diaz says, you can fucking see
the devil or you could see God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on what the fuck, which edibles
you ate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why they're so useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're so helpful for the
medical community or for, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get high off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get real high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to take four dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I were going to go somewhere and
didn't want to go dab, I could just take
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these with me and just sneak it
into my mouth and we'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very, it's longer lasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really, once you dial in
your dosage, I think it's cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The edibles aren't too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to how much I smoke and what my
smoke products cost compared to what the
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles cost, it's still cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It mats out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it goes, this may be a
weird way to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it goes deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I've got some pain, I can smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I've got like level six back pain,
it'll take it to like a three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you got level seven back pain and
you eat edibles, it'll knock you down to a
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the edibles are just nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, they're swimming around in
your body going, Oh, it hurts over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it hurts over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My knees and my back are really hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go with edibles to attack the pain,
not smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all sitting here and dab for all
afternoon, trying to get rid of knee pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I chewed out a CBD gummy and four
or five THC, 10 milligrams, so I'm at like
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 and 50, within an hour and a half,
my knee pain will be dialed back to a two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like the CBD inhibits the
giggly, fun time buzz from the THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but makes it more focused on the pain
relief?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work really, really well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does tend to dial back the stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other phenomena I wanted to
bring up on this episode, ask you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've experienced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've experienced it repeatedly lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty good at knowing where my
tolerance is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm smoking flour, dabs, edibles,
and I'll be riding like a nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasant, like three or four level high,
like out of 10, I'm just rocking out at a
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four, maintaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then something environmental-wise
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes me to a fucking nine,
just out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I end up just laughing hysterically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's usually laughing hysterically
or destroying a bunch of food out of
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love when you eat edibles, and then go
somewhere and you're at like the mall or
[SPEAKER_01]: at the sneaker shop or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh, wait, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's those edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got me just now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, wait, this is going to be,
I gotta get out of the mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta leave Target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where's my car?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just ditch your shopping cart and
you just fucking bail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got into this gummy brand,
I met the owner doing a political campaign
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like two months later,
the holidays came around and I needed
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was going to be even more
discreet than a vapor pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, there's nothing more discreet
than gummies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found myself slightly
over-medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, now go get seconds at Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of a perfect fortuitous
little moment for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you still go get seconds, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best thing when you're
over-medicated is food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I had a black market edible,
I thought I was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was scrolling through one of those,
like, here's 12 funny memes about whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even anything particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wouldn't have hit me like this in
any other moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with my medicated level, and the
situation I was in, I about died in a
[SPEAKER_00]: parking lot behind a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody else was in the next room
eating chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the back just curled up on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: TikTok isn't that funny until you eat
edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even TikTok.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a regular ass picture and word
meme list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was hitting me like Tyson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles are wonderful for that,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take an afternoon from
ordinary to extraordinary, I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: some fucking edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to take a break because I worked
with a group of savages and we were all
[SPEAKER_01]: just eating way too many edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: People didn't listen to the podcast back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of milligrams do not belong on a
single piece of bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a bacon consumer, but there were
thousand milligram edibles eaten during
[SPEAKER_01]: work shifts and work did get done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of it, but the work was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your favorite stories involves
somebody getting too glazed to sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a performer do it,
but I've seen a lot of other people who
[SPEAKER_00]: had shit to do that was like, nope,
they had one too many brownies and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to stay on the couch till
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually were at a dab event and there
was a rapper who raps about dabs and he
[SPEAKER_01]: took a dab on stage and had to have the
crowd come up and karaoke his songs for
[SPEAKER_01]: him because he was dabbed the fuck out and
couldn't sing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll fuck up your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, I feel like I've covered
all of my bullet points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any notes written down that
you'd like to cover or is it time to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: it into a ramble fest here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about going easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought up that it seems like a kinder,
gentler reintroduction or introduction to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but because of your inability to
slowly dose yourself, it tends not to be
[SPEAKER_00]: that gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are the main points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got all the business part
covered up on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fun show, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good edible lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope people learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got edibled out, so I'm not sure how
much we taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly, I was just sitting here
thinking how long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I realized how hard the
edibles have hit me and I honestly can't
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you how long we've been talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what time it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still read the clock, but I don't
remember what time we hit go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to tell you because I like
the level of confusion in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should definitely reach out and
interact with us on social media if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got edible questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great thing for a great segue for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to reach out to us,
if you've got corrections, questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: comments, updates, or concerns,
my email address is
[SPEAKER_01]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reach Mike at Nemopunk15 on
Twitter is probably the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just drank a bunch of water and it's
trying to make me burp while I'm speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you feel like the episode was
educational, informative, or entertaining,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would appreciate it if you support us
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me at patreon.com forward
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's Patreon is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could you forget that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Support white Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not done with the show, but I thought
it'd be a good time to shout out all that
[SPEAKER_01]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good time to drop the contact info in case
y'all want to reach out and laugh at us
[SPEAKER_00]: for being too glazed to remember what our
last couple bullet points in the edible
[SPEAKER_00]: show were.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I did the Patreon and the email
addresses now, just in case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got notes, but they've gone to shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all half crossed out, half out of
order now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been doing paper notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone mostly digital on the new
podcast format.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I'm doing the Zoom, I've got UR on
my note screen right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to go paperless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd be a little bit more
cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one or two sheets of paper every
episode that I'm not wasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be more cost-effective,
more environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I doing it on paper like a caveman
anyway?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got digital stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We upgraded all the toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new studio sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That microphone sounds crispy with my
headphones today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sound pretty great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a fucking good job staying on the
mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got you turned up pretty hot over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the listeners can hear me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sounded great to us, the shows where
they said they couldn't hear me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This new device, shout out to the pod
track P4, makes us both sound pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the new piece of tech making
me sound crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 milligrams of edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I feel about 20 or 30 of them
right now moving through my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: My palms are getting a little bit sweaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: My eyes are a little bit heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to hang on and just keep
podcasting for a few so that we could see
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens to us over the course of this
podcast here over the next few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grab an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do some rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't prepare anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not prepare anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about, here's some fun shit we
could talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't fuck this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't miss any notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can give a huge shout out to our
friend, Karen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace, Karen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Tom also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about when we used to manage a
dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I had the, and some other
friends, it wasn't just Mike and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a group of us that managed and
ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the fucking general manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess would have been if there was a
real title in that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the fucking, the guy that did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom was the owner guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the guy right under Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Mike was right next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a couple other people
to work with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chrisann was like everybody's fucking like
second right-hand man.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tree was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tom was the owner and Karen was Tom's
wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: She unfortunately passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We miss you, Karen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always got a fucking spot in my heart
for Karen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but love for that lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was one of the sweetest people I've
ever interacted with, like genuinely
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet, caring, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: She also made a wicked edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: She made baked goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: She made fudge, candies, anything,
not just medicated, but she could make
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: She cooked and she was just a sweet lady
that loved to nourish people.
[SPEAKER_01]: She made amazing medicated edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fudge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said that fudge two or three times
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fudge was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The banana bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Christmas cookies with the sprinkles
on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the banana bread, the walnut bread was
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another kind of nut bread that she
made that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would serve us full meals and
everything in the meal was medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: She would make, so we had a dispensary and
back in the day you could- First time I
[SPEAKER_01]: ever saw medicated barbecue sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then you could make edibles in your
private kitchen at home and take them and
[SPEAKER_01]: sell them in your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how long ago this was.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the wild, wild west in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely no rule days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just, however, we were inventing
the rules as we went.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were making the rules around us is
what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Karen would make trays of fudge and banana
bread and cookies and medicated cupcakes
[SPEAKER_01]: with medicated frosting, with medicated
sprinkles and medicated syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: She would bring all these edibles to the
office where we work and she would have a
[SPEAKER_01]: pile of, here's a cupcake for Mike and a
cupcake for Jeff and medicated fudge for
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and fudge for Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of everything for everybody that works
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of everything for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would encourage you to try all of
them while you're at work today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would start off my work shift with a
medicated cupcake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned before, the cupcake is
medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The frosting is medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: She put medication in the fucking
sprinkles, then put medicated syrup over
[SPEAKER_01]: it and then served me a drink with fucking
ganja and that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm washing down my medicated fucking
cupcake with a medicated chocolate soy
[SPEAKER_01]: milk or some shit back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would get lit by lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so roasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would come check on us and be
like, so what did you eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I ate the cupcake and I'm
lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she'd be like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now go eat the fudge and the two cookies
and the glazed ham and the fucking other
[SPEAKER_01]: nine items I gave you and let us know what
you think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, I can't handle it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would encourage it and not even
mind that sometimes I'd be working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of a shift and just put my hands on
my face and be like, I need a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too high to even, I shouldn't even be
fucking standing in public right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got me serving customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like give me just a minute to get my life
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were cool with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, ha ha, he ate too many of the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, those were good old times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Karen and Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where Mike and I met each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I distinctly remember standing behind that
counter, holding onto the underside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter, putting positive pressure with my
arms, pushing my feet down on the ground a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gravity was pushing me normally just
to make sure I was all good for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were definitely some fun times in
that I fell down the stairs at that
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a couple of nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a 180 degree turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go down one and then he turned 180
and go down another turn 180 and go down
[SPEAKER_01]: another instead of just one long fucking
death fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a few death falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell down one and made the turn and fell
down another flight too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like actually made the fucking turn while
I was falling, but I was so high on
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like that drunk driver that gets in
a car wreck and all the sober people die,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the drunk driver is so gumby'd that he
just fucking rubbers around in the car and
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was me as I fell down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just gumby legs, jello rolled down that
fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little job blessing and a little
rubber roll going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fell down the stairs high as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Metamar Ministries in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many firsts in that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the edibles, oh good Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time I learned the
edibles could really be like amazingly
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I was making in college,
every time, especially when we were using
[SPEAKER_00]: the real potent oil, it's just that heavy
green chlorophyll flavor you can't escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff Karen was making was
legitimately delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it would have sold as a regular food
item anywhere comfortably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would lay you the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people knew that if they watched
those cookies on the shelf, if those
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies didn't sell by Friday,
that when you come in on Friday,
[SPEAKER_01]: that old lady comes in Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeff will give you cookies Friday
evening if you buy a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every Friday, like that after work
rush, if there were 10 or 12 cookies left,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you bought an ounce, here's a cookie,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you were cool, like if you're just,
there's some people that came in,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are dicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working at that dispensary, randomly
stacks of pizzas would show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just Pizza Hut would be like, Hey,
this guy named Jake sent you 12 pizzas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jake's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Jake and his girlfriend,
they come in here all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next time you see Jake, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets two fucking medicated cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he just sent me pizzas last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to get all kinds of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were maybe 30 dispensaries in the
country then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were only four or six in the state
of Colorado at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was before anything existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The broadster dam explosion happened on
Broadway in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called it little broadster dam
because suddenly there were dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: on every other block.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we hired you to come work
with our dispensary so that I could get
[SPEAKER_01]: some time off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hired a couple other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working seven days a week from open
to close as the only bud tender and the
[SPEAKER_01]: only guy there basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we had a couple other people hired
on and then the owner was giving me
[SPEAKER_01]: funding on the weekends to go scout out
other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like go to every shop that you can within
this many miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drive up to Denver and fucking go hit
10 or 12 dispenser.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't even 10 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd go hit four or five because that's
all there were at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go hit four or five dispensaries,
buy a couple of products from each one and
[SPEAKER_01]: then bring it down and show it to the
owner of the dispensary.
You know, It's like, I'm, I don't,
I'm not a fan of that.
I don't know about that.
But, but it's, it's a lot of people that I
know who are in the dispensary.
And they're saying, you know, we're not a
fan of dispensaries.
And I'm like, okay, we're going to check
out other dispensaries and see if we can
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about how we can get better products
and how we can set up like those
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing recon work on that shit
since 2008, 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a good time doing all that going
and checking out other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buying crazy, good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some terrible products back in the day
going to buy edibles that were inedible
[SPEAKER_00]: distance from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, literally it was get up,
tie your shoes, stroll up the block,
[SPEAKER_00]: open the world's first weed store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fucking fantasy, like it seems like a
dream at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before there were rules, there's a lot
of fucking funny, a lot of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That staircase, I don't know how none of
us died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eating three or four pieces of banana
bread in the shift and then having to run
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the fourth floor, grab more or
something for, nah, it should have killed
[SPEAKER_00]: one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the heat up on that fourth floor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever go in the basement of that
building?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got, you've got to- One through
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never went to, I never went to B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a random side rant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's ever been in that building.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of, maybe some people have been in
that building that are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too many though.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first dispensary in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one in the county outside of our
city limits that was open at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we were getting the majority
of the business and then a couple others
[SPEAKER_01]: opened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to say their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I only got the pleasure of working
there for like six weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally when I started, there was
one and it was Metamar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was another one talking about
opening their doors in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one you're thinking of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was five or six weeks later when
the city shut us down, there were like
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our one friend opened two shops up pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the year there were 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were driving up to Inver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the first regulation bill
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say the first regulation bill
happened in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we went from a thousand
shops to 500 essentially overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rules took a little while to kick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a six month period where
like they rolled out the first five big
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those rules crushed so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was one after the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Reefer disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spinning sign people's, all those
stores disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's elaborate on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's going, what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, we called it the wild,
wild west.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could grow, you could get herb from
basically anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was growing at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you got a medical marijuana card,
you could increase your plant count
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could grow pretty decent quantities
of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could backpack up four a quarter
pounds of herb and stop it for four
[SPEAKER_01]: different dispensaries and sell four a
quarter pounds for cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would hand me just cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more between 700 and a thousand dollars
cash for a quarter pound of good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would leave, get in the car,
drive to the next spot and do it until I
[SPEAKER_01]: was out of herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every harvest, just go dump them off at
the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there were a million Jeffs running
around the state to the handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually it was like a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every shop had different herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a lot of people running
around and getting the various kinds of
herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state was just like, there's no
rule, there's nothing regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no rules yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state was pretending like the industry
didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the industry kept creating their
own rules in hopes that when the state
[SPEAKER_00]: finally did look upon us, They weren't as
horrified as they otherwise might be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It led to a lot of silliness at the time,
but, um, I mean, it was just the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: storm of like balls or chutzpah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sick of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm just going to turn a blind
eye from the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you talk to a lot of law
enforcement, which I ended up doing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was doing city council stuff,
by the time we had a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: registry and cards, they were like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a look for cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I'm tired of them saying they've got
a card and then I've got to fucking look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the card and then they've got a plant
count and then they can have so many,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just, you say weed, I say,
I'm here for the guns or the heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just exploded overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from first, there was one store
South of Colorado Springs that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and they were on the news every
fucking night for like four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every night it was the same report
where the guy was like, yeah, medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to get it without being
a good gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the weird bullshit thing we've come
up with to pretend this is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sort of falls under the framework
of Colorado's medical marijuana law,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was purposefully written to be a
little bit confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the news people were just aghast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should go up and pull the footage if
you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll laugh your ass off if you're not
familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember the name of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's Michael Lee was the owner of
the place, but do you remember the name of
[SPEAKER_01]: that dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the B-roll footage of cars
getting off the highway and pulling up in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of the building, but I can't
remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while they were tracking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were to sign, like if you signed up
with them for them to grow your medical
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, they would have six plants with
your name tag on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would try to keep track that bud
all the way to a storage bin with your
[SPEAKER_00]: name on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only you could come in and buy from
that bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was one of those, you know,
if the state ever is like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really just a big drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say like, no, patients and
medical program.
[SPEAKER_01]: The caregiver program.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we operated.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Metomar, we tried to call it a
caregiver program because like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike was a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I can't grow weed, but you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will assign you my plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I get Mike's medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_01]: He assigns me as the caregiver on the
card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to grow his six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, every time he comes to my dispensary,
since I'm growing his six plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: he gets medicine every time he comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because back in the day, it was hard to
keep up with medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you sign us up as your caregiver,
we'll give you bonuses and extras and
[SPEAKER_01]: gifts, which now is kind of frowned upon
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've regulated that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so that's how that used to work
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just grow a shit ton of weed
and it wouldn't be a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they came up with vertical
integration was one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: crushed a lot of the businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, you could just buy it and
get it from wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it had to come 70% of your product had
to be produced by you in a cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: facility that you were involved with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can only buy 30% outside product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That messed up a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that were just basement buccaneers
like me, had to quit doing our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state spent a lot of years pretending
like the medical marijuana industry didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: exist and waiting for the feds to step in
and say it couldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that didn't happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sort of went around the state and
created a list of the things that most
[SPEAKER_00]: offended them and got together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of compared lists and the stuff
that went to the top of that list,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just obliterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign spinning is specifically explicitly
prohibited by anyone in the dispensary or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a sign spinner in front of your
place, like little Caesar's does,
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they should allow those because
those are the best signs of like low
[SPEAKER_01]: quality weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're spinning a fucking sign for a $5
gram, that tells me don't fucking shop
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's straight up what that means to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No advertising, no windows to the sales
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while they wanted to pass a rule
that the dispensary had to be negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: air pressured so that when the doors
opened, no stinky pot air would escape on
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be sucked into the building
through some sort of high end filtration
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because they didn't
understand that carbon filters are a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they didn't just say carbon
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking about it like it's a
fucking bio weapons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they think carbon filters make CO2
when they look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that first, I really think it was
2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado legitimately went from a thousand
retail locations to 500 within a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then after the vertical integration,
don't let me interrupt you, I apologize,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, vertical integration was a big piece
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 70-30 rule is only now finally fully
being dissolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the one hand, it's an incredibly
profitable business model if you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, it's a fucking
nightmare from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's like saying that 7-Eleven can
only sell 7-Eleven products, but now they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have Doritos and fucking Coke in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the, you need Doritos and Coke
in your 7-Eleven or it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the jacket store has to be good at
raising cows, like it just gets too
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking complicated.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I think the next thing that
really fucked everything up and made a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mom and pop, the bro style shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved them, those shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like you and me working there,
like walking like, what's up bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this fucking cush, you're going to
love it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got dreads and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it to you for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I missed those shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like, welcome to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to one place and they made me take
the fucking tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, I want, I want the,
the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see them on that shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well over here, we do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow me for the rest of the tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you're wasting my fucking
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about your tour, but the next
thing that I think ruined us was the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cameras and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good idea, but nobody could afford
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to upgrade your security
system in six months to have a camera on
[SPEAKER_01]: every square foot of your cultivation
retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I go here, you have to be able to
see me at two angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go here, two angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one dispensary owner that at that
point, they shut their, their marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: store down and opened up a security
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the smartest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally shift gear, shifted gears
to, well, this is dumb and way too
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't afford it, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can be the sales manager who sells
the other 12 business owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the cameras they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the smartest move he could
have made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, they immediately added the
first, one of the first things they did,
[SPEAKER_00]: they added regulations saying you had to
improve the property above and beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: building code and you had to beautify the
parking lot out of the sidewalk all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all of a sudden, instead of just
being able to find a retail location,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a deal with the landlord and say,
okay, now I've got a 3000 a month rent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, put together storefront by big
gun safe, you know, bolted the floor in
[SPEAKER_00]: the back and you know, buy a couple of
pounds of weed from a friend of yours who
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and open a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need $400,000 to improve the
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need another $200,000 to put in the
security system and the new wall they want
[SPEAKER_00]: between the safe and the what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the licensing, the licensing
became super ridiculously expensive for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those costs pushed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I put it is all the people that
had soul got pushed out by all the people
[SPEAKER_01]: with money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could watch there were
dispensaries in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go to, we would stand in fucking
line to get product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that every the second Friday of
every month, this one strain came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could buy seven grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there was another spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we would line up for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when all these new rules
happened, all those places fell off and we
[SPEAKER_01]: watched the quality decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: The availability is through the roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was never more herb, but I didn't
fucking want any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, they just turned all the shit
really quickly with all those rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of places they, I mean,
they specifically pushed, pushed out
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody without large capital behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had requirements like you had to
have, you know, five or six hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars in an escrow account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our city of Pueblo was going to pass that
rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I pointed out that we weren't
allowed access to banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, you were just insisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had a duffel bag with four.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to do 200,000 down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A duffel bag with 200,000 in it that we
just like, I guess, showed the inspector
[SPEAKER_00]: when they came by to check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the purpose of that money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's what is that sitting there
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Their original intent was if we got sued
for being a weed business, a weed
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the fucking phrase?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if somebody got sick from something
they got from you, you'd have to have some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an official legal term for running
a property where people consume drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm spacing the name drug den.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, yeah, it's a drug den.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a drug den law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was essentially an insurance fund
in case you got sued because, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, somebody bought something from your
store and then plowed into somebody on the
[SPEAKER_00]: way home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorite people down here in
city government fought really hard every
[SPEAKER_00]: time somebody brought up an insane rule
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, do we have this rule for
florists or the oil change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the shooting range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then why do we want to do it for pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the only answer she was given was
because it's pot, she would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, then fuck off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it should be treated
like if you don't treat it like a
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous drug, that's super fucking
druggy, then it's not a drug that's super
[SPEAKER_01]: druggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we treat it like alcohol and cigarettes
are widely accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I kind of think it's cool that
if you see somebody walking around with a
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette, people look at them like
they're a dipshit because they're slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: killing themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it that we look at them
condescendingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to enjoy a cigarette or a
beer, do your thing, have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't treat it like it's the devil and
it's some fucking crazy drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if cannabis was treated like that
on all levels, like politically,
[SPEAKER_01]: physically, what sort I'm looking for
financially, there's another economically,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the word I'm seeking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just treated it just like this
bottle of water, dude, I want one,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could buy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we don't treat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I made water illegal, now the people
might shoot me for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People might steal it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since there's so many of them here,
not at everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I went somewhere where there aren't
a lot of these, drop me off in the desert
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of some fucking third world
country where they don't have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a totally different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to shoot me for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to kill me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to dismember me and take it
from me because there isn't any there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because yeah, so you get the point,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that shit's legal, if it's just like
bananas, nobody gives a fuck about bananas
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't treat them like they're weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a million, million reasons why
cannabis should be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you look at it, the more insane
it seems that it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting there though, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many states are on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many countries are on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad because I didn't prep and
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like five more with the most recent one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're way off on a side tangent here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has nothing to do with edibles
anymore other than the fact that I'm high
[SPEAKER_01]: as fuck off some edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble and we're
glazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ross Dejeff and White Mike 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's only six or eight states
left that don't have some sort of quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis access law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either a medical program that basically
anyone can join if they want or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait till I could just drive from
Colorado out to California, pick up a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of friends and then drive out to
New York and we all have a fat bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: herb, our dabs, all of it with us and
nobody worries about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can travel some again, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while it was like, all right,
so weed's legal in Colorado and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state and I don't want to go to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's plenty of places with
legal herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our medical marijuana cards are good in
New Mexico now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So New Mexico is a reciprocal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go down and check out
Meowth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, I might just be happy
enough just to be able to go places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even care if we can smoke weed
places now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My introverted ass is going to be excited
to have plans when this shit is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the events that we should normally
be attending, this would be the couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: months where I would be preparing for the
next two or three large events that come
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're not coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel really weird for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be worn out from whatever dumb
Halloween event we just did.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get to wear my Chewbacca costume
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're polishing up on Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cancel all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of the reasons I was so
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, you're doing an edible
show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, I want in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't make time for this shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some more content out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people are in the same
boat I am where I just had to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: cancel Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to think about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get our family had the house to Jeff
get fucking let's get those two glazed and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit into a cast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our family had to cancel Thanksgiving
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had that a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all called and like, hey, we'll think
we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no, we expected that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, yeah, we bought
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody gets to go meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to send one person is going to
go around and pick them up and take them
[SPEAKER_01]: to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works out pretty well for our
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife likes to host.
[SPEAKER_00]: She loves to have people over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She loves to put plates of food in front
of people she loves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of her core personality
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last house we lived in before this
was a great home, but it was not a home
[SPEAKER_00]: where you could host people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just not designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a dining room space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have a table space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when we had a four year old
and a one year old, it was just no fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless we want to sit on the floor all
crisscross style with our plates in our
[SPEAKER_00]: laps, we can't have more than four people
over once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we found this place,
that was like her main criteria for house
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's Thanksgiving going to be like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this year to be like, no,
we're going to cancel shit all summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been staring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, nope, it'll be over by
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she came to me on her own and was
like, we should cancel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super proud of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also like super heartbroken for her
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get a bunch of cardboard cutouts,
bro, like all the sports are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's got a local family scheduled
to come by and get a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just going to have go plates ready
at the end of the driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That still feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get turkey sandwiches, so I'm happy as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy holiday time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not be ripping this pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are dangerous people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to eat more of that edible
because it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could see how heavy my eyes have
gotten through this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the bright lights, but I didn't have
to talk into the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the new camera, but talking to it
feels, I'm just talking to the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it feels really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to have somebody to ramble back
at me in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured out how I like to have the
cameras to be focused on the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be able to film myself,
because I'm so sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can pay attention to you and follow
the show rather than way over analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I'm broadcasting to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to even look at myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm distracting and I check on my eyes
occasionally because I feel they're heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mainly try to just look at you
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine what my fucking eyes
look like this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glazed as shit from those gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the glasses behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have a hat on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the dreads out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, but I feel like we're getting
off course here and super rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless you've got any more super wise
words of wisdom, let's wrap it up and let
[SPEAKER_01]: these fine people get back to their days,
get back to their lives, get back to
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever else they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get out of their ears for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything left to say for these
kind folks that are listening and
[SPEAKER_01]: watching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit us up on social media, ask us
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one more time, how do they do that,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they find you on the social media?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me at Twitter at NemoPunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shadow banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to search that one a little bit
harder than you might otherwise have to
[SPEAKER_00]: because Facebook censors cannabis related
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone from the podcast, I never give
out my Instagram with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always find me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at NemoPunk15 on Instagram too.

but I'm going to need a snack and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll take some dabs and see how the night

[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you back on more episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My schedule is insane right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID with two kids in the house.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: My day starts at 7 AM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends at 10 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's energy left for anything,
it's pretty mind numbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way past 10 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap up
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I'm at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the energy of those boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had the energy of one of those
two boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm not on the podcast as
much as I want to be.
