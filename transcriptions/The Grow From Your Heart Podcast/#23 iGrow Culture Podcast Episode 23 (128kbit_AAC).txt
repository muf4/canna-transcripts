this show possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate you guys for listening
and supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys might remember I ate a
350-milligram edible on an episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got a little bit of news that I
just found.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me scroll to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got it right here on this page.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to drop the music out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little distracting for me.

[SPEAKER_04]: T's SoundCloud page.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a fucking sweet shot of DJ Nika T
DJing at Red Rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you look stylish in that shot,
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for letting me play your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get down to this news article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: My voice is, of course, Raspi from Dabin.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's par for the course, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says, tougher rules on Colorado
marijuana edibles for serving size and
[SPEAKER_04]: child safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article is by Eric Gorski from the
Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, Colorado's recreational marijuana
edible manufacturers face tougher rules on
[SPEAKER_04]: potency, serving size, and packaging of
their products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under stopgap rules adopted by state
regulators Thursday, the new guidelines
[SPEAKER_04]: crafted in response to concerns about
overconsumption by inexperienced consumers
[SPEAKER_04]: will do away with bite-sized products that
pack in 100 milligrams of the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical THC, the maximum allowed by state
law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Products may contain up to 100 milligrams
of THC, but they must be easily broken off
[SPEAKER_04]: into pieces that have 10 milligrams or
fewer, the standardized edible serving
[SPEAKER_04]: size under state law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we've standardized, apparently,
10 milligrams as a serving of edible
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you buy a 100 milligram bar,
they want it easily divisible in 10
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't say names of products,
but you know how a KitKat is already kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of separated into servings?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of how I see they could do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sorry, KitKat, that I used you,
but your serving shit is perfect for my
[SPEAKER_04]: example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Hershey's bar has got, they're already
divided perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what they're going to require of
all of these pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to say that that edible that I
ate on the show, was 350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was small.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to measure it in my head to
have something to compare it to,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was quite tiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I don't have anything in my range
that is about the same size.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about the size of the top of a pill
bottle cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that cap on your pill bottle was
about that big, like an inch and a half by
[SPEAKER_04]: an inch and a half, and it was slightly
thick.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing was, there was no way to
judge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could break it in half, I guess,
and kind of eyeball it, but there was no
[SPEAKER_04]: way to really judge the size of that sort
of an edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to make it to where they
have to be easily broken up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that way you eat 10 milligrams
instead of trying to guess instead of
[SPEAKER_04]: getting wrecked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, in another change,
manufacturers will be required to put
[SPEAKER_04]: single serving edibles and child resistant
packaging before shipping them to stores
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of relying on stores to provide
the packaging as customers leave with
[SPEAKER_04]: their purchases.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that means more costs also.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to go up because the
manufacturer now has to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's just going to get moved
right on down the line to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to get pushed right on
down the line to you because now you're
[SPEAKER_04]: able to bring in, they give you this big
white, it looks like a money envelope,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of like a bank bag, but it's got a
child resistant zipper thing on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got like a clasp on the zipper that
you have to know how to open.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you bring that, you can put all of
your edibles and stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they let that count as your childproof
container.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually, you can buy those or
they charge you for them at a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're just going to go put that right
on the product already.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to pay a little more,
but I guess a couple of bucks to keep kids
[SPEAKER_04]: safe is what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get into the argument of what
about parenting?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a, it's not all about the
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the parenting, but that's
another argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably a whole nother podcast that talks
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the rules, this one says the rules,
which still must be made permanent in a
[SPEAKER_04]: process that will include public comment
will go into effect in November 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grew out of meetings with health
officials, regulators, industry
[SPEAKER_04]: representatives, and activists on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: The marijuana enforcement division's
primary concern is to ensure public
[SPEAKER_04]: safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrice Bryant, a spokeswoman for the
department of revenue wrote in an email,
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana enforcement division feels that
clear serving size requirements within the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry is a vital part of responsible
regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel O'Brien, a founding member of smart
Colorado, which supports tighter
[SPEAKER_04]: restrictions on marijuana said the rules
are a step in the right direction,
[SPEAKER_04]: but time will tell whether they go far
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Edibles manufacturers responding to public
demand already shifted to lower potency
[SPEAKER_04]: edibles since recreational sales began
January 1st, said Mike Elliott,
[SPEAKER_04]: executive director of the marijuana
industry group.
[SPEAKER_04]: The free market has largely addressed this
problem, he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I kind of agree that 350 milligram
edible that I, it fucked me up and I'm a
[SPEAKER_04]: professional pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take dabs all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wake and bake on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not bragging about how much
I smoke or anything, but I, I get down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm smoking live resin right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably took a couple of half gram dabs
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that edible wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if somebody, if a normal civilian got a
hold of that thing and ate the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, they'd be destroyed and they would
have a miserable experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think clearly marking it is key.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all remember the story of the lady from
New York, Marino Dowd, that ate too much
[SPEAKER_04]: edibles and thought she was fucking
turning herself inside out and dying in
[SPEAKER_04]: her hotel room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well guys, I think that's enough news for
the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of wanted to read you that one
article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse came over.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a little outdoor grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like my voice is about to blow out
anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to turn up the music and then
we'll be back with the grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on for just one second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you got a dabber, if you got a
joint, if you got a bowl, if you got an
[SPEAKER_04]: edible, if you've got a drinkable,
if you've got some topical, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: consume that at this time, cause I'm going
to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means that kind of technically we
are getting high together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when this music starts count to about
30, and that means we're getting high
[SPEAKER_04]: together right about then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright guys, you got the nail hot,
you got your bowl packed, you got a joint
[SPEAKER_04]: rolled, you got something going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get stoned together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking a dab of some Girl Scout
Cookies live resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made by a close friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hit a Hitman mini cake with a
highly educated, it's the Infiniti nail
[SPEAKER_04]: hooked up to an E nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the old temp temple because at one
point I had arranged a sponsorship deal or
[SPEAKER_04]: something with the temp temple,
but they've since sold the company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got the temp temple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's set at 460.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just about right, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've also got a highly educated
titanium carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to drop the dab onto the nail
and then pop the carb cap on to get high
[SPEAKER_04]: with me guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be right back in just a
second with Jesse's outdoor grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, what's up ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I've got Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we do that, man, I want to say
congratulations on the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse just got married.
[SPEAKER_04]: His wedding was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you've heard his talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome to the show and
congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like a new man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your hair is halfway combed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a big old smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a haircut, groomed the beard a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't going to mention the grooming of
the beard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have to get refitted for your
dress after they groomed your beard?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because it still stayed in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: His beard is manly as fuck, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he'll let me post a picture of him,
we'll put a picture up on the Instagram or
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere so you guys can see what a man
beard looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado man beard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn myself up a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not loud enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, it's an ego thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to come up more on the computer
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jesse is a part of the Hygro store.
[SPEAKER_04]: His wife works there.
[SPEAKER_04]: How involved are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you an employee or are you just kind
of helping behind the scenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am helping behind the scenes,
helping with training employees on product
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also doing commercial sales for
dispensaries, caregiver grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll beat anyone's price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ego thing, speaking of egos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pushing the mic closer to his face.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys can hear him a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll turn me down and him up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll make this happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So speaking of Hygro, a couple of people
that have been listening to the podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of called us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said 550 bucks for a tote of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I go online, that's only $299.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did some research.
[SPEAKER_04]: The caveat is if you pay $299,
shipping is $249 because it's got to be
[SPEAKER_04]: shipped on a FedEx truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just talking about how big a tote
of soil is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the size of a Volkswagen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably three and a half,
four feet wide by three and a half to four
[SPEAKER_04]: feet tall, depending on how much it's been
compressed, because it is going to be kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of squished down by gravity and being
moved around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do they get that off the truck when
they bring it to your house?
[SPEAKER_00]: With a pallet jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right to your front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Know where it's going to go when they get
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can sweet talk the guy into
getting it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This show is brought to you by Hygro
Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you check out Hygro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure I already said that once
in the show, but I like giving them love
[SPEAKER_04]: because they give us a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to give us a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should review a little bit of what
we've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: By now, we should have some big ass bushes
that are in the veg stage, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked a little bit about feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about top dressing a little
tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have them kind of... Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about to start the bloom phase and
the stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we want to top them and do some
training, now is kind of our last chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should stop topping by now,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless we've got plants that are going to
clear the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless height's a concern and that's your
motivation for topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, by all means, do what you
need to do to get your crop in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want the neighbors seeing that
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want the people walking down the
street to see that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have to do it, we can pull
the plants down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have been taking care of it,
you should be able to grab some branches,
[SPEAKER_04]: the tall ones, and just pull them down and
then maybe tie them to a stake or maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: tie them to something in the garden that's
already there, like a rock or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use a stake in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use big bamboo poles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just spread that plant out to where
instead of growing straight up,
[SPEAKER_04]: you kind of got it growing a little
horizontally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now's your time to get it going because I
think within the next 10 days here,
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone's going to go into flower real
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a strain that's a Tom Hills deep
chunk crossed with a G13.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I fixed that noise, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fixed all that noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just noticed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a strain that's got some kind of
land-raised stuff in it and it has started
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually snuck up on me and I had to take
clones that are kind of pre-flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, that's one thing we're going to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got some outdoor plants and
you're waiting for them to go in flower
[SPEAKER_04]: and you need some clones from them so you
can grow next year, get clones now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say, and I'm going to go off on a
little side rant here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I warned Jesse there'd be a rant about
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're growing from seed or a clone
that is brand new to you, take some clones
[SPEAKER_04]: before you go into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really frustrating when you grow a
plant and it's done and you smoke it with
[SPEAKER_04]: some of your friends and they're like,
what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, it's the best and you all
agree and they go, I can't wait till you
[SPEAKER_04]: grow it even better next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you go, oh yeah, I don't have a clone
of that so we're never going to get to
[SPEAKER_04]: taste this ever again except this one
round.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the most frustrating, heartbreaking
feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take clones, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely take clones from everything
that you grow if you've got the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some killer advice from a seed
company owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I'd want you to buy more
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But what if you find that keeper?
[SPEAKER_04]: How about when you do get that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Harvest heavy, it tastes dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: It fucking gets you high as hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to wish you had a clone of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you had a clone of it too because I
want to cut when I find you at the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cup or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a clone of that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So get some clones all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you mentioned the seed company
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sound advice right there if I'm a
seed guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're talking about getting those
plants below the fence line.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do the low stress technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do a little bit of super cropping
like Soma does, kind of crack them and
[SPEAKER_04]: bend them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now's your last chance really because
you're going into flower in about 10 days
[SPEAKER_04]: and I really don't like to mess with
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are hormones in your plants,
oxens and cytokinins that move around
[SPEAKER_04]: with, they find the tops of the plants and
affect the top of the plant and the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that stuff grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to disrupt that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll freak your plants out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mess up bud sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you can still kind of pull them
down and low stress training them,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you don't want to go and kick their
ass real bad or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had one of my first seasons growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't top and all the plants were from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the Mary stem, you know,
it was just, or the main stock was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just as straight as could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tied a rope around the top of the,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep on ducking and weaving on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep doing it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse brought over some live resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you got to like the live resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unicorn hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: The unicorn hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ones you did from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tied the rope around the top of the plant
and just pulled the whole fricking thing
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost made like a bow and arrow looking
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result was just like this whole
head road of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the side branches took over and
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all went up as lateral tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the hormones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis wants, cannabis wants one
dominant top on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I know what it is, but I'm not
going to, we'll go, I'm trying to go
[SPEAKER_04]: slowly with the listeners and get
everybody up to speed and not try to add
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosenthal people.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you talk to him, he forgets that
we're not all doctors and rocket
[SPEAKER_04]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed scientists and he'll just blow
your mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to go slow for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about the oxens and cytokinins
and the other hormones and plants that
[SPEAKER_04]: make them want to grow a top bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you cut out that top bud,
all the other bottom buds go, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when you kill the, you kill the
leader, all the, all the little tribesmen
[SPEAKER_04]: think that they could be the leader.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what the top, the bottom
buds do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you got that plant, pull it over,
like a fishing pole would bend when he got
[SPEAKER_04]: a fish, uh, all those little branches that
you've got, those little sucker buds that
[SPEAKER_04]: oftentimes we cut off, those will create
nice little bud sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause now they're, they've got the chance
to become a top and they're also exposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real neat effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should be in the stretch phase or
starting to pre flower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you doing anything for bugs now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I spray with neem oil, um,
and I just did it the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as soon as I noticed flower,
uh, I, I really don't, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I really don't like spraying the plant
with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, I stop, uh, the kelp mills,
compost tea sprays, um, and the neem oil
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do that individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, just stop the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole garden as each strain starts
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, can't spray that plant
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, um, so, um, in Southern
Colorado, we're getting a lot of rain
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and there's some weird bugs
popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, little flying critters I've
never seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff's going to be out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I personally haven't noticed,
um, any, uh, you know, them being a
[SPEAKER_00]: predator plant predators, but,
um, it could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those things are going to look for
homes and they're going to lay eggs
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're normal homes for laying
eggs are going to be disrupted and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to have to go look under your
leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now if you find some shit,
put on some gloves and just clean them out
[SPEAKER_04]: of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just clean that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to get, if you're a hippie,
you want to give those bugs a new home,
[SPEAKER_04]: feel free to re relocate them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck those bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw them in the fucking burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were me, I'll feed them to the
chickens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I bet your chickens would love you for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you dealing with all the rain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it has been raining every day from
about six o'clock to nine o'clock for the
[SPEAKER_04]: past week until today when it was fucking
sweltering hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I keep my plants hollowed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the foliage on the inside,
um, uh, there isn't really any,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, even in veg, I do that, um,
especially as it gets later in veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, and you guys will learn what
I cut up your plants a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the biggest thing the rain has been
doing to me is, uh, saving me from having
[SPEAKER_00]: to water my plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, my main outdoor garden's in a
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, a couple of acres drain into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, works out real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of water for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have yet to be out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, hand to hand, we need to go on a
short little road trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought my dad his, uh, first,
uh, dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to meet your dad at the wedding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, I, I thought that was who he was.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't introduce himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just walked up, shook my hand,
nodded at me and gave me the, like a man
[SPEAKER_04]: handshake and a man nod, like you're
welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he walked away and he didn't speak
because it was so loud at the,
[SPEAKER_04]: where we were.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't have heard him if he did speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, that's probably pops right
there, but I'm not certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, uh, he beams this energy of you
fucking respect me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just what comes off of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do respect me and I don't want to know
what will happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I don't, because I have no intention,
but, uh, he just looks like a man that
[SPEAKER_04]: commands a little bit of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His younger days.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, um, um, I've seen him do some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No mortal man can't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I watched him do immortal shit,
uh, dabbed and out drank everybody at the
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking table where he was and then stood
up and called us youngsters pussies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we couldn't keep up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys going to dab or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like shit, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm falling out of my chair, dabbed out
over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I could use a dab then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had fun though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had fun with your, your whole family was
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your wedding will be talked about not only
on this podcast, but in Colorado for years
[SPEAKER_04]: to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was shooting for with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first dab bar in a Colorado wedding
that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day after the wedding, I saw,
um, I still haven't gotten to read it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Washington poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New York times had an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: About, uh, marijuana being a welcome guest
at a Colorado and Washington, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: weddings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, damn, we're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there were usually at weddings,
uh, and this is just a cliche thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's usually one fight and it's usually
like a sisterly thing or some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, I can't believe you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it just gets fucking stupid and
it's a drunk family member.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually almost did, but I derailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, no, that's, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was very chill and laid back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good job to everybody for getting home
safely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched everybody at the end of the
night, uh, search for rides and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that were sober were kind enough to
get all you silly drunk fuckers home.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We party hardy, but, uh, we did,
you know, try to be safe as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well driving from there, you had to be
safe everywhere as you came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, we're talking about a
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, do you guys know what you're looking
for when you're going into flower?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking for your males?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking for your females?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're growing outdoors near us,
I really hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you know, unless it's on purpose
and then right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So quickly, if you're looking for females,
uh, it looks like they're growing a cotton
[SPEAKER_04]: ball when they start to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like you're getting a dandelion
when they're making flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got, uh, some balls and
literally it looks like you're growing a
[SPEAKER_04]: little, little pack of bananas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start green.
[SPEAKER_04]: They start green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they turn into balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kill those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're looking to make seeds and
piss off all your neighbors that grow weed
[SPEAKER_04]: and seed up all their crops, kill those
male plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, or yeah, just kill them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have clones, uh, call me,
we'll see what kind of males you got and
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe we'll do something fun with those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you're looking for the,
you want the dandelion looking ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the easiest way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, we got to do, you guys got to
read some books.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you aren't familiar with males and
females, you got to catch up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: do a little bit of reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what a grower needs to
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be doing so identify the males,
pull the males and even feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminizing is not a 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: We say 99%, which, uh, still there's
problems happen when you're making,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you use certain methods, you're less
likely to get FEMS.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you use certain methods,
then FEMS occur often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it at a, a big dispensary girl
grew out of like 250 feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had like four males.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't pay attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all got wrecked and the owner was quite
pissed and you know, it was explained to
[SPEAKER_00]: him, you know, 99% do the math,
250 plants.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now he's got a problem with feminize
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to push that right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to, I want to make sure that
people hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensary owners, uh, in general don't
like growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that do, uh, mad props to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, man, you get such great shit when you
grow them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know what you're going to find
and you don't have the clone that
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody in your neighborhoods growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody around here right now has a damn
blue dream clone flow flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I give out flow to new growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're like, I'm new and I need to
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, try this flow cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually I think that's flow to cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really think that cut we have is
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always saw the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard that story.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's somebody in Colorado that posted
on Facebook that they know that that's
[SPEAKER_04]: flow to cut and that they actually got
that cut from Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're listening to this show,
please tweet me or Facebook me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you can go to Irene genetics or I grow
culture on Facebook or Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I want to know more about the cut of
flow that goes around Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's a cut called tangerine that is
not tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the tange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's so confusing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is flow and urban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody in Colorado knows what I'm
talking about, it's not tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone calls it tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they called it the tange tange or the
Tang Tang for a little while around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure that's flow and urban
poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tang Tang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a big, uh, full, full spread,
uh, um, dispensary ad about that string
[SPEAKER_00]: way back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody near the Fort Collins area made
that one really is from what I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of, that's the problem with
the weed world because by the time I give
[SPEAKER_04]: you a clone, the story has changed and
then you give it to somebody else and the
[SPEAKER_04]: story has totally changed and then they
pass it on and now it's not even the same
[SPEAKER_04]: strain and it's being hoarded or it's
being hoarded out for way too much money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not being grown to its potential
because it's not being called what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patients are getting jacked.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in the stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're blooming.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting off track here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's cool though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem to like, uh, the listeners have
responded, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like it when I get all high and just
talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like it when I kind of go off course,
cause I ate a big ass edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh guys, I'm so glad with that edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate, uh, I gotta tell you, I felt like
shit for the whole next day though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, eating that whole edible really,
uh, took a toll on my body.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm getting old as part of what I'm
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 35 now and I think when I was 25,
I probably could have done it and not felt
[SPEAKER_04]: like shit the next day, but I had to go
get some kombucha and fucking eat a big
[SPEAKER_04]: fat meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to try to put myself back on track,
but no disrespect to that edible company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not supposed to eat all of it at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I listened to that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't, yeah, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't even supposed to eat half of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they make the stuff so good though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was delicious too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that was just like a restaurant dinner
or a restaurant dessert, I'd order that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need that peanut butter thing you serve,
put some ice cream with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since we're going into flour,
we're starting to stretch a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking for the males.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if it's questionable, if it's weird,
keep a really good eye on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower inner branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a good spot to, look for
hermies where you don't get as much light
[SPEAKER_00]: straight on the top to top lead buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common area too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, get those out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The males and the herms, get them out of
there, put them in the fire pit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it gets to be careful when you're
throwing away your trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you live in a non-legal state,
that's something that I just want to throw
[SPEAKER_00]: out there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just compost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost it if you can feed it to your
chickens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of us have a farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us are city folk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another, uh, there's another
podcast where one of the guys has
[SPEAKER_00]: chickens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I shout those guys out so we could say
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, shout out to crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Word.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up homie?
[SPEAKER_04]: What up bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: He cooked me dinner one time indirectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at an event or at a party where he
was the chef and he made dinner for
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody and props, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually asked me about my dietary
needs cause he saw that I got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knew I was a Rasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rastas have strict dietary restrictions
and he was respectful to that and made a
[SPEAKER_04]: meal around what I can and cannot eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do that when I barbecue with
vegetarian friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you invited me and you assured me
that there would be vegetarian friendly
[SPEAKER_04]: food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guys respect your vegetarian friends
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make fun of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear people make, yeah, dude,
that is so stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: We make fun of you back when you do it
because good because they deserve it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're telling me I'm stupid for not
eating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get even in our own ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I don't even know any good vegetarian
jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you call a vegetarian with
diarrhea?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a classic one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only one I got for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's feed our ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we're going into bloom so we can
slowly decrease the nitrogen and increase
[SPEAKER_04]: the phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you're top dressing, you can switch
your teas to the more phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_04]: potassium based teas for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're using the like granulated
products that they sell in the store,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can go ahead and switch to the bloom
version of those products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you don't have to keep using that veg
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, slowly switch that stuff though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, still, well, I don't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, assuming you've only applied it one or
two times, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it makes it look, just make sure you
have nitrogen because a lot of time those,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, products are pretty low on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bloom side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe, well actually when I feed my
indoor plants, I don't switch the day that
[SPEAKER_04]: I put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't just say they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's cut out all the veg newts and go to
just my bloom schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of phase it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a two week period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also keep my metal halide lights in
for about 14 to 21 days to keep them short
[SPEAKER_04]: and stocky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you switch them,
you really see them, they stay low and the
[SPEAKER_04]: buds fatten up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just slowly, I like to phase out my veg
into my bloom feed is what I think I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out of that Mexican bat guano,
um, Epsom salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using that, um, it's a good time
to be a foliar, you know, one last foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexican or Jamaican bat guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you said a high PK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like, um, some companies have blended
guanos with, uh, different PK values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just you want to high PK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So any alfalfa meal with this feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, I mean, it's a great time to
go ahead and top dress some in,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, alfalfa mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's really accessible
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what else are you putting in your tea
right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Jamaican guano.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, molasses molasses all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some, uh, Rocky mountain earthworm,
uh, factory or some more poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the bomb stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, uh, I'm kind of stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't Rocky mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't remember the name of the
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you Google Rocky mountain worms,
you'll find what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my own, uh, where I've made my
own warm castings before and they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: look as good as his dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's all about what you feed those
worms for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's got a real cool setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check them out up in Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a free shout out to, yeah,
we do a lot of free shout outs for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good stuff though.
[SPEAKER_00]: People grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's community, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not all about business all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some Michael's, uh, you know,
there's several different brands of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, GT, great white shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Z.
[SPEAKER_04]: H.
[SPEAKER_04]: O.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're using botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, the orca stuff liquid,
um, that's half dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never tried that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always fear that liquids are going to
wreak havoc on the rest of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you don't know what preservative
there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the powders, you can sprinkle it
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Near the root zone and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see that it's on there and be happy
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The OGT is available at high grow Pueblo
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would recommend out of all
that you can, uh, I can see a difference
[SPEAKER_04]: when I feed my plants that within 24
hours, uh, the next light cycle,
[SPEAKER_04]: two light cycles later, I guess,
when they come on, they're praying,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're up.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are pointing straight up like,
yes, they can pray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love that should be their slogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a, oh, GT's the bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: A great white shark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is really good at getting rid of soil
based insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I've heard the grow Kashi does
same thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing some experiments with that
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, Jesse mentioned before we
recorded that he got some grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys aren't paying attention to the
grow Kashi, it's probiotics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, big love to the probiotic farmers
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up gauge green and all the guys
running the probiotic farmers Alliance
[SPEAKER_00]: gauge green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's key play.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I don't know if I should use
Mike's real name, but what's up Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, those guys are inspiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, people ask where I get a lot of my
inspiration and a lot of my ideas and
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, a lot of it currently comes from
gauge.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's who I'm on now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a time where it was all Soma of
course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know Soma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea what that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a friend of mine was like,
you remind me of Soma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I Googled it and I was like,
it could be my father shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then there was some racist say,
whoever told you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're both white and have dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was all about the vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more about the vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Soma talks about mimetics and I'm
really big on the mimetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we'll talk about more about that later,
that's the, it's like a, the vibes sub
[SPEAKER_00]: cool always gets me going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was into sub cool for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, not to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost interest when it got dramatic with
him and miss Jill on the weed nerd show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I fell off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I lost interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and then, uh, I've always been a big
fan of Jorge and Ed Rosenthal for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like reading that's always gets me
fired up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lately Gage green has been one of the best
reader.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a, I was a Cali connection fan boy
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty decent friends with swerve and
Adam ill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got it going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good seed company right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work hard, you get paid good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were kind enough to let us hang out
in their booth for four 20 at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: cup on four 20 at four 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone else is crowded and chaotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was sitting on a couch taking a dab
with Adam ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I was at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who had a couch anywhere was
chilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was a hot cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait for four 20 again this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear big things are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought two years ago was crowded,
but it was more chaotic two years ago for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that year when you couldn't walk
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That alley, that alley was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to the high times crew,
Danny Danko, Bobby black, Nico.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to miss a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there's a lot of you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Dan's guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to you guys for coming to
Colorado and doing a huge ass event.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys look like you're going fucking
crazy when you come here and do it running
[SPEAKER_04]: around all chaotic for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Danny Danko will take time to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked by and just kindly, I said free
weed, joking around the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he turned around and shook my hand and
talked to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was busy, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interrupted them right in the middle of
a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey, thanks for recording free
weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny, you haven't put out a podcast in
over a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Free weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to fill your gap, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to fill your gap for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to say that feeling Danny
Danko's gap.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a podcast called free weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hosted by Danny Danko and Mike
Hughes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a high times production.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sponsored by them in any way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have respect for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny Danko and the free weed podcast are
actually part of what inspired this show
[SPEAKER_04]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to do things my way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of combined a lot of my
favorite people's shows and do my own
[SPEAKER_04]: thing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have the I Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Mike Hughes too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How I mentioned, I made sure to say Mike
Hughes on that show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just making sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure he gets love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel bad for Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He contributes heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be free weed with Danny and
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Mr. Danny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll tag at Danny Danko in this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I follow Mike Hughes,
but we'll tag him also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if they can listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better hook me up with someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like a pack of raw papers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that'll work.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to give a shout out,
it's Rasta Jeff and Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I said your full name on the other
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotten to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really give a shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to keep my identity kind of
separate from the Irene genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would grow culture stuff, but everybody
knows it's Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: After the first cannabis cup, people took
pictures with me and they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: look, I'm getting high with Irene
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, they know who I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the fucking ridiculously tall white
guy with red box.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is game over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when we first met, you told me
something about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within like a few weeks,
you're like, ah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to keep it on the down low,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: After the cup, when I went and sub cool is
there with packs of seeds in his hand,
[SPEAKER_04]: like what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sub cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I don't have shit to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, he doesn't even live in this
state and just, yeah, changed my whole
[SPEAKER_04]: outlook on things.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked a little bit about outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you how to find your males,
your hermaphrodites, get those out of
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We told you to cut clones, make sure you
cut clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to grow some shit and then
be like, this is my best strain ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually grew a strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I even want to say the
name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin, if you're listening, it was that,
uh, that strain that you and pops loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't get it to root.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those clones would not take roots for the
life of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it got away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got another pack of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you got to stop topping, but you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super crop and train your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about what Jesse puts in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to, uh, he doesn't realize I'm
trying to fish out what he's putting in
[SPEAKER_04]: his tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he doesn't like to tell us.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't like to share all the info.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I slowly pry it out of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got molasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got guano.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Michael's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you using any sort of seek help right
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp doctor Neptune stuff for like a
couple cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's flower time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, blood meal, bone meal,
any of that stuff yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never put any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you don't like slaughterhouse
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never put it in a tee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but top dressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an issue with slaughterhouse
products, but I also have a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: a shit ton of slaughterhouse products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're a farmer and you understand you,
uh, you balance it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's nothing wrong with blood
mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like where I, well, I mean,
I guess the argument could be made that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest thing with commercial
blood mills, we don't know where it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, those, or at least that's my
big issue with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those cows are fed shit that I
probably highly disapprove of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and don't want to put into my
body.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of why I'm a vegetarian is cause the
way they treat cows, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no need to contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in general, I don't really
like eating beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I can't stand ground beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most disgusting things I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most questionable meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate when I'm working and in a hurry and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a farmer and a grower, are you bothered
by like fast food joints by seeing what
[SPEAKER_04]: people are eating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, process any kind of processed meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm just as guilty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I try hard when I get busy in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's just, it's hard to cook
and it's easy to drive through a drive
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but yeah, that's, that's why this
country is so fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we have cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a huge issue with all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We paid people will pay top dollar for
their booze, pay top dollar for their
[SPEAKER_04]: herb, but then spend 99 cents on a fucking
cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spend those bucks on yourself guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, cancer is expensive later in your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cook at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cook with friends, eat with friends,
eat with, you know, your wife,
[SPEAKER_00]: your girlfriend, your kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's just good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cook with friends for relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sound advice from Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: You learned some shit on accident today.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't think that was coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we've done 30 minutes, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got anything else you want to add to
the grow lesson before we kind of start
[SPEAKER_04]: wrapping it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a little de-vegging, um, go ahead and
pull up the bottoms of the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So clip off any, uh, shave their legs,
shave their legs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's make them sexy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that bottom stuff is going to be crap
and larf and it's going to kind of take
[SPEAKER_04]: away from the top of your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take that bottom, the little sucker
leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not making, and you can do this
all the way up to like three or four weeks
[SPEAKER_04]: into bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take off all that crap that is in the
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll know if it doesn't look like it's
going to be a bud worth trimming,
[SPEAKER_04]: take it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't need to be there and throw it
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just throw it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a lot of you guys cut your leaves
off, throw them in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reuse it in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been, oh, mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we'll throw up real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, mulching up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a little alfalfa, um, some old hay
that we had laying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, actually I think it was straw,
but, um, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the city folk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some compost, um, and, uh,
you know, just helps hold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's getting into the hot time of year
and normally, uh, we're monsoon season
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, apparently, but, um,
you know, this other people in other parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the country, you know, this mulching up
is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a great way to get rid of
all your green waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a big old cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're, if you're juicing, uh,
you could juice your cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't been spraying shit on them,
if you've put neem oil or some chemicals,
[SPEAKER_04]: do not juice them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're, uh, if your leaves are clean,
uh, go ahead and juice those and taste
[SPEAKER_04]: that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're mulching now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have taught us a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's going to move to the country
and abandon the city and all move out to
[SPEAKER_04]: the middle of nowhere and to start these
organic, small, not even large scale,
[SPEAKER_04]: just small scale organic ganja farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just do your part, grow your own
food, grow your own herb, get some
[SPEAKER_04]: chickens, make your own eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't need fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I really try not to eat eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like, it's just not, that just
seems funky to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't eat, but yeah, if I, it's kind of
where I'm headed.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had chickens, bro, we'd eat eggs
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go out and get two or three eggs from
the chickens and we'd do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, uh, your shirt you were in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, that yellow is like grocery
store yellow and the orange is like what
[SPEAKER_00]: my eggs look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's probably 10 times the
nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they have a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you, you just think eggs have flavor
too, until you have good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have a good farm, fresh eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have my chickens in the city too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have them at the farm
too, but I also have chickens in my
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have chickens over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have, uh, in Pueblo, you can have,
don't quote me on this, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: six or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no encroachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which means, you know, you can't build
it right next to your, your chicken pen
[SPEAKER_00]: right next to your fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's gotta be five feet from a
property line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no roosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they can't be a nuisance,
which, you know, it takes a while to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a nuisance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have one that I'm about ready to
kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe none of my neighbors have
called him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wakes me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you're next bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your name is dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicken noodle soup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, once again, bro, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll quit talking about the wedding on
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so much fun guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I talk about it so much
parties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So congratulations to your wife also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if she listens, but I hope
you do burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forced her to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's laughs at me for listening to myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, you got to remember what you
said.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't say anything silly on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting really good at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to more episodes
because you're starting to get
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think you come back about two
or three weeks when we start kicking into
[SPEAKER_04]: flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll give you a call soon as like,
I get some good buds set.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guys, we're going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, go check out high grow Denver.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is the website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go look at that while we, uh, take some
dabs and I'll be back to wrap up the show
[SPEAKER_04]: in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, thanks again for coming on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We look forward to having you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.
Everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, there's another
great girl lesson from Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give him a big shout out for
coming out and taking some time out from
[SPEAKER_04]: his garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a family.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's newly married.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, take some little effort to get
over here and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look forward to having you back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, coming up in a future episode,
I plan to have a little debate on,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, well, not a debate, but a discussion,
a friendly discussion on, uh, the classic
[SPEAKER_04]: question of clone versus seed and also
have a little subtopic of feminized versus
[SPEAKER_04]: regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people are opposed to
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clear up some myths, give some people some
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's red rat in the song there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn that up for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty good mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nika shout out for this brand new makes
the nicotine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just made it pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now the show is over.
