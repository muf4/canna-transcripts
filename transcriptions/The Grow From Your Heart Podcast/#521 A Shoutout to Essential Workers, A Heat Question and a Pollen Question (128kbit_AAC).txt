[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous dab of Stardog
Batter from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, it says the product contains
63.2% THC, and 74% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am having a hard time keeping my eyes
open wide enough to read the label because
[SPEAKER_00]: the dab I just took was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna crack open the jar and give it a
fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always been a big fan of Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: This batter came out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I notice is when I crack
it open, it is a beautiful golden yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a nice piece of golden
yellow cheesecake batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beautiful batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this aroma hits me in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a spicy watermelon, gassy
strawberry sort of a thing that punches me
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took a dab of it, and it made me
stoned as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting down in the chair real mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of hunched over, and my eyes are
definitely squinty and bright red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am impressed and heavily medicated
off of the Stardog Batter from our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of my friends over
there at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm doing shout outs, let's send a
shout out to everyone who is working for
[SPEAKER_00]: or at a dispensary right now in the state
of Colorado, and I think in most states
[SPEAKER_00]: which offer medical and or recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical and rec cannabis have been deemed
essential businesses during this
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine during the lockdown time of the
COVID-19 virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all of my friends
working in the industry, risking their
[SPEAKER_00]: health, risking their lives to be out
there to keep us supplied with medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to everybody who is
working to keep the world moving while
[SPEAKER_00]: most of us are hiding in our safe homes to
keep ourselves safe and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're out there working your ass
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wearing extra personal protective
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably wearing a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably scared shitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have to come home and do
extra shit at the end of the day just to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure not to contaminate your friends,
your family, your home, probably your
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what kind of environment you're
coming home to, potentially bringing home
[SPEAKER_00]: danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of extra steps that people
have to take today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not going unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By me, I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's hard to deal with some shit
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking extra precautions,
if you have to go to work, if you work in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grocery stores, the dispensaries,
the post office, if you're delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: things right now, if you're, I got a
grocery delivery today and it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grocery shopper did a damn good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those people that are doing those
types of jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just told you I took a giant dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing something out there,
putting yourself at risk, and I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mention you, I include you in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are keeping the world moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of you, if you don't have to go
out there, keep your ass at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to minimize social activity,
social interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's minimize the movement and spread of
this virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully soon we can all get back to our
normal activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only way I feel that that is going
to work is if we just stop spreading it or
[SPEAKER_00]: we all have to get it and just get it as a
normal virus, a normal thing that our
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies adapt to, which will probably have
a huge outcome that'll have a,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the word I'm looking for,
an aftermath of fallout as the word I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather everybody go inside and
stop volleying this virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough ranting about this virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've all heard enough about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody who's putting
themselves at risk out there, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the medical professionals who are
working extra shifts, who are having to
[SPEAKER_00]: witness and deal with all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do notice it and I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one positive thing I have noticed
during this quarantine or this lockdown
[SPEAKER_00]: period, this isolation time, whatever you
want to call it, what I have noticed is
[SPEAKER_00]: that many content creators, podcasters,
YouTube video makers, Instagramers,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many people have been making so much
more great quality content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being cooped up has inspired people to put
out ideas that have probably been in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of their heads for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't had the time or the energy to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are cooped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't go to the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't go to the gym.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are freaking out without going to
the gym.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is many people's biggest outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We close those immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many great YouTube and
Instagram videos and Instagram lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many musicians and other artists are
going live and doing their craft live so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can participate and watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a great thing to see in
this sort of a lockdown period.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the creative people, all of the
content creators, we are still creating
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've still got all this creative energy
and it's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be cooped up and you're
going to see our energy come out in
[SPEAKER_00]: different creative ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be one of the silver
linings to this weirdness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just try to find the positive that's
one great thing that I have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great artists are putting out
things online, doing things interactively
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can participate and they can
still get their craft and their art out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the people who are stuck at home,
now we've got some kind of a release.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't go to concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to have people giving us
some sort of stress relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's already six minutes into
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm SuperRambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into the part of the podcast
where we do some shout outs to the folks
[SPEAKER_00]: who support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody on today's episode is going to
get a germ free, a COVID-19 free virtual
[SPEAKER_00]: high five or a virtual hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with a virtual social
distance acceptable hug for my friend Miss
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a social
distance acceptable virtual high five to
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy Prospect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a digital dab over to my buddy
Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's roll up a big fat joint of digital
dank bud for my buddy Victor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we pack up the virtual vaporizer
for my buddy Willie's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we roll up a big JPEG joint for
my buddy Fat Rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big digital bong load over to
my buddy Tyler R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also pack up a big virtual blunt for
my buddy Woodside195.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we get some digital rosin dabs
going for my buddy Kana Organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
let's get a social distance acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: bong rip loaded up for my buddy Cosmo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody for all of the
support on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not supporting the show and you
would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes for my stoned friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
this is the part of the show where I read
[SPEAKER_00]: emails from my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a cannabis culture or
cultivation question, I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email on today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, I appreciate what
you've been telling your listeners about
[SPEAKER_00]: being safe with the CV-19 virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serious respiratory infections are
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I contracted H1N1 11 years ago and I
thought I would die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was off work for a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am being particularly cautious since I
am now a senior and in the danger zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have been trying to warn my
audience to take this very seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are taking it as a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are not taking the appropriate
precautions and they're putting other
[SPEAKER_00]: people at danger such as yourself,
somebody who's already suffered a major
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory disease, somebody who's
already faced death, and now somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: is a senior who is in the danger zone and
is well aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has got to be scary to look outside
and see dipshits running around,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting you in danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That must put fear in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something very interesting I
took in this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize I had a large senior
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten several messages recently from
people telling me that they're older than
[SPEAKER_00]: me or that they're seniors and they
appreciate the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great knowing that I am helping out
a broader audience, a more broad audience
[SPEAKER_00]: than which I realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you for adding that little
detail into there that does help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot more to the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am attaching some photos of my
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our friend here is growing golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I picked golden goat because I
live in Topeka.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've listened to the story of
golden goat, golden goat came from Topeka
[SPEAKER_00]: from a guy named Mr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm glad you're growing the golden
goat there in Topeka.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talks a little bit about the photos
they sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to discuss too much of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, we're planning a vacation to
the Buena Vista area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure that vacation may get
delayed or adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be able to meet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do ask if we can hang out during that
trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if things come together, we may be
able to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not make any arrangements that far
with all this chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, in case you were
looking for show topics, I am wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: about budget growing in a hot room.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I have a pretty good AC setup,
I can't add AC beyond the central air
[SPEAKER_00]: because the window unit will light leak
and the freestanding AC may be beyond my
[SPEAKER_00]: budget this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap up the email with, we'll keep up
the good work and an update on your Mac
[SPEAKER_00]: project would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they wrap up the email with,
used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend, used to be
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name pop up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize you were a senior and I
definitely did not know you survived the
[SPEAKER_00]: H1N1 virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you made it through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that somebody out there
appreciated my episode on the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of messages telling me to
stop spreading fear and hype and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to ignore it because I knew that I
could stand behind the episode that I put
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you for the support and the
feedback on that part of the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's move on to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a grow space and it's getting
too hot and you cannot add a window air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner because it will possibly give
you light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I find they are very good
opportunities for a thief.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do, push or pull that air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got an open window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on in, get what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an in, you've got an out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens way too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those air conditioners are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first recommendation was going to be
one of the portable air conditioners that
[SPEAKER_00]: has the hoses for an in and an out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not super efficient on
electricity and they are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says in here, a freestanding AC may
be out of my budget this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we do not have the option to create
cooler air, the only option is to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: that hotter air and hopefully replace it
with cooler ambient air from your main air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't help to add more fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't help to just blow that heat
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to actually need to remove
the heat or add colder air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we can do both in one move.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend is getting a carbon
filter and a blower, either a four or a
[SPEAKER_00]: six inch inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hook up the carbon filter to where the air
is sucking through the filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: then through your inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would run ducting out of that grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that grow space is in a
closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's in a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it's located.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some way to get that air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a four or six inch hole in a
wall, in the ceiling, going up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: attic, going out of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to vent that air out of there
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move it as far as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run that ducting, possibly out of a
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do run it out of the house,
camouflage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover it in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it obvious for neighbors,
for thieves, for the guy who comes and
[SPEAKER_00]: checks the meters, the guy that checks the
gas meter, the water meter, the electric
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know who could end up in your
yard on the side of your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be smooth about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to duct this hot air out of
there somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've hung a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got ducting running to another spot
where we can dump this warm air.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we plug in that blower, it is going
to move a lot of air that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be air missing in your
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will need to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that air will replace itself by
coming in through the crack underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: your door and the gap in your door between
the door and the door jamb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that blower is pulling a lot of air,
you may hear a little bit of whistling
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a sign of a lot of airflow
and you are getting negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to suck the door in,
which is not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is also happening at that time is you
are sucking fresh air into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you were bringing cool air in
from the rest of the house, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: central air or whatever type of air
conditioning you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a whole lot of details on
this grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I don't know if this
is a closet, a bedroom, an attic,
[SPEAKER_00]: a basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be any type of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do know is that we can't add an air
conditioner, so we cannot cool the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means we have got to remove the hot
air and hopefully replace it with cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: air just by air displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my first approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next approach may be to turn down the
light or possibly replace the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get a smaller light and run a
lighter light in that room just for one
[SPEAKER_00]: season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, I adjust my entire grow
two times a year just based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, I cannot run the same type
of setup, which I run in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are quickly approaching the time of
year where I have to start paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the weather every day to
think, oh, do I need to start making those
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once I make them, they're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go rebuild again and then
rebuild again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to pay attention to the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to reconsider hanging a
different light, maybe a smaller light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running an HID, maybe it's time
for an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running an LED, maybe it's time
for a smaller LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know what you've started
with, so I don't know what to adjust to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe run a smaller or if you've got
multiple, maybe it's time for less lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the modern lights have a switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just turn them down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will help cool the room for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe consider using a ducted light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're hanging ducts and a carbon
filter, the old ducted hoods, those work
[SPEAKER_00]: really well for keeping the room cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there are no real magic
tricks when it comes to cooling a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light creates heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That heat is going to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no trick to dissipating heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either have to get it out of there or
you have to fight it with an air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to battle the heat somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you have got to duct the
heat from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is not an option, maybe reduce the
amount of lights you are putting into that
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light is what is creating the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll reduce your overall heat problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they did wrap up the email with an
update on the Mac project would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make the Mac 2 Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the Mac female, the Mac 1 cut from
Capulater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated that with my Arise,
my King Solomon male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I did that, I did a very
small plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding my hands up to show you how
big it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how tall the plant was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant was maybe two feet tall at the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got hit with a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant made, I think it was five feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five or six seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made five that look good and one that
kind of looks like it might go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not tried to germinate those yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I did put a larger Mac plant in
the flowering room this time and I
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated it with the King Solomon again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically had that Mac plant leaning up
against the male plant as it started to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got the very first dumps of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got the early pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I probably had more success
this time, but I felt like the calyxes
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like they were seeded last time as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be deceiving me once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the best parts about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know how many seeds there are
until you cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start sorting it out and you realize I
pollinated right on time or I fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: and missed the pollination point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a real update on the Mac
to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make enough seeds to make it
worth my while last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple there to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look super healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look super viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't try to germinate them just so I
don't break my own heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still there at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are Schrodinger seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't cry over seeds that I don't know
about yet, but they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also attempted to make another batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do have a lot more, I will play with
them for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that I will let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see how they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I will give you an update
here on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set me off on a good rant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you again
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also hope you stay safe and healthy
and virus-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends out there who are young and
healthy who are not taking this seriously,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is one of the people who are at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not get my friend used to be cool
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need him around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cool fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into email number two for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Jeff, my name is Riley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Riley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm a medical patient
here in Illinois and I recently had a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant herm on me after it running too dry
while I was out of town for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, at least that's why I think
it hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it hermed on you because it
was too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was another issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get to that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I immediately cut this plant down
and checked for signs of pollination on my
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I was in the clear until
about one week later, I noticed my two
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla fucks were showing signs of
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cutting this crop down today and
starting over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted your advice on how I should
be sterilizing my grow to avoid future
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more I want to cover in the next
paragraph before I answer because this
[SPEAKER_00]: will contribute to part of the first
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since you immediately start talking
about light leaks and you also mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were opening and closing this
door during the day, I am going to assume
[SPEAKER_00]: that at least once or twice, you may have
fallen asleep or got too stoned or got too
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with your video games or whatever
it is you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not judging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blaming you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my stoner assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe once or twice, two or three times,
you probably forgot to close that door at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right time and they got a little bit
of light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light should have gone off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have gotten dark, but it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I'm going to suspect led to
your plants becoming hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, a plant that expresses
hermaphroditic traits under a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of stress like that, it was a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it was carrying intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you had to do is give it the
environment or give it the triggers to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you that that was in its genetic
code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is better off that you found out
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I assume it was from you leaving that
door open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not blame it on the plant getting
too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more likely from a light problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say if you need additional
info, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast as well as putting me onto
[SPEAKER_00]: embracing organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my friends, I am also on another show
called Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do Embracing Organics every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a live show that happens from 7 to 9
Mountain Time on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to YouTube, search for Embracing
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we are done with the show,
it stays on YouTube so you can see all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the old repeat episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply go to YouTube, search for Embracing
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I'm glad you're listening to
Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually on there tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I heard about you guys
on the dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends at the
Dude Grows and I've been going deep down
[SPEAKER_00]: that rabbit hole ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 100 episodes of Embracing
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a thousand episodes of the Dude
Grows show and there are 521 episodes of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have got a nice little rabbit hole
to dig down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy that, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're getting toward the end
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm looking forward to
getting my hands on some lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds after I recoup from this herm
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend getting FEM seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a med patient, I can only grow five
plants above six inches tall, so it is
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love from your buddy Riley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riley, the answer to the lemon Jeffrey
question is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only available in feminized seeds,
so I do recommend lemon Jeffrey feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part where you say you can only
grow five at a time so a pheno hunt is
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult, why not grow five?
[SPEAKER_00]: See which one is your favorite out of
those five, cut down the other four,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant four more seeds, grow those four,
see which is your favorite out of all five
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, cut down the other four,
repeat the process until you have got the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go through as many seeds as you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take as much time as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people are racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people are in a rush when it
comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the beautiful things about
cannabis, especially growing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it makes you take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke, you're supposed to slow
down and chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis is that feeling tenfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not get in so much of a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can break up your pheno hunt by
multiple rounds just to keep yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: within the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run five, pick your favorite,
repeat the process, and just keep picking
[SPEAKER_00]: your favorite one each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you pick the same one two or three
times in a row, and that's how you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to find a better keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you can make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move back up to the part where
you talk about pollination and herms and
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I remove this pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one very easy thing you can do to
get rid of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is deactivated by water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spray down the room with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a pump sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going at it, why not put some
bleach or maybe some Fizan 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe put some H2O2 or some Zero Tall
in there, and just spray down everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mist it really lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to ruin any electronics,
if you're not going to take down the gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: just mist it enough just to where
everything has a nice little layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do it two or three times,
and you will get rid of all the pollen in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely shot back all the corners,
sweep up real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can reach, hit it with a
broom, dust everything really nicely,
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe it all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water is going to kill and deactivate
any active pollen in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spray it down, get it wet, and the
pollen will be unviable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be basically dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another important thing to think about
is why did those plants herm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it genetics or was it environmental?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was from the dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume more, like I said earlier,
that it would be a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make sure we don't have any light
leaks in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think the lights are out in the
room, go in that room, turn off the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room, and stand in there,
and give yourself five solid minutes for
[SPEAKER_00]: your eyes to adjust and see if there are
any light leaks at all anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see any light, it is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need zero light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face, we have more light than what we need
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants to respond appropriately to
a dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got equipment in the room
that is lighting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a blue LED light on your MP3
player?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a blue light on some clock or
something in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a red light on something?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only acceptable light should be a
green light, and that is still
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make sure there are no light
leaks in that room so that we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: another herm problem in the future and we
end up sweeping up and cutting down plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing this whole panic move all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my short answer for a really long
answer is water is what kills pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is spray it down with
water, and those pollen grains hidden in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room will be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you dust everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some panda film on the floor
or if you've got a tray somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: move that tray, get underneath it,
flip those trays over, spray the bottoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: get everywhere because that pollen went in
places you would never imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very tiny microscopic dust flakes of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been blown around by the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's underneath shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the bottom sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you sweep up, get a shot back,
then spray everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe spray shit down a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also keep in mind that the only plants
that can receive pollen are the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in flower and have pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have got until you get more
flowering plants in there to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to apply a pesticide to
that room, if you put veg plants in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to hit them with a pesticide,
just go crazy with the fucking pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the whole room wet all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can be sure that you're
actively destroying any pollen that may
[SPEAKER_00]: have been left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Riley, I want to thank you
again for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
