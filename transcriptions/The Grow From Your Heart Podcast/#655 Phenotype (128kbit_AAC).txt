[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is episode 655 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to focus on
the word phenotype and talk about what
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype means and talk a little bit
about phenotype selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that part of the show,
let's do a few shout outs to a few of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind folks who support the show on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big Grow From Your
Heart podcast thank you shout out to a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand new supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Mean Green, and then let's wrap up the
thank you and shout out portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast by sending a big thank you shout
out to my buddy OG Purple Thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and easy for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what else do we want to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to dwell on it too long,
but it has been super warm outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big respect shout out to
all of the folks growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing ganja outdoors,
if you're growing fruits and vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, big shout out, big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the hard work and
dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sweltering hot out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out there growing, if you're
doing construction out there, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: out there spinning a sign, if you're doing
anything where you have to be outside for
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a couple hours at a time,
big shout out, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is too crazy hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been on an outdoor farm looking
at some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been at a couple of greenhouses
doing some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't talk too much about that,
but I was out there and I thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been out here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm covered in sweat, getting kind of
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wind came by and I thought,
oh, that breeze is going to be beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That breeze came by and it just grabbed
all the moisture in my body and just left
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That breeze was not refreshing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the wind is hot out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all you outdoor workers
and growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I hope your indoor equipment is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that air conditioner kicking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you blowing breakers yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope things are working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a swamp cooler,
I hope you've got a dehumidifier and I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope you added another breaker because
you're going to start flipping breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hot out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did talk about, I have been quite busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going to greenhouses and outdoor
grows and doing some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some secret projects up my
sleeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to talk too much about that
stuff until I've got some progress to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some partners and some friends
doing some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all excited to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just not ready yet, but that is why
the MailChimp newsletter is late.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were part of the show, if you've
been listening and watching for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, maybe you've signed up for the
MailChimp newsletter on the website at
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetics.com monthly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put out a newsletter,
let you know about vendor updates,
[SPEAKER_00]: sales, coupon code, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not put out the MailChimp this
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are around the 13th of this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not put that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've simply been overwhelmed and there was
not a lot to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the MailChimp newsletter
last month, simply repeat that newsletter
[SPEAKER_00]: this month, except there are no coupon
codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make coupon codes this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: No sale for this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get back on the sales next month on
Etsy or some cool coupon codes to make up
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did not put out the MailChimp
newsletter this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not much to report and I was
overwhelmed with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter has graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: She turned 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent some time with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a cool couple of events in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this new secret project going on
and it is summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have been overloaded and it has been
super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put over 2,500 miles on my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're around the 12th or 13th of this
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing seems to be slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just letting you know why the
MailChimp letter did not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've been rambling long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an email here in front of me
about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually was talking on Instagram Live
about this just a couple of days ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this email popped up so it worked
out perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, can you do a shortish video
on what a pheno is and how to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about phenos a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a great way to start this is by
defining the word phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply went to Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typed in the word phenotype and it says
the set of observable characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: an individual resulting from the
interaction of its genotype with the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read it one more time because I did
stutter in the middle of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the set of observable
characteristics of an individual resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: from the interaction of its genotype with
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put that into terms that when we
actually talk about plants to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The set of observable characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are observable characteristics within
our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have leaf color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have plant shape, plant structure,
branchiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they short?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they squatty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they bushy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they really sparse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they super stretchy?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are observable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are observable characteristics of an
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The individual being the plants we are
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all individual observable
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mouthful to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for a couple of stumbles,
but we will get through this, I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observable characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odors, aromas, those are observable
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz is an observable characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to finish the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to smoke it to determine and
discover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the high you get is a characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavors and aromas, those are all
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it respond to things?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something we can observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take two plants and I pop into a
twist this one and pop into a twist this
[SPEAKER_00]: one, they may react differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an observable characteristic of
that individual resulting from the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction of its genotype with the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about the interaction of
its genotype with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big part right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observable characteristics that result
from the interaction of its genotype with
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next move is to go define the
word genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does genotype mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Genotype is the genetic constitution of an
individual organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the ingredients of the organism,
the plant, the ingredients of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this were going to be a cake,
these would be the cake ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotype is what happens when we bake
this cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we burn it or do we cook it just right
or do we freeze it?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are interactions of the genotype
with its environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment is the grow room in which
we are putting it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got certain genes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to express differently in
different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I took the same plant, if I took 10
clones of the same plant, all healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, I rooted them all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all equal in all ways and I gave
them to 10 different growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see 10, not completely
different grows, but we're going to see 10
[SPEAKER_00]: different outcomes from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to be stickier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to be sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be more airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to see very typical
differences from different grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the phenotypical expression,
which is the characteristics of an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual resulting from its interaction
of its genotype with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can shorten that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say, this is what the plant is
expressing because of its environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular plant does these
particular things in this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know that some of my plants
really like it when it gets super cool or
[SPEAKER_00]: super hot or super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start learning
characteristics because you start
[SPEAKER_00]: observing those characteristics of an
individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you start learning how to make it
express certain things or stop it from
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that if we want plants to turn
purple toward the end, we can make them
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a phenotypical expression directly
related to, it's an interaction to
[SPEAKER_00]: response from the environmental factor we
put on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made it cold and it said, it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all plants will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take a pack of seeds and grow 10
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some females, some of the plants,
some of the males and females,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the plants out of there may turn
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may not turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are specific phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype is the expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to say it's the
expression of those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the cake goes into the oven,
it is how it is baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you put it in too hot of an oven to
burn it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you put it in an oven just right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were it baked perfectly?
[SPEAKER_00]: These phenotypes are going to show you
what they want from your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your room dialed in most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got pretty good guidelines of
temperature, humidity, light cycles that
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted at, but then your plants are
going to tell you based on phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, what is perfect for that plant
for that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is dialing it in for that phenotype,
getting it perfect for that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype is the set of observable
characteristics of an individual resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: from the interaction of its genotype with
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genotype is the genetic constitution
of an individual organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we can put a plant in a room and
it will show taco shaped leaves and bright
[SPEAKER_00]: green colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can put the same plant in a
different room and the leaves will not
[SPEAKER_00]: taco at all and they won't get super
bright green.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're putting too much light on it,
it may get a different green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making it too hot, it may do
different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make it cold, it may curl downward
instead of upward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a bunch of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kind of talk about some of the notes
that I have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about another word
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about chemo type
later, but that's a whole nother
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype and how to find a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a phenotype, let's talk about a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got a pack of seeds,
there is a label and an idea of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: expected from these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to pick a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say strawberry starburst
because that's really easy to pick some
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes and talk about flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say strawberry starburst,
you've read the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says strawberry candy and funky gassy
aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the short version.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought the pack because you want
strawberry candy and funky gas aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since that plant came from Arise and
strawberry starburst, we've got potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to see plants that look a little bit like
the Arise and plants that look a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit like strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to see stuff in the
middle that is combinations of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see some that lean a little bit more
one way, some that lean a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: one way, and then some that are 50% and
then some that are kind of more dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how breeding works when you
make an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be probably four or five main
phenotypes you can identify from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, which phenotype do you want is the
main question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they grow, they're going to show a
little bit different expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know that you want this strain
because you've selected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've paid the money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You read the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got traits that you're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something was desirable in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've just got to find the perfect
one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that grows a little
bit taller and takes a little bit longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but puts out more potency and more buds,
or do you want the one that stays short
[SPEAKER_00]: and squatty and gives you a real head buzz
or makes your ears ring if you're so high
[SPEAKER_00]: when you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want the one that doesn't grow
very tall, but makes super strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: candy buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you at that point to see which
phenotype works best for you, for your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're growing for
yourself to smoke medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're growing for
yourself to smoke recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're growing for another
consumer who is a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're growing as a
provider, a free market provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your goal, but if you do,
you can find the plant that works best for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it in a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a screen of green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a sea of green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be just one big plant in a
seven gallon pot left to do whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find different phenotypes within
that pack of seeds that work the best for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to explain it as sometimes you
might say, I want dinner and you decide I
[SPEAKER_00]: want Italian food and we all agree we're
going to go get Italian food, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go to the Italian restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to that Italian restaurant,
you've got a few more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got fettuccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got penne pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got all kinds of other Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to dig into it because
I'm going to make myself hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the Italian food come into the
tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you got all these different
Italian options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got red sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got white sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got no sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got so many options when it comes to
Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a pack of strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is going to be a little bit
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is going to be a little bit gassy and
footy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to be strawberry gas and foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of them is probably not even
going to get your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go that plant right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to finish that and never
grow that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just tell there's one in the batch
that is not for you, but there will be one
[SPEAKER_00]: that is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I find out of a 10 pack,
I usually find two that I can't decide
[SPEAKER_00]: which are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is usually the pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some like it's just frustrating,
but it gets you so high and smells good
[SPEAKER_00]: that you cannot get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another one that is
almost as good, but not as good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but grows easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like, ah, the struggle of the
grow and the extra 10 or 12 days versus
[SPEAKER_00]: that free 10 or 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I even notice 10 or 12 days on the
struggle worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what I find in phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I will share the easier
phenotype with all of my friends so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got that cut for me if I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I keep the harder one for myself
because I know I can handle that harder,
[SPEAKER_00]: more challenging growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenotypes, you're going to find
different stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have kind of, for a while I was really
giving phenotype advice on my crosses and
[SPEAKER_00]: my strains, but I have kind of slowed down
and dialed back and pulled back from doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that because I feel like I could be
causing you, I'm not doing you a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm causing you a detriment by doing that
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to select the phenotype for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should select the phenotype yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've narrowed it down pretty far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred these plants with a solid male that
I know is going to put out good structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: good potency, good resistance to problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to grow with vigor and he's
going to work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to clone well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use females that I know are tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put out good structure, potency,
flavors, aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done the work to know that what
I'm breeding is going to offer you a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good category of phenotypes to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's just up to you to select out of
that batch to find the phenotype that is
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, we're going to go to
Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all agreed on Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get to the Italian restaurant,
I like real heavy, rich, garlicky white
[SPEAKER_00]: sauce kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some capers in there or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want red sauce with like a
sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a sweet red sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making shit up right now off the
top of my head, but we can get both of
[SPEAKER_00]: those at the Italian restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you buy a pack of Italian restaurant
seeds, there's going to be that red sauce
[SPEAKER_00]: and that white sauce phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me pick the phenotype for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick the one that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pick the 77 day phenotype
that gets kind of tall and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, but gets covered in trichomes and
it's just super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink so you don't
hear my throat do that, but that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not pick that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not have been growing for half
of your life and you may not be ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with the plant that takes 77 or 87
days to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that description, you may say get rid
of that plant now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about you choosing the
phenotype that works best for you or your
[SPEAKER_00]: patients or your clients or whatever your
goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may talk about which phenotypes are
available from my crosses and I may kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of highlight things that I've seen and
what's common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually there are three to five,
maybe seven really common phenotypes and
[SPEAKER_00]: an F1 and I observe them because I grow a
lot of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I name some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like the mean girl phenotype and
the chunky girl phenotype of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just call it the Arise
leaning phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a blueberry cookies or a
blueberry butcher plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just really talked myself into a
circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a blueberry butcher plant,
sometimes I'll say that one is Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Jack phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks more like Jack the Ripper or
maybe it looks more like blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just call it the one name phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a plant I call the Sour Balls
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like your balls need a bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a phenotype that I call the Arise
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are phenotypes that I name after the
people who give me the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I maybe allegedly got a cut of my
afterglow back from a friend and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: named after her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the future you will see the
afterglow painted lady cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be made famous because she did a
really good job finding that phenotype for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The painted lady afterglow or the
afterglow cut found by painted lady to the
[SPEAKER_00]: painted lady phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a seed of the afterglow that came
from a bag of afterglow seeds and she grew
[SPEAKER_00]: it and found a beautiful, beautiful
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: She kept it and I acquired a clone of that
somehow and I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still called afterglow but since it's
that special phenotype that painted lady
[SPEAKER_00]: found, it is the afterglow painted lady
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put her name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will be known for finding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's always gonna get some love from me
for searching that out of a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys follow the painted lady on
Cannibals, paintedlady13 or
[SPEAKER_00]: thepaintedladyofinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a great grower, a great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: She kicks ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's out there in Michigan killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she will always be known for that
painted lady cut and that painted lady cut
[SPEAKER_00]: will always have her name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I breed to it, people will say,
well which afterglow did you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say, that painted lady bro and
that'll be the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is the painted lady phenotype of
afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like when I was telling you
guys which phenotypes to sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: to select from my plants, I was kind of
messing you up because then everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: just picking the same phenotypes and why
do you want what I like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you a CD with 10 tracks on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pick the same track that
I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could pick a different track and play
it and jam it and love it just as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: A phenotype, when we grow multiple seeds,
we're going to see variation in those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna find boys, pull the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're gonna have females to select
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna show you different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be stinkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will get a better buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will take longer to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will finish more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will just give you some bullshit
problems to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all different phenotypes and
it's up to you to find the phenotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: you really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a breeder has been making seeds for a
long time and we've narrowed down our
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding process to where things come out
more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stable is not the word I want to use
because they're not stable at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're making F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're seeing phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see this difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see, I just talked to myself
in a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even remember what the fuck I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make seeds, you're gonna see this
variation, this phenotypical variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to pick the variation that works
best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the tall one, the short one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you get to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called a phenohyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run a package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that works best for you,
your garden, your customers, your
[SPEAKER_00]: clientele, your future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can name it if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Arise, the, let's pick a grower,
the Arise Tenasi Gardens cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tenasi may have found a beautiful cut
of Arise and he named it the Tenasi cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he wants to share it out,
he could just say that's Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the Tenasi cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people will know that's the one
that came from Tenasi forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my boy Tenasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made that up and put you in the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I find a pheno?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've done a full podcast on
phenohunts and phenotype selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that you're in love with the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know early.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us will find out very early in
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go like week three, you're like,
that's the one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll, you're already in love
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be the, your favorite all
the way through growing, drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: curing, and smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to say number three is
the champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I will narrow it down to
two or three out of a 10 or 25 pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find my favorite two or three and
then I'll run those two or three side by
[SPEAKER_00]: side again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll do smoke tests and we'll do
extraction tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: See which smokes better, which extracts
better, which washes better, which takes
[SPEAKER_00]: better pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just kind of narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blindly smoke it with all the homies
around and see who likes which one better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is how we do a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grow it, smoke it, and see what works
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, one thing that is always
noticeable, the growers and the consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: often argue over which is better because
the grower doesn't, the grower has to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer doesn't have to think about
this plant was fucking nitrogen deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole time and it gave me a headache
for nine weeks and I was chasing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting it the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoker doesn't think about this one
needs extra water because it's super
[SPEAKER_00]: thirsty or it doesn't think about,
man I had to watch that one every day
[SPEAKER_00]: because it doesn't drink much and if I
overwatered it ever it would give me
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smokers don't think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growers and the smokers are often
choosing different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower wants the one that's going to
grow easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it more fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me on my toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll find out that often times the
one that grows the best and smokes the
[SPEAKER_00]: best are not the same phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to make some
decisions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure I cover them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when it works like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and flowy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say you chose that seed
pack for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got what you're seeking should be in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to find the one that
works the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then somebody asked me if I prefer a large
phenohunt or a small phenohunt and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a very good answer for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment I would do
somewhere between 25 to 100 seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: as the breeder I want to see what that
seed line has got to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find those three to seven
basic phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about three five maybe
seven basic phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I grow a hundred maybe two hundred
seeds I'm going to find things that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people will never see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more population I grow the more
oddities the more outliers I've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I see weird shit as when I
grow a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred or two hundred at a time and
just let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull anything too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see what they all look like and what
they all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a commercial grower approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a breeder's approach in a home
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like and this this is just my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have done the work on the
seeds that you should find a keeper in a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not in a five pack I sell five
packs you will find a keeper in a five
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds and if you don't let me know
we'll make you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done the work by having reliable
male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done the work by having reliable
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tested all of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that my breeding works and I know
that within a five pack you will find at
[SPEAKER_00]: least one keeper and a 10 pack you should
find one amazing keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done the work with the selection of
my breeding stock to make that part easy
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not finding a keeper and a 10
pack of seeds you might want to reconsider
[SPEAKER_00]: who you're buying your seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that they're a bad breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying they're not doing good
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not finding what you want in
a 10 pack are they being advertised and
[SPEAKER_00]: described properly because it said oranges
and chocolate grows in 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought it thinking oranges and
chocolate 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously if it's not doing what you
expected it to do and not making you happy
[SPEAKER_00]: you may need to find another seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody whose descriptions match their
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try to do my best when it comes
to descriptions and outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a lot of feedback from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of my own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of editing and updating because
I want you people to get accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: information and accurate advice on a seed
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got really off topic and
really rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is too hot in here to even focus any
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sweating through my shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a great fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like talking about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel like I could get super rambly
and off topic on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to check my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for this great
question about phenotypes.
