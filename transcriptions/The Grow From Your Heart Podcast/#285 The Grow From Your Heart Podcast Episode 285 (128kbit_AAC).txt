[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is dedicated
to Kevin Perkins Sr., also known as Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pops was little Kev's dad, but he hung out
like he was all of our bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't Kev's dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was everybody's best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, cancer took him and I'm
going to miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pops was a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pops told some really cool stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pops told some fucking questionable
stories that were amazing and fantastical
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'd say, did that shit really
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then one day you'd be hanging out with
Pops and his brother and his brother would
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey Pops, remember that time we did
this amazing shit and you'd say,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit, all those stories Pops told are
fucking real.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of those old guys that done it
all, been there, done that and has fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: conquered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just cool to fucking hang out
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told great stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can listen to Pops tell a story any day
of the fucking week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had time to hear a Pops story and
Pops always had a fucking story for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I hate to cry on my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to cry on any podcast I guess,
but Pops, you've always treated me with
[SPEAKER_00]: love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a cantankerous, honoring
motherfucker and I loved you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm truly going to miss you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to miss your stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to miss dabbing with you and
I'll miss your friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is for Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 285 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am dabbing some
concentrates today that I don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the name of the extract
artist, but I know that it is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gift to me from a friend at the
Indo Expo in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was standing in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody walked up and was like,
Rasta Jeff, I made something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bless you with this sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my girl grew this in our garden and
processed it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, this stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just opened the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like two dabs left in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells fruity at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an undertone of a hidden fruit,
but I've been dabbing on this and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious and great job, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some apothecary dabs sitting
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some viola extract sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some CSC concentrates and this
has been my go-to dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to save some for this part of the
podcast so that I could describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crystals are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure on this, the flavor on this,
the amount of turps to crystals was
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was totally satisfied and impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like an asshole because I cannot
recall the dude's name because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to check into the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was meeting a bunch of people all at
once and this dude showed up with some
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to the podcast,
please send me a message either on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram or Twitter or email me and let
me know what your name is so I can give
[SPEAKER_00]: you an appropriate shout out because your
concentrates are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the sample and the gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a nice Instagram live video
where I smoked some of these dabs I was
[SPEAKER_00]: just talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some extreme oranges,
high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: had some gorilla glue batter and quite a
few dabs in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram live video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody that was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not following me on Instagram,
check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Instagram and follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be a part of the live videos that
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer questions about their gardens,
try to give them advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also just hang out and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to hang out and get a
little bit more content.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got several cool things to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get too far, let's talk about
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some changes to my Patreon page,
my Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do more updating as time goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time goes on here over the next few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking about how I want to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've realized something on my Patreon
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says if you contribute a certain amount
of funding that I will answer your email
[SPEAKER_00]: on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized that several people
contributed that amount and I may or may
[SPEAKER_00]: not have answered your email because
there's not a way, a simple way for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell on some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your name on Patreon doesn't match your
email name and I didn't catch onto that,
[SPEAKER_00]: if somebody didn't point it out to me,
I may not have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you contributed to Patreon and you
feel that I owe you an email answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: please send me an email right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send the email to
growfromyourheartathotmail.com and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey bro, I contributed to the Patreon
campaign and you were supposed to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: my email and you never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will get on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize that I may have missed
one or two of those or maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I missed you and you contributed,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me an email and I will get on that
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, if you did contribute and
I didn't read your email, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel like a jerk for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So message me and I will make it up to you
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm going to continue to adjust the
Patreon campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have somewhere between three
and five different options available for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Patreon contributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will continue to evolve as well
the podcast over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to everybody who has contributed
to Patreon and everybody who will
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the support and it's perfect
timing because my MacBook is starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: slow down and sometimes it kind of worries
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully within the next year,
we can replace this thing with one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those new MacBook Pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little snazzier and a little
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would just use this one for
uploading YouTube videos that might speed
[SPEAKER_00]: that process up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, big shout out to everybody who has
helped me out on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out patreon.com slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in contributing to
the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, enough about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about more interesting cannabis
related stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been keeping you guys updated on some
of my breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got two different projects that are
about 30 ish days apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main one is finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when I am done recording,
I can start cutting down some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That breeding project is, of course,
the Durban poison female and the Stardog
[SPEAKER_00]: female cross to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Durban poison, Stardog,
Platinum Tangi and a couple other select
[SPEAKER_00]: females in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have been pollinated by a rise
and they have been in there for about 65
[SPEAKER_00]: days now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is time to start cutting down some
of those plants and separating them and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them into small pieces and letting
them dry up and then getting the seeds out
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be Durban poison to arise and
Stardog to arise and Platinum Tangi to
[SPEAKER_00]: arise testers very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those get tested, we'll see what they
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out if we want to make them
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out if we want to make F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out if we want to abandon the
project altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the seeds are just about done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to start taking down some of
those plants, letting the plants dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the seeds out, and then we can test
them and decide the future on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've been working on a blueberry
cookies feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have reversed a blueberry cookies plant
and I have pollinated another blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also pollinated the Platinum Tangi,
the strawberry fields, and there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple others in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I need to mention all of
them, but those are about 35 days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just received pollen a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is looking like it took the
pollen well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistils changed colors very quickly
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look really healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that crop needs about 25 to 35
more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will be ready to cut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can let them dry once again,
chop them up into small pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the seeds out of them, and then I will
grow those and see what I have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I like it, I'll make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't like it, we, of course,
abandon the project and try something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are updates on my two most recent
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Durban Poison to arise,
Stardog to arise, Platinum Tangi to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be other surprises in that
room also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have also got blueberry
cookies to blueberry cookies itself to
[SPEAKER_00]: make Femseeds, blueberry cookies S1s,
and then also blueberry cookies to
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum Tangi and blueberry cookies to
strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about those in the future,
but those are the two breeding projects
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm excited about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, of course, I am going to
make more of the Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Jeffrey is Lemon Skunk to Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm doing that, I plan to make
more Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be Feminized Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be Feminized Lemon Jeffrey coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be late this year, but it is in
the works, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my current breeding projects
and my future breeding plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that I like keeping you guys
updated on my breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm really passionate
about, something I get really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of my listeners are
equally as passionate and excited about it
[SPEAKER_00]: as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: New seeds are always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great way to segue into my
next topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next topic is the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indo Expo was in Denver on January 27th
and 28th.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were at the Denver Mart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indo Expo is an industry trade show that
brought a lot of great vendors and
[SPEAKER_00]: educators from Colorado and around the
country, possibly around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there were breeders and quite a
few folks from other countries there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it brought folks from around the world
to display their cannabis industry-related
[SPEAKER_00]: items.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of grow-related stuff,
a lot of packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first day of Indo Expo was
industry day, which meant basically only
[SPEAKER_00]: folks with cannabis businesses or related
to cannabis businesses were invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the always lovely, always beautiful,
always on the fucking move, Jenny Best,
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually part of the street team.
[SPEAKER_00]: She drove all over Southern Colorado and
went to grow stores, dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: grows, whatever ancillary type of business
that she felt like would be a good fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: She drove around and made sure they were
all invited and had passes so that their
[SPEAKER_00]: managers and owners and buyers could all
show up to this event and see what was
[SPEAKER_00]: available for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was industry day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, something happened to where
a lot of those passes were given out to
[SPEAKER_00]: people who were not part of any industry
because it was extra crowded on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposed to be the day where if you
own a grow, you can walk through the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and go see Veg Bloom and Botanicare and
New Millennium and every other company
[SPEAKER_00]: that was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were probably 50 nutrient companies
there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microblyfe was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I saw Nectar of the Gods there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, all of your nutrient companies
were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of other products there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea was that people that owned
grows or dispensaries could walk through
[SPEAKER_00]: and speak directly to the people that run
those companies and they could pitch their
[SPEAKER_00]: products to them without the general
public overwhelming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a lot of general public was
able to get those passes or got in somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: and Saturday was kinda, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, I had a good time,
but it was a little bit overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to talk to all the people that
I wanted to visit with and it kinda,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a little overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing the event at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great fucking time, but it was a
lot of people to deal with on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have to sneak to the car for a
couple of smoke breaks because that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday, however, was supposed to be public
day, but it felt like it kinda got turned
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like there was way more people
there Saturday and Sunday was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to talk to almost all of the booths
I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to find and have a conversation
with all of the people that I was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunday was a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a list here of people that I want
to try and remember to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with the folks from Veg
Bloom for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had great conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They complimented my flowers and my
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew who I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw me a couple of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to our friends at Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walked past the New Millennium
booth, they grabbed me and took pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: with me and treated me like royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to New Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jinx Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Jinx Proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to hang out with Jinx Proof for a
minute and Dung Beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Jinx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Dung.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys support autism and autism
awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to the Davin Granny and
Grumpy Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I walked into the event,
Jenny Beth was like, come to this little
[SPEAKER_00]: gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, who is us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walk in and Trippie G, the edible
dude was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Davin Granny and Grumpy Grandpa and Miss
Jenny Beth were all hanging out waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Davin Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to get a big old granny hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to finally, I think that may have been
the first time I ever actually met Grumpy
[SPEAKER_00]: Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been in the same room with him
before, but I don't think we ever met,
[SPEAKER_00]: hence the name Grumpy Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fucking chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they call him Grumpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just not outgoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really funny because Jenny Beth is a
little overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's really outgoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's kind of a social butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would just go and just go
social everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Grumpy Grandpa and I would just kind
of sit there and watch like, God,
[SPEAKER_00]: look how obnoxious they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else did I run into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Colin Gordon from the Ethos
Collective and Ethos Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to spend probably 45 minutes to an
hour just shooting the shit and talking
[SPEAKER_00]: shop with Colin from the Ethos Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have sent me home with a bag of
everything Ethos has ever bred with maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: six or seven of a few things in there
because they've got my grateful dog in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had great conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about working on stuff in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got great shit coming up in the
future that I can't spill for him,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you guys should check out what Colin
Gordon and Ethos is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great conversation, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever listen to this dude,
thanks for treating me with much respect
[SPEAKER_00]: and hanging out and stepping away from
your booth for a few minutes to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have a conversation with me outside of the
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people saw Colin and myself standing
in the back of his booth just chatting,
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of crowded up and it got a
little congested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of fucked up traffic right there
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to Colin for taking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's making money and he stepped away from
making money to come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Ethos seeds are not cheap,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Twisty Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Walked past Twisty Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a brief conversation, a couple of
high fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, huge shout out to my friends Jeremy
and Cheryl from Love for the Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to hang out with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just do laps around this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you just mill around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an RV show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just walk up and down the aisles and
you look at all the things you want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: and see all the people you want to talk
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird because every time you go up
and down the aisle, you see something you
[SPEAKER_00]: missed last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we kept running into Jeremy and
Cheryl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kept crossing them saying hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into The Dude and Scotty from The
Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into them separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But big shout out to The Dude and Scotty
Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about recording, but Guru wasn't
there with the recording gear on time and
[SPEAKER_00]: things just weren't coming together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a bunch of stoners, we said maybe
next time, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the words hash gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, thanks to The Dude who met
me as I was in line trying to check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, bro, I got a gift for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me some tasty concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some high cannabinoid full spectrum
extract and it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, huge, huge shout out to my friend
known as Mary's Motivation on Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: and on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Mary's Motivation or just Mary
Motivation at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram keeps fucking with people,
but Mary's Motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, my friend Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett, I love you every day, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to hang out more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a ball of positive energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to smoke some turps and high five
and get weird on social media together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good seeing Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Max and Dwayne, TNT extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see those guys very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to bump into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, huge shout out to my friends at Nerds
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nerds Genetics and Brothers Grimm were
sharing a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I walked into there, it felt like
I was walking into Cheers and I was Norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody was happy to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends at Nerds gave me,
I got a pack of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've bred plus some stuff that they've
never released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to grow some of that out and
send them some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly cross some of that stuff to some
iry stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know, but shout out to my
friends at Nerds Genetics for treating
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and Jenny Beth like royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out for quite a while in their
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into Bag Seed Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure to see Bag Seed
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge shout out to an Amsterdam legend
who is in Colorado and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't realize who they're fucking with
when they're talking to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an Amsterdam cannabis legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs a shop in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's known as Chuck the Lemon Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy with the white eyebrows,
a super pale white guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only guy there paler than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to Chuck the Lemon Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bumped into each other a couple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck is a well-known dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a very humble guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always takes a minute to say hi,
ask me how I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bump into people at these events,
sometimes you bump into people and you
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Chuck sees you, he stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes a breath and he says,
Jeff, it's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll put his hand on your shoulder
and say, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looks you into your eyes and he
lets you tell him how you fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ask him back, so how are you,
Chuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tells me how Chuck is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a fucking fake interaction
to look good on social media because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the same business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're two people that actually have
compassion and care about each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing Chuck is always fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Chuck the Lemon Man and
Verde.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, my friend Tony from New Mexico
gave me some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am always dissing on rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin usually tastes like a popsicle stick
or burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hate me all you want for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love smoking BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love batters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love high cannabinoid full spectrum
extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, I met Tony at the
Dude Grows Cup last year and I gave him
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds of the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew the Arise to perfection and then
he pressed the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did something right because it doesn't
taste like burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Tony for the correctly
done rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I bumped into Claire several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Claire?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good seeing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good seeing Claire.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just always got a good smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just such a good ball of energy and
such a sweet lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good seeing you, Claire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of sweet ladies, I ran into Matty
several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matty and Spence were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence is just as tall as me and he's got
the dreadlocks and the big beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So him and I stand out of the crowd very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bumped into Spence and Matty a whole bunch
of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we saw Frosty Organics up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a haircut, you dirty hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Fish and Steph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good seeing you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a whole bunch of other people who,
you guys keep in mind, I eat edibles and
[SPEAKER_00]: take dabs the whole time I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left out some people and I made a whole
bunch of new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all my new friends and all of
the people that I skipped on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did get to see quite a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I missed a few booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that I did make sure to take
note of was all of the seed sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethos was killing it with seed sales,
but there were a couple of booths that
[SPEAKER_00]: had, they were teaming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The booths were fairly priced,
but it was much wiser if two or three seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies would get one booth together and
just vend like crazy out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compound, Genetics, Archive, Exotic,
and Brothers Grimm all had lines around
[SPEAKER_00]: the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethos had a line for a little while,
but man, these guys were killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard some weird things that I think
were bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people tried to claim that people
were paying people to stand in line and
[SPEAKER_00]: people were paying hot chicks to come
around those booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you guys, that's the shit that happens
when your seeds are hot like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was paying anybody to come there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people were all paying to go buy
seeds from those booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy that nobody knew who he was at
that one booth, that's cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew who he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody paid anybody to stand in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people were all standing in line to
pay between $100 and $250 for a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hype was real, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were out there looking for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds were probably the most lucrative
sales, the most lucrative booths,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most profitable booths were the seed
companies by far that weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw, I mentioned before Compound,
Archive, Exotic, Brothers Grimm,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethos, Nerds Genetics, Top Dogs,
Twisties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a bunch of great seed companies
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was walking around with a backpack
filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was giving packs away to my friends
and people that walked up and knew who I
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave a bunch of seeds to my fellow
breeder friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that gave me a pack of seeds
definitely got a pack or two in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeds seemed to be the most popular
thing between me and my friends and most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people that I talked to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there was a whole slew of LED
lighting available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had an LED booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to pitch you their
newest, hottest, or their coolest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this one guy every time I would walk
by, he would be like, put your hand on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd be showing everybody how cool the
LED light was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can actually touch that light
while it's running all day and it never
[SPEAKER_00]: got too hot, which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody had an LED booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else had a CBD product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were tons of CBD products just being
delivered in different ways, sprays,
[SPEAKER_00]: rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you could think of putting a CBD
product into your body, it was available
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were trim machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some trim machines that I
watched fucking destroy product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some trim machines that I
thought might intimidate my trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't ever buy a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not use a trim machine in the
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were a couple there that should
make my trimmers nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of packaging supplies,
tons of packaging supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that goes out of a dispensary
has to be in some sort of a childproof
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got tons of these little bottles
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bottles that you squeeze them and
they pop open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a ton of these fucking things
sitting all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every time I buy concentrates,
they come in one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were companies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or also these little aluminum kind of
style envelopes sort of things with little
[SPEAKER_00]: terry off tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of those available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just anything you can think of to put a
cannabis related product or a seed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the packaging was available for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of pretty cool
clothing booths that were selling
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization promotion t-shirts and just
cannabis related clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with the folks with Normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal had a big booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to one of the guys from Normal
and he actually gave me his card and said
[SPEAKER_00]: that he would like to be on the podcast
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can arrange that, we're going to
get a representative from the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: branch of the National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the longest
[SPEAKER_00]: running cannabis legalization group,
activist group in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get one of their representatives
on the podcast here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I mentioned earlier,
every nutrient company was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use those nutrients, they probably
had a rep there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best part is most of these
companies were giving out free samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg Bloom gave me free stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Millennium gave me, offered to give me
free stuff, but it was big five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: containers and I wasn't carrying that shit
to the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody was giving away free stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the seed companies gave me a free
pack of seeds or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned down more free stuff than I
accepted because I don't, if I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it, if I don't have a space for it
or an idea of how and when I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: use it, I don't feel like I should take a
product from you because you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like myself, if I give somebody
seeds, I want them to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that to go in there safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to go in some dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give me a bottle of nutrients and
it's not Veg Bloom or New Millennium or
[SPEAKER_00]: very, or Mammoth, Mammoth was there also,
by the way, if you don't give me one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those, I'm probably not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're like, take a bottle and
like, no, I'm, I'm pretty locked into what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of them got offended,
but I think some of them, most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: understood like, Oh yeah, thanks for not
taking my product that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: probably give away and I'll never even see
the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, there was a lot of,
a lot of product given being given away
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of great vendors, lots of great reps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another aspect of the event was the free
educational seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not attend any of them because I
wanted to go be social and I wanted to go
[SPEAKER_00]: see all of the booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of friends there that I only
get to see when events like this come
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I skipped on all of the seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did hear great things about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw great pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not attend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is one thing that they offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're there and you are interested
in seminars, they're available,
[SPEAKER_00]: go check them out next year because the
Indo Expo will be back next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I hear, it will be at the same
place around the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't quote me on any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just stuff I've overheard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might not even be any of my business yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, one thing I should say about the
Indo Expo is there was no consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could not consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did have a small food court area with
a couple of vendors, selling food and they
[SPEAKER_00]: also had a bar where you could consume
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no cannabis consumption inside the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty cool about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a couple of people take a dab in
different places and people would just
[SPEAKER_00]: walk up and they'd remind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd kind of be like, hey now,
I know you need to medicate, but this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: no medicating event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't let me see you doing that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't tackle anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't arrest anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said, please don't do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume those folks didn't do it
again because once you get called out like
[SPEAKER_00]: that in an event like that, you're
probably just like, oh shit, I was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: step away from getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no consumption at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were slightly discreet,
they didn't really seem to care if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were consuming out on the grassy knoll
outside because the Lodi's prefer the
[SPEAKER_00]: grassy knoll.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get that movie reference high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they didn't really care if you
went out to your car, if you went out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lawn and talked up a little bit and
then came right back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you weren't smoking out inside
the Denver Mart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to mention is with
the lack of a camera, the Cannabis Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Endo Expo was a great event to get all
of my cannabis industry friends together
[SPEAKER_00]: in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in Pueblo, I'm a little bit,
I'm not in Denver, so I don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody as frequently as I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those people aren't always in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the folks from Veg Bloom, the folks
from New Millennium, a lot of people from
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of other brands and companies got to
come to Colorado and they had a good
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse to come hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without a Cannabis Cup, the Endo Expo
is a good reason for us to come and get
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a nice supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we can't consume, it's still a
great meeting of the minds and a gathering
[SPEAKER_00]: for like-minded folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge shout out to everybody at the Endo
Expo for treating me like royalty,
[SPEAKER_00]: for taking good care of me, for getting me
in and out of the event smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Jenny Beth for making
sure that I had a pass for the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a shout out to our friend
Priscilla for making sure that the Endo
[SPEAKER_00]: went smoothly for Jenny and myself as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny was an employee and Priscilla still
made sure that Jenny had fun while she was
[SPEAKER_00]: attending the event and at the after
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big super thanks to Jenny Beth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking good care of me that
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I gave away a lot of seeds,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave away a lot of packages of iri
genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave away some stuff that has never been
given out before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave out some of the stuff that
everybody has, but I cannot wait to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the photos that come from those freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I want in return is either a
lab test or a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be a happy camper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Endo Expo was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be there next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an email that kind of relates to
the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off and it says, if you ever
read this on the air, my first name is
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, but let's hold off on the last name
until I'm legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, Hey Rasta Jeff, my name is
Nick and I've been listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast for at least a year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Nick, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I finally got caught up and just
wanted to thank you for what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have followed your advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my small two by four home grow and
I've had great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad it's working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I've had four successful harvests
at home and I'm working on my fifth
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your positive attitude about life
and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can honestly say you single-handedly
pushed me to follow my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I'm glad I was able to push
somebody to follow their passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid, get up and do what you
want to do because you'll resent yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll resent your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I was able to light that fire
under your ass and get you moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where does it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I will be turning 21 at the
beginning of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you how excited I am to
get my badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by getting his badge, he means his
marijuana enforcement division badge so
[SPEAKER_00]: that he is able to work in the Colorado
medical marijuana or recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana industry legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that works there has to have a
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it requires a rigorous background
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a little bit of money and you
have to be 21 and you have to have a clean
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy is waiting to turn 21 to get
his marijuana enforcement division badge
[SPEAKER_00]: because the message says I want to be a
grower in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been trying to get my name out
and educate myself as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last few years, I'm up just slightly
north of Denver and was hoping to catch
[SPEAKER_00]: you at the Indo Expo last week,
but I don't think we ever crossed paths
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was all over that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several people that say they
never saw me and I'm surprised cause I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: the same shit like five times,
but I'm and I'm tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am a white dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the big cheesy smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually wearing sunglasses indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, next time you see me, man,
just walk up, say hi, introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm easy to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the message goes on to say,
I admire everything you do and stand for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hope we can maybe sesh and talk about
plants someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll attach a few pics of the home grow
just flipped into flower two days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he tells me what strains he's
grown in the email with keep making people
[SPEAKER_00]: happy from Nick and Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate this message, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, first of all, you listen to the
podcast and you're all caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I inspired you to do what you want to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are out there trying to educate
yourself and get your name out there as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as possible so that you can get
yourself a position when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice right now, do not get yourself
in trouble before you were old enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: even get this badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuck it up before you get the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, education is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn a lot about trellising and canopy
control and stuff like that, because
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be, if you starting to grow as a
pro tech, you're going to be the one
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising and bottoming and cutting off
all the bottom shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get familiar with that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you plan on getting into the
industry and you're a youngster like you
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you're going to have to earn the
respect of your peers in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that have been doing this
for way before we had medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were doing it illegally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are the lead growers or
cultivation directors at facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to have to work under
somebody that's been doing it for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time and has their methods figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you're going to go in there
and introduce your methods to a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares how you grow at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we do it at the big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it works at the big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we will continue to do it at
the big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will adjust to our style or you will
adjust to the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how it goes in a big grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there ready to learn their style,
but know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also don't be afraid to start off as a
trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be a little a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trimmer is the entry level position in
any grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to sweep the floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to clean the bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you show that you can show up on time
and follow instructions and think for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself without fucking something up,
that's when you will be allowed to advance
[SPEAKER_00]: in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a cultivation director, as the boss of
several people in a grow, I pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to every person and the way that they
handle every task I give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can't follow instructions,
I cannot trust them in the big grow
[SPEAKER_00]: without guidance over the weekend or at
all by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to have one of my assistant
managers in there keeping an eye on those
[SPEAKER_00]: people because they are fucking savages
and they could mess something up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those people get put right back on the
trim table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you kind of thought that this would be
a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did shit I didn't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to the trim room and trim some
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they realize, oh,
I'm not supposed to do shit that Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't say, we'll bring them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they fuck up, back to the trim table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trimming, you can't mess up
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut buds in half or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we find out if you can be on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out if you can follow
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out if you're fucking capable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out if you're going to mess up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we add more stuff slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this room is going to come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should defoliate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring you in the room and say,
defoliate this whole table in the next two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't move off of this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check on you every 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on that table defoliating,
you're following instructions doing as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're told.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're over at the other table pulling
leaves off the bottom, you're fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing what I told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put you back in the trim
table until next time you come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: can follow instructions for 30 minutes
without fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready to go in there, follow
instructions, do as you're told,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow with the team, assimilate to their
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to force your style on their
stuff and never take your bugs and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: problems to your work grow.
