spectrum extract This is a blend of

package The flavor is described as sour
[SPEAKER_00]: apple fuel and soft fruit.

part I feel like I may have been skipped
[SPEAKER_00]: on that soft fruit portion of the flavor
However, I do appreciate and enjoy that
[SPEAKER_00]: sour apple and fuel flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice buzz to it on the back Of
the package it says the product does

[SPEAKER_00]: don't be shy send me a message and I will
fulfill my commitments also I've noticed a
[SPEAKER_00]: few people were posting that patreon did
not renew for them for some reason Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: is an automatic renewal service several
people posted a message that it did not
[SPEAKER_00]: auto renew if You think you are
contributing to patreon and you did not

contributing to the patreon Contributors
[SPEAKER_00]: which you think you may be contributing to
not just my show, but there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: shows You may be contributing to as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do contribute to several patreon
campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sure I'm still hooking all of them
up They're all getting their contributions
[SPEAKER_00]: But just a reminder make sure that your
patreon is going through because some
[SPEAKER_00]: people for some reason There's just did
not go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is enough rambles for
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the Obvious part of the
podcast you may have noticed by now if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were watching on the audio or on the video
version Of the podcast that I have got a
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet new setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could see the wall behind me
It's got a fresh coat of gray paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes the video pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it look super fresh We got a
brand new table got some brand new chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this table It's kind of higher up
than the old table was the old table gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me like that slouching down Like slouched
over your meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a dinner table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of a higher table It gives
you just a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting it gives me a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm sitting up more not as
slouchy Just more presentable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm ready to present.
[SPEAKER_00]: My chair is also a little bit taller It's
more like a bar stool with the back on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and comfy It's got some padding
on it But this new setup makes me feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I am more in a presentation mode less
of a chill out mode So this should improve
[SPEAKER_00]: my attitude and my attitude was fine
before but it should improve my
[SPEAKER_00]: performance here on the podcast
subconsciously also I got this sweet new
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Rogan mic if you're watching you could
see the sweet mic setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making me sound great I think if you
are only listening in the audio format,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of this new format?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got the sweet mic arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a cloud lifter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a brand new recording device I'm
actually recording with a pod cat zoom for
[SPEAKER_00]: let me try that all over again I'm
actually recording with a zoom pod track P
[SPEAKER_00]: for that's really hard to say those are a
lot of the same words in a sentence there
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to Run the sound I can get my
audio into my headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get the audio into the camera I can
play the background music at the press of
[SPEAKER_00]: a button which makes life very easy for
somebody trying to produce by themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got all new audio equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also got some sweet lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well lit and it is not just from the
dabs this time I've got a light here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a light here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a light behind me giving me some
space from the wall I really think it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of the new appearance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the obvious part There is a brand new
camera if you're watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could tell that video quality
is nice and crispy It looks so much
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that I was ready for 4k,
but that's what we're doing I'll get some
[SPEAKER_00]: sun on this forehead for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, but anyway, I wanted to thank
everybody for the patreon Contributions
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is what covered this new
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make a video for patreon But if you
did not catch that on patreon,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure that you heard my
thank you Thank you without all the
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon contributions this new set Up
would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was I wasn't super expensive,
but there was some money to put into this
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a lot of gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a brand new camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some manual labor done We had
some painting done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some new lights put in above us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to do a lot of shopping I am still
seeking some kind of background stuff I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like we could use a plant or
something back here on the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I think it looks marvelous I
want your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of the new video setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of the new audio setup
and what would I put right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any decoration ideas for some
Shit that could go here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking like a plant and a shelf or
something But really what I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: has not jumped out at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when it is the right thing
I'll say that's the shit right there that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes behind me on the podcast,
but I would love your feedback Let me know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think video audio decorative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is on your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love some feedback also Be patient
with me because there is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: learning curve while I learn this new
equipment Things will not be perfect right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they will I don't know I don't
expect things to go smoothly on the first
[SPEAKER_00]: try They never do and if they do they go
wrong on the fourth or fifth try anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: But bear with me while I adjust to the new
equipment and to the learning curve,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do encourage you Please please keep
sending me all of the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all of your grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those keep the show moving I also still
want all of the feedback in words of
[SPEAKER_00]: encouragement and updates and corrections
and all of that stuff Keep that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com Please don't stop at the
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback the updates the questions While I
adjust to the new equipment keep sending
[SPEAKER_00]: me stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it also I just wanted to say about
the new setup patreon saw it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a video to patreon They got to
see a couple of teases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw some of the equipment before you
did They saw a full-length video before
[SPEAKER_00]: you did so follow us on patreon patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I feel like I have been kind of
rambling on enough about the new setup
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the main topic of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Patreon messages and some
other messages This one was on the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the list and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey, man I don't want to come off
negative about anything you do but There's
[SPEAKER_00]: always a but it says but I have concerns
about you spending a lot of money on gear
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather you put it into your garden
I understand those may be two of the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I typically listen on Google podcast
while I'm driving So I wouldn't appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: the video format as much as others the
other concern with the video Is the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will take up an extreme amount of
your time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that It says video editing
software takes an enormous amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn and once learned it can easily
take a hundred times The amount of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: edit those videos as it does just to shoot
them It also takes away from your time for
[SPEAKER_00]: your personal replies to so many
cultivators who rely on you I really like
[SPEAKER_00]: the simple format and how you can turn
audio into a learning experience for me I
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't have the time to sit and watch
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although many others May and it will help
them tremendously keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let this discourage you and your
path These are just my thoughts on a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of gear and the time commitment it'll take
in which to utilize That alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is wonderful feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, um, bro I know you only listen on
Google podcast, but the show has been in a
[SPEAKER_00]: video format since around episode 500 I
think we had Mike on on episode 530.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 582 I've been doing a video For at
least 50 episodes now and I don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like it has taken away from the quality of
the content of the podcast in any way I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I'm keeping up with my
commitment to my promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I have slacked I feel
like it is only getting better With this
[SPEAKER_00]: new setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some more room I've got some more
ideas people have been asking to see more
[SPEAKER_00]: visual aids on the show and that is coming
I do intend to visually teach on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only relay so much information I can
only convey so many ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only paint such a good picture with
my words some things I'm going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a plant out and show you exactly what
I'm talking about Show you step by step
[SPEAKER_00]: what I need you to do what I want you to
do What would be better for your grow so I
[SPEAKER_00]: do need this visual platform for teaching
So I think this will be a way to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: people better to reach a larger audience
And just give a better lesson and
[SPEAKER_00]: education and that's what we're here for
so I will not let the video format
[SPEAKER_00]: distract from the Quality of the overall
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not let it take away from my
interaction with my audience the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who need my support my friends my family
Honestly, I've been doing the video show
[SPEAKER_00]: for quite a few episodes now It took me a
minute to learn editing software,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I did it on the fly I did it I gave
myself a crash course and I always find
[SPEAKER_00]: the quick ways to do things I try to make
a very productive workflow for myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed a way to do that Learning video
so that happened quite quickly the
[SPEAKER_00]: software Was it's in my MacBook already so
that was basically free the equipment was
[SPEAKER_00]: covered Honestly by patreon all of this
new equipment even this old MacBook was
[SPEAKER_00]: covered by patreon contributions So this
money was owed to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was owed to the people watching the
show So I didn't spend a bunch of money on
[SPEAKER_00]: gear that wasn't needed I spent money that
was given to me by patreon Contributors to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the show better so they are getting
what they paid for I think I owed that to
[SPEAKER_00]: them if I would have Put it in my garden
if I would have spent that patreon money
[SPEAKER_00]: on my garden that would have been ripping
off the patreon Contributors that would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been going to a totally different
Avenue a different business my own
[SPEAKER_00]: personal thing or my own business This is
where that funding needed to stay So I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave it back to the show by doing this and
I do have more things coming and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: costs of doing a podcast But I feel like
this was the necessary move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I mostly covered your your
concern here, bro There will never be a
[SPEAKER_00]: beat missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never miss a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to learn some editing stuff
There may be a couple of glitches in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recordings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get 120% like you were before
but I promise you I'll give you 90% and
[SPEAKER_00]: once I get it learned you'll be getting a
hundred I'm giving a hundred percent of my
[SPEAKER_00]: effort But the show may not be a hundred
percent what it was because learning new
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, but I promise you 90% I won't put
out anything better than a 90 if it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: 85 we're gonna rerecord it and fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry So I appreciate your concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for addressing that concern But
I think I've got it under control,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude I can edit these videos quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could shoot them super quickly and You
guys will never notice that I changed
[SPEAKER_00]: anything other than the fact that the
videos look fucking super great now
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright that came from our friend JG who's
a patreon contributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you JG for the great message I look
forward to hearing from you in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I do have another message that
I'd like to jump right into this one came
[SPEAKER_00]: from grandpa Mark and it says what's up
Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a flowering question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up grandpa mark good to hear from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got An answer for your flowering
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have two sun kiss plants and one
lemon Jeffrey All of them are at day 18 of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower makes total sense so far It says
the sun kiss plants are loaded with buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the lemon Jeffrey is hardly hardly
showing signs of flower Do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't seem to be able to attach a pic
Yes, it is challenging to attach a photo
[SPEAKER_00]: in patreon A couple of people have told me
that you can always just email it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics at hotmail.com Or grow
from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those will get to my inbox,
but let's talk about this Our friend is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing two different types of genetics
And one of them looks like it's loaded
[SPEAKER_00]: with buds and the other one isn't showing
any buds This one is being stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why may this be happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Bred both of these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot about these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the sun kiss takes off much
more quickly I know that platinum tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: that it came from sets into flower Much
earlier than the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I think that what is happening
here is just its basic genetics Just the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of the plant that sun kiss is
gonna set into flower Really quickly and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to finish more early earlier
Than that lemon Jeffrey the lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: plants gonna take a little bit longer to
set into bud But once it does it is it is
[SPEAKER_00]: really going to take off and give you
gigantic buds But it will take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer than those sun kiss plants So
what I think is happening is it just takes
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit longer that plant is a longer
growing plant I'm gonna say that your sun
[SPEAKER_00]: kiss will probably take 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lemon Jeffrey is probably gonna take
72 days Somewhere along that time the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey will catch up and or surpass
the growth of that sun kiss That is my
[SPEAKER_00]: first suspicion My other suspicion is that
perhaps just maybe there is a light leak
[SPEAKER_00]: that is getting to the lemon Jeffrey that
is not Affecting those sun kiss plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: the lemon Jeffrey right in the front of
the tent where that zipper is is it
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it right underneath the ducting port
where some light could be coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my suspicion that perhaps possibly
I'm not accusing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an option I'm just trying to cover
bases here There could be a light leak in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room The way to solve that is to go in
the room and turn off all of the lights in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow environment But leave any of the
external lights on that may be on during
[SPEAKER_00]: the day So if this little square is the
grow room turn off I'm making a square
[SPEAKER_00]: with my hands for the people listening I
turn off all the lights in your square
[SPEAKER_00]: believe these outer lights On and go in
your grow space and see do these outer
[SPEAKER_00]: lights shine into your grow environment If
you can see your hand in front of your
[SPEAKER_00]: face, it is too light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need 100% total absolute pitch black
darkness in there So that is my first
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption is perhaps just maybe you've
got a light leak in there preventing that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant from going into flower Alright
grandpa mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to an update Let me know
what you find this message Was sent a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days ago by the time this episode comes
out your plants will have progressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what's going on, brother I
look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I do have another great message
This one is going to take us a few minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: to address which is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it This one says
help and it's they're serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in capitals and an exclamation point
It says help I have powdery mildew powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew is easy to solve It is easier to
prevent and we're gonna talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't panic when you have powdery Mildew a
lot of people go into full freak out mode
[SPEAKER_00]: and they cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread the mildew Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk a little bit about it
says I would love to you love fucking let
[SPEAKER_00]: me try that again I would love for you to
go through what needs to be done to banish
[SPEAKER_00]: this from inside my garden Then it says
neem oil is on the way Return it don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: the neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never recommend neem oil neem oil is
unhealthy It is not good for your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good for reproductive systems
It's just not a good product to be using
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got much better products We can use
also it will never go away that flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: will be on your plants forever When you
harvest them when you dry them you cure
[SPEAKER_00]: them you may concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna taste like shit Let's avoid
neem oil do your own research on the
[SPEAKER_00]: damage that neem oil and neem products do
to your Reproductive system or can
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly do to a human reproductive
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all like our reproductive stuff At
least most of us do anyway do your own
[SPEAKER_00]: research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that This it says I've
been growing and learning about making my
[SPEAKER_00]: own medicine for a little bit over a year
I am so grateful to have found your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has taught me so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am grateful that you have found us as
well We're gonna make a great team
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says keep doing the fantastic job truly
sad 70 Thank you for the great compliment
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message right here
on the new podcast format.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great topic to cover on this new
format This is a really good subject to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about in the new studio space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's quit rambling And get right into
it a moment ago I said the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat powdery mildew is to prevent it once
you've got it It can be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be scary if you're moving it from
garden to garden, but I know how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of it We've got to figure out the
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the causes of your powdery
mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably something happening in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room is not right We all think we have
built this amazing grow room But if you
[SPEAKER_00]: put monitors in there if you put equipment
in there to tell you that everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate and things are the way you need
them to be Sometimes that plant is the
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor that tells you something is fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first Assumption and I know I'm
assuming we're probably got big chances of
[SPEAKER_00]: being wrong But my assumption is that the
VPD the vapor pressure deficit is off in
[SPEAKER_00]: this room It is probably too moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably some stagnant air in
there probably lacking circulation Which
[SPEAKER_00]: will create what is known as a micro
climate You may have a fan blowing right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but over here in this area There are
a couple of leaves that have started
[SPEAKER_00]: touching each other and the lights just
shine and just right in there to make A
[SPEAKER_00]: hot spot and those leaves are touching
they create some moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fan doesn't give a shit about those
leaves over there It's blocked by all
[SPEAKER_00]: these other leaves micro climate happening
over there problems can ensue So we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: micro climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an off VPD There's also moisture
too much moisture in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that moisture being caused by the
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they respirating enough moisture to
cause too much humidity in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you over watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you watering just right but you don't
have enough extraction to evacuate the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity from the room Do you not have a
dehumidifier?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that can trip
that can contribute to this So the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing we need to do is fix the room The
room is probably the cause of the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the VPD dialed in we need
to get some monitors We need to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to see what the humidity is We
need to find out if there are temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and or humidity spikes when the lights go
off and when the lights come on because
[SPEAKER_00]: That is mainly when you're gonna see a
giant humidity spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those spikes are what caused the powdery
mildew Also, I just thought of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even on my notes major shifts in
day and night temperature will contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: to your powdery mildew issues You don't
want it to be more than five to ten
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees cooler in the night cycle than it
is in the day cycle So when those lights
[SPEAKER_00]: shut off, you don't want it to get any
more than ten degrees cooler We also don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want the humidity to spike or drop any
more than five Or ten percent in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to get the room dialed in we
need some monitors We need to know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at all times in that room Of
course, I recommend the PL minder unit
[SPEAKER_00]: from our friends at PL grow they make
great equipment You can open it up on your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone and you can see what the VPD is in
your grow room at all times Is it too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too wet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also give you a warning of some
equipment failed because it'll get too
[SPEAKER_00]: warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll beep It'll say hey, bro,
it's getting kind of hot in here and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can either drive home Or go to the grow
figure it out have somebody at the grow go
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and figure out Why is this room
getting too humid or getting too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice fail safe piece of technology
So I recommend some equipment in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room to let us know what is going on It's
a little bit late for that because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have already told you there's a
fucking problem So now we have got to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is too late to do preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too late to dial in the room It's not
too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to dial in the room or you're
just going to keep getting PM So figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what is causing it probably too much
humidity stagnant Air not enough airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now let's treat for powdery mildew
This is going to be effective in the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: state or later into flower A lot of people
refuse to spray something in the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: stage But at this point if you've got a
heavy powdery mildew infestation You've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the option of having powdery mildew or
applying a couple of products I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: products I recommend you will learn and
you will feel safe applying these So let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about how we are going to treat your
powdery mildew on your cannabis plants The
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing we want to do Is the first
thing is wear gloves and if it is really
[SPEAKER_00]: really bad If the powdery mildew is thick
in there, you may want some kind of a mask
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a respirator You don't want to
breathe in those powdery mildew spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been exposed to a bunch of powdery
mildew and several grows It will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your lungs burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make your throat hurt It'll make you
feel generally lethargic for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days if you get exposed to too much
powdery mildew spores I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: technical words for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all felt like shit Some of us had a
bloody nose from being in a grow that was
[SPEAKER_00]: just fucking tainted with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to rescue it We decided to
give up that grow that job was not for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of consulting but We can get
rid of powdery mildew wear your protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment wear some gloves wear a
respirator wear a mask Maybe even wear
[SPEAKER_00]: some goggles if it's that bad in there You
might want to cover your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we are going to do is we
are going to heavily defoliate these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants Preventative defoliation would have
helped you prevent getting powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I talk about defoliation
Defoliating so heavily not just in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grows But in personal grows if
those leaves weren't there there wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have been opportunities for powdery mildew
to develop on those leaves Also,
[SPEAKER_00]: if those leaves weren't there they
wouldn't have been respirating and
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiring enough moisture to cause a
powdery mildew issue in the room That
[SPEAKER_00]: would have helped mitigate that problem So
let's defoliate all of the bigger leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room need to be removed if they've
got powdery mildew on there Let's get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of those leaves immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different size leaves on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the leaves That are close to
the buds and then we've got those leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: with a long petiole sticking off of the of
the plant So you've got a long branch and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a big fat leaf if you've got those
long branches coming off Let's take that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf right off if the petiole is turned
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely time for it to go That
is when I determine that leaf can go so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's remove all of the big leaves
Anything with powdery mildew needs to go
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's small and it's up against the bud
We can leave that because we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply a spray to that that will remove
that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's defoliate semi heavy defoliation,
maybe a heavy defoliation depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Infestation and how bad the powdery mildew
is let's go in there and pull off leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: This will do a couple of things This will
get rid of the powdery mildew that is
[SPEAKER_00]: there and slow it from spreading This will
also slow the respiration and
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration of the plants and it will
slow the humidity and the spread of the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew Also, you're just taking
some of it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're throwing the problem in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Let's defoliate Then here is where we
get to the spraying portion of treating
[SPEAKER_00]: for powdery mildew Hopefully we're in veg
you can spray heavily in veg if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower You need to use caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still spray 30% hydrogen peroxide
or don't use them both you guys 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide or a product called zero
tall can be applied to your flowering or
[SPEAKER_00]: vegging plants to help get rid of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the first two products I will go
for the 30% hydrogen peroxide may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: May not be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The zero tall may not be available You can
find one or the other wherever you are one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the growth stores or some sort of
supply store will have one or the other in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area I apply those at 45 I start with
30 milliliters per gallon if my problem is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty radical we will go up to 45
milliliters per gallon of zero tall or
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide maybe 50 maybe 60 if
that problem is fucking crazy start at 30
[SPEAKER_00]: mills per gallon 30 milliliters per gallon
of water of zero tall or hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: and Just spray that all over the plants if
you're in veg spray it heavily wash that
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew off of there you can spray
the plants and watch the mist hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking plant and you can watch that
powdery mildew run down the plants keep
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying if you're in veg there is no risk
no trouble of just fucking spraying the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of them they won't get they've
already got powdery mildew you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get bud rot you're not going to
cause problems we're in here spraying this
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide or the zero tall you
will smell the cleanliness happening here
[SPEAKER_00]: I go again with my safety talk when you
are applying zero tall or hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide Abso-fucking-lutely wear personal
protective equipment you need gloves when
[SPEAKER_00]: you are mixing the zero tall and hydrogen
peroxide you need goggles while you are
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing and applying the zero tall and or
hydrogen peroxide you need a respirator
[SPEAKER_00]: think about this you are applying a
product that will kill a powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: that will kill a lot of things you are
applying it with the sprayer you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles in the air if you're using a
sprayer that makes very small bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: you're breathing those in if you don't
have a respirator over your face you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to breathe in bubbles that destroy
microbes and destroy mildews because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna damage your lungs it's going
to destroy good things inside of your body
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want to do that it is semi
caustic I think that is the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: word and it will fuck you up that's the
bottom line it will fuck you up wear your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment please if
you get hurt spraying peroxide or zero
[SPEAKER_00]: tall remember Rasta Jeff said so many
times wear that personal protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment we cannot be held liable I am
not liable you got to wear your shit even
[SPEAKER_00]: the company that sold you the bottles is
not liable because they printed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle not our fucking fault if you don't
wear the shit because you're dumb so wear
[SPEAKER_00]: the personal protective equipment when
mixing and applying the zero tall and
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide also stay out of that
room for a couple of hours after you spray
[SPEAKER_00]: it as well you don't need to be in there
touching that shit getting that stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: your skin it is bad for your skin where am
I here the smallest bubbles are the best
[SPEAKER_00]: like I just said a moment ago over spring
very small bubbles you want micro bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can use a fogger do that I'm not
sure if an ionizer and atomizer is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want but I do prefer the smallest bubbles
possible that's how we know we get the
[SPEAKER_00]: most coverage now we're going to spray
zero tall and or hydrogen peroxide if
[SPEAKER_00]: those products don't work I said you could
beef it up to about 50 maybe 60
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per gallon but that may begin
to burn your plants if you go any higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than that you're running the risk of
messing up your garden so be careful test
[SPEAKER_00]: that on one or two plants before you go
hard there are a couple of other products
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recommend to help mitigate the
problems of powdery mildew these products
[SPEAKER_00]: are called cease and double nickel I'll
say cease again because I said that really
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily I apologize cease cease and double
nickel are great products we can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of powdery mildew we can use them
early into flower once you're later in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and have some buds I would kind of
kind of hold off on the cease and double
[SPEAKER_00]: nickel and go extra hard on the zero tall
and hydrogen peroxide those two products
[SPEAKER_00]: the zero tall and hydrogen peroxide they
dissipate and evaporate very quickly but
[SPEAKER_00]: they eat and destroy powdery mildew on
contact so hose it down with that now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the cease and double
nickel I recommend both of those products
[SPEAKER_00]: again at 45 milliliters per gallon of
water you can use them individually or you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use them together you can also use
them in conjunction with the zero tall
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about that it is okay to use
zero tall and cease but you cannot use
[SPEAKER_00]: zero tall and double nickel the way I
remember that is no nickel zero tall and
[SPEAKER_00]: no nickel the reason for that is the zero
tall will destroy the beneficial bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the double nickel and render it
useless so when you apply it to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you're basically just applying an inert
dead product and zero tall so you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 milliliters of cease and 30 milliliters
of zero tall together but you cannot use
[SPEAKER_00]: can not do not use zero tall and double
nickel together I really hope I said and
[SPEAKER_00]: made that clear you can use zero tall and
cease you can use cease and double nickel
[SPEAKER_00]: but you cannot use zero tall and double
nickel zero tall kills double nickel is
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that works it makes it a waste of
your money so you can mix up multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: products and you can apply those to your
plants I would spray twice a week to start
[SPEAKER_00]: off see if that is working for you my main
routine my preventative sprays are to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray Monday and Thursday if we see a
problem we definitely add one maybe two
[SPEAKER_00]: more sprays to the week we will spray
every other day if we see something
[SPEAKER_00]: popping up in a commercial cultivation
facility I cannot fuck around I cannot let
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem get out of control as soon as we
see it we begin treating it and you should
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same in any grow if it's your
personal grow your commercial grow get on
[SPEAKER_00]: it because if you don't get on it it will
get away from you very very quickly I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to recap again please make sure to
wear your personal protective equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: another very important thing when you
apply anything to the plants if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide if it's a boost spray whatever
you're spraying in there write it down
[SPEAKER_00]: that way I just said spray every three
days you're stoned bro I'm stoned too
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably gonna forget the last time
you sprayed write that shit down it is
[SPEAKER_00]: real easy you could take a note in your
phone you can tell Siri to make a note hey
[SPEAKER_00]: Siri make a note that I sprayed the plants
today at 330 Siri will do that shit for
[SPEAKER_00]: you make a note of it that way there is
record document that those plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: been sprayed and when they were sprayed
you guys hear Siri talking to me I woke
[SPEAKER_00]: Siri up she's saying some shit not even
gonna edit that out that was fucking funny
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Siri for always helping us
out she probably wrote that note that I
[SPEAKER_00]: said to write to that's fucking funny you
guys wear personal protective equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: write down your sprays spray twice a week
if you need to step up your sprays pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the plants you may by
spraying a lot you may start doing damage
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants but how much damage is that
powdery mildew doing to your plants we do
[SPEAKER_00]: not want to consume powdery mildew we
don't want to smoke it we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it we don't want to extract it it
is bad for your lungs it is bad for your
[SPEAKER_00]: patients it's bad for your customers it's
bad for business so let's get rid of that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit now here are a couple of other things
we should talk about if you are working in
[SPEAKER_00]: a grow that has powdery mildew always
sanitize even if you don't have powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew this is basic general practice
always sanitize your scissors and your
[SPEAKER_00]: tools when you are done working if you're
working on a group of plants I try to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it by a strain or a table after this table
if I've got two strains on the table I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do it after all I do the tangies now clean
the scissors now after I do all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries clean the scissors again that
way I don't move anything from one strain
[SPEAKER_00]: to another from one table to another just
because shit does happen and in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environment things can get out
of control quite quickly and I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit of an investment on the line
and it's not my money so we've really got
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat things the minute we see them
we've got to be very careful we got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative so clean your scissors clean
your tools try to have dedicated grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing I don't wear these clothes in the
grow I've got specific clothes that I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: throw on and go in the grow and as I come
out I'll just throw them in a certain spot
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bedroom or wherever then I'll
change clothes and put these in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: so those are always there's one spot in
the bedroom that's got dirty clothes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are for the grow and one spot that's got
fresh clothes for the day just right where
[SPEAKER_00]: I change clothes normally they're just
right there chilling so you just swap in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out of them doesn't take that long
have special clothes when you are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it is important to protect yourself I
recommend you always wear long sleeves and
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves in the grow the lights are they
can't be good for you no matter what kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of lights you're using they can't be good
for your skin I don't want you to get skin
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer I don't want you to get any
problems with your body from being exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow lights I wear a long sleeves in
the grow most of the time also that keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: me protected from pesticide exposure we've
sprayed in this case we sprayed cease and
[SPEAKER_00]: double nickel and whatever else we're
gonna spray we don't want to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff on our skin so wear long sleeves
when you rub up against the plants it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just rubbing up on your shirt you don't
get a pesticide exposure also a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are just straight-up allergic to
cannabis plants they'll get a rash also
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to be all fucking sticky
all day from rubbing up on the plants some
[SPEAKER_00]: people like it some people don't want it
wear your gloves it's good to have gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: on again touching the plants they've got
pesticides on them everything in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: has been hit with the pesticide once
you've sprayed so everywhere you touch is
[SPEAKER_00]: a pesticide zone if you got a face itch if
your eye itches if you got a booger in
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose you don't need to rub it with
your hand that's got pesticides on it pull
[SPEAKER_00]: off your glove scratch your eye pick the
booger get that hair out of your mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is going on take a drink of your
soda put on a couple of gloves and go back
[SPEAKER_00]: to it you don't need to touch your face
with contaminated gloves you don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get pesticides on your hands let's think
about grow room safety let's live for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and take good care of ourselves
we thrive to take good care of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants the plants want to take good care
of us we should take care of ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: while we were at it all right also while
you are spraying I'm gonna say this one
[SPEAKER_00]: last time when you were spraying please
protect yourself with goggles gloves the
[SPEAKER_00]: personal appropriate personal protective
equipment clothing and gloves just take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of yourselves guys I don't want you
to get hurt doing something that I taught
[SPEAKER_00]: you to do I've got a cover my ass you
cover your ass and your body your eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: your face and your hands all right I hope
I taught you a lot about treating powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew don't use the neem oil I recommend
zero tall or 30% hydrogen peroxide not the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that you get at Walmart not the
stuff from Walgreens you need the good
[SPEAKER_00]: potent 30% hydrogen peroxide spray those
at about 30 to 50 milliliters per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: one or the other don't mix those if you
want to buy a commercial grade fungicide I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend cease and double nickel again it
is okay to cease and zero tall it is not
[SPEAKER_00]: okay to zero tall and double nickel always
wear your personal protective equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: all right I think that covers the powdery
mildew question I want to thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: the great question and I want to thank you
