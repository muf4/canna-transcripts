[SPEAKER_00]: The question from lucky bowl packer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short question, but it's a good
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What caused your love for the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been listening to
this show for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people are brand new listening to
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people may not know why or how I fell
in love with growing ganja, cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja, consuming, breeding, being an
advocate for ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I fall in love with this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to dedicate this whole
episode, no matter how short or quick this
[SPEAKER_00]: reply is, just to talking about how and
why I fell in love with the ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wrote down in my outline now that
I'm rambling a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize how much more there is to this
plant in my life than I even wrote down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few short notes here,
but this plant has done a lot for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My love, my passion for this plant has
taken me very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have built a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've built a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've built a career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've built a life off of this plant,
off of my love and passion and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this relationship with myself
and the plant, it is very reciprocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give a lot to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you guys a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this plant and in turn, you guys give
me a lot in return and the plant is giving
[SPEAKER_00]: me a lot in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do live a very blessed and maybe a
privileged life and that is because of my
[SPEAKER_00]: love and my passion for this plant added
with a few other skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without this plant, my skills and
passions might not have lined up the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm right where I'm supposed
to be because of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's given me a good life, a good future,
a good career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not be as mentally, physically,
spiritually financially, socially stable
[SPEAKER_00]: as I am without this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be a different person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been consuming cannabis for my mid
early teenage years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now in my mid to late 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still consuming strongly heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started as a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first love, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all fall in love with smoking the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after I was smoking, I began growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know if you made me decide
between smoking, growing and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one I would choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing and breeding have a good chance of
winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you made me quit one, smoking might be
the one that I eliminated, which sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: wild because for a lot of people,
that's the most important aspect of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I get older, I understand what I'm able
to do with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow it and breed it in a special
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people in the past 10 years have
really caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some amazing growers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this cannabis revolution was new,
a lot of us growers that were growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: learning quickly and being advanced at our
skills, we were kind of a very special
[SPEAKER_00]: niche group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now my skills are not rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people out there that
have surpassed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my apprentices, they now grow in
larger facilities than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing better product than me and
I am not ashamed or embarrassed to admit
[SPEAKER_00]: that in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that the next generation,
the younger guys behind me, the younger
[SPEAKER_00]: gals behind me, that's another beautiful
fucking thing to see some ladies in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first jumped in, it was a sausage
fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Maddie and a couple of other ladies
and now there's a lot of women,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of ladies in this industry and I
love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of those ladies and gentlemen
and everything in between, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: surpassed me in grow skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even surpassed me in breeding skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I'm some weed wizard or
some sort of guy at the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a while there, I was one of the
advanced guys, the advanced people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a lot of people are catching up
and they're right on this level and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: no problem admitting it or acknowledging
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that the evolution of the cannabis
legalization, the industry, the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting, the internet, it has made
everybody a much better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has informed and educated consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm off on a good ramble here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys could tell I love this freaking
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not only am I a smoker, I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to grow the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being in the room with the plants,
smelling the plants, smelling the air that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes off of the plants, walking into the
room and just that smell in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's grow has a different smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to different commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all smell differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them smell like the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use some of them smell like the
flowers they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them just smell like the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buildings just have a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the feeling of being in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I love working with the plants,
touching them, seeing them, feeling them,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking across the room and going,
ah, that plant over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these other plants are bright green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a little problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go find out with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go find out what's up with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go walk over to that plant, touch it,
feel it, smell it, see what's wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, identify its problem, correct it,
and then watch that plant grow even better
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after I grow that, I get to give it
to people and they do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get back to my notes because
that's going to get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is getting into my notes that I've
got written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I love ganja?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I fall in love with this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I even smoked ganja, I had uncles,
family members, cousins, people around me
[SPEAKER_00]: who were smoking, loved the smell,
and they always seemed the adults were
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler after they smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up around, I had three rowdy
uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you and miss you every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those three dudes taught me a lot,
a lot of what to do and what not to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were my rowdy uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, some of them were smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were drinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them did other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned not to do those other things by
watching my uncles do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw when some of them drank,
they would get rowdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that when people drank, they would
get rowdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be fights when people drank.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I saw when people smoked ganja,
we all laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People went to Taco Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ate a bunch of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults were better when they smoked
weed, is what I noticed as a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I got older, I was like,
well, I need to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it makes the adults fucking
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the minute I smoked, you know,
I was getting stoned before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hanging out with my uncles and just
being around them, I was catching a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the minute I smoked, I was like,
I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I smoked, I'm trying to
catch myself up on my notes here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up around some savages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that them drinking fucked them
up, made them retarded, actually kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: actually killed the two of my uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should still be here if they did not
drink the way they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they just smoked, they would still be
alive because the uncle that quit
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking, he's still with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the poisons of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my ganja smoker friends, they're still
healthy, looking good, looking young,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw from an early age that some drugs
were bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smoking weed made everybody cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the adults easier to hang out
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They liked the kids better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a parent now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that when I would smoke,
my daughter's 21 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke with my adult daughter now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she was a kid, I'd be like,
I got to spend time with the kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just might not be into it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be playing and I might want to,
we didn't have cell phones as much then,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I might want to be distracted by
something else just because life was
[SPEAKER_00]: distracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would notice I'd go smoke and then go
sit at her little play house or her play
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm making whatever fake Starbucks
Frappuccinos on her little kid playset
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and enjoying it and having a little
tea party with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just get more into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would play more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I saw that happening with me as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults in my life were more fun and it
worked on me as I became a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying, I'm going to get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I love ganja?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it makes things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it make better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes life better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going to therapy for a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, everybody's got some shit to work
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going to therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mentally well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm physically well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spiritually sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I smoke ganja, I feel even
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like putting, it's like putting
little chocolate sprinkles on life or
[SPEAKER_00]: rainbow sprinkles even on life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like putting glitter on boobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes music better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not understand reggae music until I
got super blazed one day and got in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shower and I was grooving and I was like,
fucking understand reggae music right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray, if you're a musician, reggae is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music makes reggae way better for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it, I understood it completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like music when I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also different enhancements make music
better too, but that's not the point
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food is better after you smoke,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go out to dinner and
you go get your favorite meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you smoke a fat joint before you
go, that food's going to taste even
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, it just makes it taste
even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I put on my list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sex is even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get a little distracted and
it takes a minute, which the fuck is wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with sex taking longer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sex is better when you're stoned too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy is one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say laughter is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I smoke a joint,
I just laugh anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comedy and a fat joint, comedy is
better after you smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cartoons, imagine, so this is the
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sitting in front of the TV watching
cartoons, eating a bowl of cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool story, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a joint, do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, those cartoons are way better and
that cereal just tastes way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, something about smoking that
joint, taking a dab, hitting the bong,
[SPEAKER_00]: just makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, like I said a minute ago,
it's like boobs, but with sprinkles,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to meditate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about my spirituality
and my mental clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from a little bit of
meditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be able to close out the outside
world and go inside and really see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: inside yourself or myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I'm able to deal with me
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just close my eyes, shut out everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is what I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can control, I can manage, I can
correct, I can adjust, I can adapt by
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What little things do I need to work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What bothered me today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What made me glitch today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I get hung up on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need to get over?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can deal with that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes can't get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I want to open my eyes and check
my phone or look and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a little bit of a puff of a nice
joint, close my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That IRI meditation comes on so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get there so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already seeing the little bubble zone
that I get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that little meditation, smoke a little
ganja, get in that IRI meditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is as IRI as you could feel right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just makes things feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like sprinkles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like glitter on boobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got a brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deleted a lot of the files on my hard
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up my memory pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that brain injury, I've got some
glitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fixing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been nearly 10 years, which is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be 10 years here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still have some glitches and issues
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're clearing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I would smoke ganja, specific
strains, especially lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would quit the little skips in my brain
from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of described it as there was a
scratch on my CD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are from the CD era,
how old are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a scratch on your CD,
sometimes your CD would just have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: skip, a little skip, a little skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's a record player.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're even older, that record would
skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The record would skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to clean the record or
clean the CD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like smoking ganja cleans my CD
sometimes or cleans my record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two dabs are medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take two dabs, those are medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that gets me right,
that gets my fucking my brain to not skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one, make sure that I won't
skip for a few hours, fixes me,
[SPEAKER_00]: balances me out, balances me out,
gets me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: My third dab, no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like recreational marijuana dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That third one is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That third one is because I like to get
high and consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get me wrong here by saying that
I'm smoking to fix my glitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what the key is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stops the glitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that third, fourth, fifth dab,
those are for enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because I like the effects and the
feelings of consuming five dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to die because it's not any
of the crazy drugs that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to damage my liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might drink an extra Haritos,
which is going to put me at risk for that
[SPEAKER_00]: type two diabetes, but some water and a
good meal, I will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most damage I'm going to do is I'm
going to eat like shit for that day if I
[SPEAKER_00]: take five dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: It fixes my glitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just me, but I've seen cannabis
improve the quality of many people's
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you that it has healed
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that have used cannabis to
overcome problems and symptoms and
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments and diseases, but I can't tell
you too much about that because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of making medical claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say that, but I've seen things
like that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen it improve the quality of
people's lives is what I can technically
[SPEAKER_00]: legally say without any sort of
ramifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes people's lives better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a dispensary in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some friends of mine and I shout out to
the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a dispensary in downtown Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would come in and I had a large
demographic of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 year old dudes that would run into the
dispensary and run out and people would
[SPEAKER_00]: say, what's wrong with that guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say he's got a heart condition
that if he doesn't consume cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: his heart rate starts going all wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis helps his heart rate stay in
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see what people's conditions
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs in, he runs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still buys cannabis to improve the
quality of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little tiny old lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just call her Carol.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was all hunched over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had a plethora of medical problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was on a mountain of medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came to my dispensary looking for some
type of relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had never smoked cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before a lot of the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no rules at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were kind of developing the rules as
this was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we didn't have any rules,
I grabbed her a chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her husband was with her so she was safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put this in line, give her a
disclaimer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carol had her husband with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was safe and he approved of what we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed the chair and I said,
I really think from your description,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking this product and I grabbed,
I think it was chocolate chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my brain serves me correctly,
I said, I think you want to smoke some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this chocolate chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, sweetheart, I've never
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we sat down and I packed a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed her how to pack a bowl of
chocolate chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed her how to light it from the top
and not the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we saw that one dude do on that TV
show that made them look like a head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed her how to take one good smoke
out of that bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap it out with her or put it out with
their lighter and set it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed her how to inhale it,
exhale it smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then her husband and I sat there with
her for a few minutes and I watched the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms of her pain and her anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was bent over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was hunched over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was sad and she was scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she took an inhale and she blew it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could watch her shoulders just
drop from the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stress blew out when she exhaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her neck went up a little bit and her
curiosity of life went back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched that lady enjoy life just with
one puff of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, this is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is doing something for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I gave her multiple grams of
different kinds of flowers to take home
[SPEAKER_00]: with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that permission from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could give those products away because
this was going to help this lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave her like probably seven or eight
different grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told her, go home and try these all
at different times and just take one puff
[SPEAKER_00]: and see which one does your mind,
your body, your spirit the best that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll start providing that for
you on a very regular and cost-effective
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see this lady over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying she was hunched and she was
folded over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a foot shorter than she should
have been because her confidence in life,
[SPEAKER_00]: her confidence in herself had vanished
because of her illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pain was taking over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was becoming afraid of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was becoming depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She couldn't go out and function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was becoming a hermit, which was
compounding all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the results of that, I just
stuttered so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually stutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results of this were she was hunched
over like the freaking hunchback of Notre
[SPEAKER_00]: Dame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when she started smoking, it gave her
back her confidence, her enjoyment,
[SPEAKER_00]: her self-esteem, her physical pain went
away, which made her smile, which made her
[SPEAKER_00]: and her husband get along better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one person out of probably a
thousand people that came to my
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just guessing a thousand people that
came to my dispensary that I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with and help and improve the
quality of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't fall in love with
something, and then I was growing that
[SPEAKER_00]: product, I was working with the plants and
feeling the vibration, the love,
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy from the plants, I got to grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to trim them, dry them and
cure them, and then take them downstairs
[SPEAKER_00]: and give them to Carol and watch her life
get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how couldn't you fall in love and
enjoy that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a full feeling, fulfilling
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing but love and care and
compassion and positivity in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no negativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The negativity and downside was all
Babylon legal ramifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were closed because we were illegally
zoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tried to find us and do all
kinds of dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I got to see young people,
old people and everything in between and
[SPEAKER_00]: prove the quality of their life by
consuming a product that my friends and I
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated in a facility upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was how can you not love seeing
people feel better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were sick, they were sad,
they were scared, and now they enjoy life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pop in every week to remind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a burn victim that came to the
dispensary and he was toasted from head to
[SPEAKER_00]: toe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked like you were thinking,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people, they were afraid of him
because of his appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to overcome a little bit of,
it might have been fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was, but I had to
shake this man's hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to shake this burned victim's hand
and look him in the eye and make friends
[SPEAKER_00]: with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was a firefighter that got
burned up really badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to help him and develop a
relationship with this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were afraid of him when he first
came in and he was afraid of us when he
[SPEAKER_00]: first came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a few visits, that guy was our
friend and we respected each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: took good care of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember a lot of those people that
came to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have a spot within me still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I still carry that energy as
I'm breeding, as I'm growing, as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking that is still in me and that is
still out there in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people still remember me as the guy
that showed them how to use cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge role to play on both
sides of that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next note is unity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen a bunch of people smoke
and get mad at each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've never taken a dab and been like,
Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken a shot of tequila and I don't
know what they put in tequila,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jägermeister.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have it, but there's a surprise
in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be in the first shot or the 17th
shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never know who's going to get it
either, but you could take a shot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Jägermeister.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you set that shot glass
down on the table, you just pick somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have decided, fuck you,
fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mom, your mom's dog, fuck your uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know why, but we have to
fight now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in tequila.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in Jägermeister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, whiskey doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiskey has a coyote arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coyote arm is when you take a shot and
your arm flies up in the air and you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: woo, that's coyote arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you never get that out of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis doesn't have coyote arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis doesn't have fist fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cannabis doesn't have shit talking in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cannabis has unity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke some dabs, you smoke a joint and
everybody you just smoked with is now some
[SPEAKER_00]: of your best friends forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when that buzz wears off,
you're still going to be friends forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the magical effect is,
but I've never smoked a joint or smoked a
[SPEAKER_00]: dab and been like, let's go beat somebody
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been like, man, I've been being a
dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to smoke a joint for like an hour
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some people and get some snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the unity, the unity in cannabis,
I've smoked with people of every color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, white people, black people,
brown people, yellow people, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, ever brown people, whatever
other color there are, I've smoked with
[SPEAKER_00]: those people and we all enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no racism in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every color of people loves to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people who's, uh,
just their brain chemistry and their
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality, they shouldn't smoke,
but they'll learn that and they won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll just have a bad experience on
their own and they won't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, every race, every religion,
um, everybody on the planet can enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to discriminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come smoke, whatever religion you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could smoke a joint and we could
solve some problems together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your religion and your religion don't
get along, smoke that joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll be peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wrote, uh, age, sex, location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, well, I do care if you're old
enough, like you got to be an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: To smoke with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not smoking with no babies or nothing,
but if you're old enough to smoke and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, if you show up with some weed,
I'll smoke with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't care if you're male,
female, um, I'm adjusting to being,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, more comfortable smoking with people
that are in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm learning about trans people and
becoming more comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll smoke with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trans, I don't care where you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more fun to smoke in weird fucking
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, stoners know the coolest places to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out of the top of my head in the
comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let me know your favorite place to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's like a creative place to smoke,
a weird place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's a notable place that you have or
like to smoke and consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave that in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to reading your comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I wrote everyone loves to
smoke the thugs, the Goths, the hippies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rastas, the moms, the doctors,
the lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes to smoke weed,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, but Babylon, everybody,
but law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of them smoke too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody loves to smoke ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could you not?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, how did I fall in
love with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, first of all, by smoking it and
feeling better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, I got to grow cannabis
and then being around the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: watching them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow from a seed all the way to a
smokable product by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need any intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, me smoking that product, I grew as
such a fulfilling experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing it was a ritual and a meditation
and its own smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a ritual and a meditation and its
own sharing that with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching you enjoy it is a whole nother
meditation and ritual and its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love every step of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people find growing cannabis to
be daunting and to be a task and to be
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could grow weed all day and not do any
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love producing and cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It and then I get to breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my role in the community is making new
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm creating new cultivars and new
genetics for recreational and medical
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and mostly what I'm doing is creating
shit that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just so happens that you guys
like what I'm making.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm making an album and I'm
like, this is how my heart felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the music that I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you love it, you love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily I've got a good eye or ear or
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: For growing because you guys really seem
to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my love for the plant,
uh, shows and how I grow and how I breed,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, how I come on here every week and give
you 30 minutes of my time, just talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about ganja for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I do have a Patreon channel,
but without the patron, I would still do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my love reflects for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it developed by, uh, smoking and
enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember smoking with my high school
bros, Chris and Shannon and Randy and Andy
[SPEAKER_00]: and Greg and Todd didn't smoke much,
but he hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm sure I miss Dave and Brandon and
there's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to miss anybody,
but that was my high school crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorite memories are just in
the car, smoking with those boys or
[SPEAKER_00]: driving around, trying to find weed to
smoke with those boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part of the adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then you guys are spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all you new smokers are spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then we had to drive around and just
hope that one of the buddies would page us
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pager, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd go to the Burger King and Burger
King had a payphone and you'd page them
[SPEAKER_00]: and put in your pager number or your cell
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even have cell phones as a
pager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you put in the Burger King payphone
number and hang out by the phone and hope
[SPEAKER_00]: your buddy calls you on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, or just drive around and hopefully
we'd see one of our weed dealer friends
[SPEAKER_00]: driving around town or maybe he's at the
park or who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things were so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you run out of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go to the fucking store down the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 20 stores within five minutes of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go buy weed and concentrates or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't even remember where I was in
this part of the chat, but, but part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: love for this plant developed just around
finding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it sounds like a pain in the
ass driving around looking for weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was part of the mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just driving around, trying to find it and
then finding somewhere safe to smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then figuring out what you're going to
do after you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of shenanigans do we get into?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that shenanigans happened,
you and your friends never forgot about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some blank shit you didn't
remember, but you always laughed about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that time that Chris did this and
then fell off of this into the pool and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, just some random shit you'll
always remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is always a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If respected, you could disrespect it and
you could try to get too high and you
[SPEAKER_00]: will, you'll get the spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get the throw ups or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could definitely, if you try to do
something silly, this is where we make
[SPEAKER_00]: that adult disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're all fucked up and don't operate
heavy machinery, don't do dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause cannabis will make you respect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you respect this plant and love the
plant, it will love you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're a recreational consumer,
whether you're a medical consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're a spiritual cannabis
consumer, that's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I'm making that one my own term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's medical, there's recreational,
and now there is spiritual cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, whichever one you're doing it
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just doing it just because you
like to smoke weed and get high,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, luckily I got
interrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still be rambling about why I love
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for me to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have made my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been consuming cannabis since I was
a youngster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one time I got to give my
uncles another shout out, then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: finish this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one time being in the back of
my uncle Eric's Chevy El Camino with a
[SPEAKER_00]: camper shell on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Eric and uncle Ron, both of them
have passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss you boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were on our way to a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were listening to the Metallica black
album.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smoke came to the back of that car
and I got so stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think I've been a pothead since then
and they didn't even know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my uncles,
Ron and Eric, uh, for setting me on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right path and giving me the right idea
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw them do a lot of other things and I
saw that gun shot was the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always loved the smell of it from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I loved being around those guys when
they smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw it everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and I learned to recognize that I
could smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew, so I think I was a stoner
before I even was a stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm grateful that I found this
niche without this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even, we'll, we'll guess,
we'll speculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll anticipate where I would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably be a failed musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would probably be working at a
bowling alley or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably be working at guitar center,
trying to sling drums or some shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what would have happened
without cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got nothing but love, gratitude,
and respect for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my dude, lucky bowl packer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a lucky bowl packer because you
