[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.

[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today was a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot of podcasting and a lot of
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a couple of other podcasts
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Dude Grow Show,
hung out with Scotty Real and Guru,
[SPEAKER_00]: and James Bean earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a few dabs on that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a few dabs throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dabbing a lot of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dabbing Crescendo Live Batter
from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dabbing some Kim Brulay from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I've got a little bit of
the Bananas Foster from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I seem heavily medicated
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long podcasting day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 95 for part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really hot day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it has cooled off quite a bit
and it is time to do a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the show where we do
shout outs to the members of the 710 Club.

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be

[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big thanks and big shout out
to everybody who supports the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a lot of great questions for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question on today's podcast goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, I'll be in the live again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought I'd try my luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find this information anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're starting off by saying
they found me through my Instagram live
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Monday around seven 10 PM mountain
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jump on Instagram live and I hang out
with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a bunch of dabs and I ramble for
about a solid hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Instagram gives you one full hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there until they cut me off most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to field all of the questions that
come up in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no way of predicting what may come
up in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ask a question in the chat,
I'll kind of answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's something I want to ramble on and
rant on, I'll get going for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those mini rants turn into
podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to connect with me and
hang out Mondays on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check us out there on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do leave the videos up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the older videos are up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them got deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit happens with Instagram, but that's
why we use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this listener was checking out the
Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to jump in again on another
Monday and try to get their question
[SPEAKER_00]: answered, but have no fear because I'm
going to read your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm growing in cocoa,
a four by four Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just filled the net was going to flip to
flower tomorrow, but I noticed powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew on the lower and some of the other
leaves I stripped and the lower big fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, I will use a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They listed the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, do I wait or do I begin
flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so grateful for any help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fully understand that you are busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that if you've got
powdery mildew and you were considering
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping to flower, I would wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait until that problem is under
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the, the issue at hand corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the reason causing the issue
corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is incorrect in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VPD is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not evacuating humidity quickly
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to get more airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to remove humidity from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to solve the problem and also
treat the plants at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can keep spraying the plants with shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can keep putting band-aids on the
plants, but they will keep getting powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't correct the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall solution is correct the
room, then correct the plants or treat
[SPEAKER_00]: both at the same time, solve the problem,
then go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put these plants into flower and
they've got powdery mildew, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powdery mildew will get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your options for treating that
powdery mildew will get minimized as time
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you got bud set, junkier buds,
you cannot start doing different things
[SPEAKER_00]: for those powdery mildew problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got way off course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get buds, we can't spray with some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to get buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to solve the problem,
treat the plants, rid the room of the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew, then put the healthy clean
plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not include your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know who to thank for this
great message, but I hope I gave you some
[SPEAKER_00]: good grow advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you have solved your powdery
mildew problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things you can do for
the powdery mildew now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that double nickel and CES are
great products for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great fungicides out
there that will solve that problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, the main thing right now is
to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is causing that powdery mildew in the
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could spray the plants all day,
but if we don't take care of the issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great message here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Tyler.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Tyler?
[SPEAKER_00]: Been talking to you on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes, man, I'm a big fan of
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of yours as well,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I really hope to slab dab with
you one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those slab dabs are killing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go through phases?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a side note, a good rant,
a Rasta Jeff moment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go through phases where you can
smoke all of the dabs and you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: high?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go through phases where you
can just open the jar and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: obliterated?
[SPEAKER_00]: This week has been one of the weeks where
I take a dab and every dab has made me go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, today I smoked nearly three
grams of concentrates today, but it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is not a normal day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has been one of the phases where
I just take a fat dab and my body's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you're high, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should sit down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm a cheap date lately,
which is always nice because on those
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks when I smoke and smoke and smoke and
nothing happens, I feel like I just burn
[SPEAKER_00]: through the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets quite expensive, a little bit
spendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But slab dab, bro, I'm smoking these
diamonds in this batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets expensive throwing down slab
dabs, but if you're down, I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm getting older, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs are going to blow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know where the hot hospital is if we
go too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the one strain you would recommend
of a fan of yours to buy so I can keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother to remember you by?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, am I dying and nobody told me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you need something to remember me
by?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just when you say it like that,
it's just like, you make me feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking dying and nobody told me yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know that I don't know,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: What one strain would I recommend to
remember me by to grow a mother plant out
[SPEAKER_00]: of?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they recommend orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'd like to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some mothers from my DGC free
seed pack that mean more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mean more to me than the $200 packs I
have purchased, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a good sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the big stony indicas,
greasy buds that press into terpy rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: are more important than profile of the
high to me, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you prefer greasy buds with terpy rosin
over the profile of the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, keep on rocking,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a real cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a one bad motherfucker yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to recommend here for
somebody that wants to remember me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said stony indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I breed is more of a real
head racy sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the orangegasm may be a really
good thing to remember me by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody made me a nice plaque,
sent me a real nice letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had an orangegasm package in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, orangegasm has been the hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm has been the best seller out of
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photos have been fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be a good one to remember me
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course there is lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my name on the damn package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells funny and it will kick your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lemon jeffery, you know, but stony
indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say maybe morning dew since you
want that indica, that indica funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said stony profile more
important than the high terpy rosin more
[SPEAKER_00]: important than the profile of the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you're going to get that skunky
funkiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also stony indica, I think morning dew
may be the one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want the oranges, go for the,
the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more of a skunky stony thing,
that's when I would say go for the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two of the three,
cause I put lemon jeffery in there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, it really sounds like I'm dying
and nobody told me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's on my mind now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the three strains I would
recommend for you, Tyler.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, orangegasm because it's just been a
hit lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been my number one seller,
which means you guys love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means I'm obviously in love with it,
which means it's a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to keep getting made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon jeffery has got my name in it
because I really love that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limonene is beautiful for me,
but you prefer something more indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm going to say morning dew
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Tyler, I hope I answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a big thank you for the Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to hearing from you again in
the Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I answer a lot of messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to get in touch with me is
through Patreon, patreon.com forward slash
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the info you need is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to answer all of those Patreon
messages on at least a bi weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got another great message here from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey my friend, thanks for
answering about my herbs now dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention an herbs dryer machine on
the podcast before I said that I may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be a fan of it when I said that I didn't
think I would like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people sent me messages saying,
bro, you should really try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may stand corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used it myself, so I can't
endorse it, but I've gotten a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: positive reviews and nobody has told me
that they do not like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm listening to you
and Mike right now on eight 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020, the freestyle shows like these are
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to tell you, I appreciate
you helping me get through work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know exactly how that feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to run commercial cultivation
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the days would just freaking
drag on and I would put Joe Rogan in my
[SPEAKER_00]: ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put the dude grows crew in my ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys would make the day go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I'm able to do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously thank you for the Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you always talk about wondering
what people do, what people do that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can listen to this podcast as they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing all day, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm a professional powder,
coder, and wet painter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I listened to your podcast while I
paint military vehicle parts, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: medical equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what powder coating is my uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna be a trucker.
But yeah, John, thank you for being a part
of my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, John, now love you,
Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my family, Marc grandma too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, grandma, the rest of peace,
grandma shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them worked at a place in
California where they did powder coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky enough to get some bike parts,
bike parts, powder coated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that three times fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some bike parts powder coated and my
bike looked fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had solar, black handlebars,
solar, black forks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody in town knew what was up with my
powder coated handlebars and forks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, so I know what powder coating is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be fun painting military
vehicles and medical equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you get a lot of quality paint,
a lot of fun experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just paint the same random shit
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit rambling and focus on
the message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I love what you are
doing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am starting a podcast now to help
spread content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interviewing master growers who
run facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also interviewing breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do more interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I cut people off and I'm going
to get more people on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you it will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple obstacles in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're clearing those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I aspire to be as big in the
podcast world as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if I get a big following,
I can have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, feels weird when you say get as big in
the podcast world as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a little show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I pop up in the top 100 on
Stitcher and the education category.
I'm just a little show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a normal dude doing my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A one-man production here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that you think it's a
giant thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay humble and realize it's just
a guy in a microphone doing what I meant
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for getting me on your podcast,
I've got a better idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means this, I'm not trying to
sound egotistical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really the way that I think it
would work for both of us marketing wise,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of me going on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many people know of your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: New shows, not a big exposure,
not a big exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows about you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you want to be as big as my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, come on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about your show on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expose yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expose yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your clothes on, expose your show to
my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way people can hear you on my
show and my audience will hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go on your show, uh, chances are,
and this is where it sounds egotistical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are your small new audience knows
of my bigger show already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get more benefit if you
come here and we'll spread you to a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a larger catapult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can post the episode where
you're on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you permission to post that
episode on your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get Ross to Jeff on your feed,
have your interview up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get free content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a whole new episode for your feed
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we call it a swap cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both get a show out of our time works
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll both get exposure, but I think
that's the way to do it is get you up here
[SPEAKER_00]: on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a little intro for it,
put the music on it and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it look real killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but no offense to your show or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that marketing wise,
that is probably the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, strategy is to have you come be on the
show via zoom, uh, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think I hope that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, by the way, I'm going to mention the
name of your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the show is called talking buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to check that out for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says first episode wasn't great
quality, but it is all on the platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever bored and want to check it
out, you guys, there's a new podcast out
[SPEAKER_00]: there called talking buds with a Z B U D Z
it's on all of the platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it's poor quality, but you know,
what's cool about a poor quality first
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is means you got fucking plenty of
room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put out that fucking number 10 on
the first episode, you wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to keep putting out fucking
tens and it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out like solid eights, nines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try for tens, but tens are, I think tens
are fucking that's, that's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out eights and nines every week,
twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a seven, I rerecord it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you won't get a seven,
but don't be upset with yourself about
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out a sub par first episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you got nowhere to go, but up from
there, I'm going to get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, uh, but I'm trying to help get
rid of the stigma from cannabis and you
[SPEAKER_00]: and my white Mike have helped push me to
do my part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an iry day, homie, much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for rambling, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never be sorry for rambling in an email to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of the Kings as I think the cool
kids now say I'm the CEO of rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be the CEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever be shy to ramble to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcasting is just people talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes the side tangents are where
the fucking gold comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would pretty much, I don't know if
I'm going to be able to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do appreciate your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you for starting a podcast and
thank you for acknowledging that Mike and
[SPEAKER_00]: I were a big inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, do you hear that bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: We helped this guy get inspired to start a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm going to leave this note here on
the side of the table and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: check out talking buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe I'll give you an episode or two
to get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, bro, get a couple
episodes under your belt, uh, in the feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three to five episodes have
something going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll listen to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have some content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll know about you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just do like a 20 minute little
talk, maybe 30 minutes or so talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk about your show or pitch each
other real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll send you on your merry way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll post it on both of our
feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you got a couple of episodes going
up, we could check them out and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you gotta, you gotta have
something for me to check out before I
[SPEAKER_00]: could really fully endorse you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may get crazy to bring you on the
show and you're just completely crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact me again, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check out your show and we will get
our new friend from, uh, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking buds podcast on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let him interview me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll interview him at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll tag team the whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the message, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you include a name here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose name do you want me to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't put a name here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just once again, shout out to the
talking buds podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be on the show in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could both practice interviewing people
on that episode and get a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another episode, another
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a whole nother episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a person who calls
themselves monkey with a U and it goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, please note, let me make
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well now he just said not to mention
his identity, but, uh, bro, your name is
[SPEAKER_00]: monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longtime fan of who a long time fan who
finally got the opportunity to purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in week five, a flower with the golden
goat S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have noticed many, many of the
leaves have a bud growing from the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got golden goat S ones that is a
golden goat, feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that he has got, uh, is it leaves
or buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure which ones I've seen both
of the leaves have a bud growing from the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say your bud is coming up here and
you've got a leaf coming out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's where it spreads out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the finger leaf right about the
Palm, but facing up, there's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: nugget farming, just one calyx farming
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know a common denominator of
when and why that happens, but let's keep
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I was curious if this was a
mutation that you had seen commonly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen this in the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this inject the ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this in a few other strains,
mostly a sativa tropical type varietals is
[SPEAKER_00]: where I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been growing her organically
using down to earth four four four for veg
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dr. Earth three nine four flower girl
during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are quite close to the lights as I am
very limited in a very limited height
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured it could easily be a stress
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast and incredible work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to finally try what I've
heard so much about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's weird if you've got multiple
phenotypes doing that, uh, because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: something happening in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was just one plant, I would say
that's a total anomaly in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got multiple plants doing it in
your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think the reason for a plant
to spit out extra buds like that is
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's super happy with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, bro, I'm so happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those parts of the plant that it's making
are it's a reproductive organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, so happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so horny and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make more sex organs on
different parts, just so I can get even
[SPEAKER_00]: hornier and have more happy parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plan is so happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I've got so much light,
so much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is dialed in so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to make more buds for this
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trying to give you more flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's got so much energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't know where to put those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it popped up right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be more of a scientific answer
that I'm unaware of, but from what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen this happen, it is always tropical
sativa varietal plants that were really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got happy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So monkey, I want to thank you for the
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was sent a little bit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see how this crop is doing,
how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, send me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, send me an update on those golden goat
S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to, likes to know how that went.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get my voice together,
get my thoughts together, and we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to read another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from, I don't know if they
want their name set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got their full name here at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, my name is Boosie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a good name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use my name and this entire
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a question about types of
pollen or outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a good pollen question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding questions are some of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll share a lot, but I keep some to
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it's hard to explain, but I will
try my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have a strawberry banana female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far I follow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a strawberry eclair female.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you like strawberry flavored plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like strawberry banana, strawberry
eclair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like shit I could get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I plan on selfing each one to have
seeds to store for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow you so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take pollen from the bubblegum cut
and add it to the eclair cut with the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenol outcomes very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would add pollen in the opposite
eclair to bubblegum, it seems like a silly
[SPEAKER_00]: question, but I would like to hear your
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there will be variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it just depends on the dominance
of the genetics that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of those plants have grandparents
or both those plants have parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are going to be grandparents of your
new offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your strawberry eclair and your
strawberry banana have different,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a different, at least one
different parent and there are possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the word strawberry and both of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume there's one common
parent and then two different parents in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different phenotypes of those plants
are going to show different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you breed to them, you may see,
so we took the grandparents, the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents, we made the new parents,
we crossed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see these grandparents come up in
some phenotypes depending on the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all depends on which grandpa and
which grandma was more dominant and which
[SPEAKER_00]: mommy and which daddy was more dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the opportunity to see this
plant and this plant and these two plants
[SPEAKER_00]: on the family tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see mommy and you can see
mommy's grandparents and you can see daddy
[SPEAKER_00]: and daddy's grandparents coming through
some of those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about which plant had the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all, it's a gamble and a dice roll of
which way those genetics are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will see varying phenotypes
depending on just how those genetics land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a gamble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like putting up a chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get so many attribute points on this
chart and they're going to fall in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a lot of common things,
but then you may see on one side,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may see a grandfather trait really
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other one, you could see the
grandmother trait very heavily,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you may not see any of those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there will be variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, seems like a silly question,
but I'd like to hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a silly question at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when people think about breeding
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of my favorite questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just, you've taken one ingredient
and another ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just, if you mix things,
different ways, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: different outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the male, one way you'll get
different resistance, possibly a different
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, maybe different aromas,
just because that's what the male does to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cross or at least the pollen donor
will do to the cross and you'll unlock
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive traits and traits from the
parents and grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I keep saying, so you will see
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on a random note, my buddy Rasta
Dave and his family came to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Rasta Dave?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a beautiful family.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little kids are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your wife was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice and fun to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds weird, but Dave was there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not how that sounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said I'd like to say thank you a lot,
sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And job blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are from Missouri and everything is new
and exciting here since we went medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a cool little family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did get to meet up, hung out in a
parking lot for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to share some love, a bunch of dread
heads in a parking lot, little tiny kids
[SPEAKER_00]: with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole family was dreads except mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said she used to have dreads,
but she'll get them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure one day she'll have dreads again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the dreadlock family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came and hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to our friend, Boosie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more breeding questions,
let me know something else I want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to preserve these,
I would do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do one plant for a reversal at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have two males in the same room in
the same house at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have the breeding project you
think you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reverse either Betty Claire or the
strawberry other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that what you said?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read any more strawberry banana and
strawberry Eau Claire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one, reverse it, pollinate both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pollinate both at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll both be in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the male plant in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just knock it back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate both plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do the opposite next time,
but do them at separate times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a clear idea of which is who
the baby daddy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always want to know who the baby daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have to take these plants
to Maury and figure out what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to meeting you the next
time the dead crew comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope things go well for you out there in
Missouri as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck on the new medical cannabis
venture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have time for one more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we've got time for one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a screenshot on my phone that I
wanted to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, who's this come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their names set
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep that private.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says great show, great genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way to start a message to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I love listening to your show
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a quick breeding question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the breeding questions says after
pollinating seeds are starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you change the nutrients or the
lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you should start up veg newts
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to know if there's any truth
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one could keep, could keep me talking
for quite a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a crop that is seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this point in time, we are not
growing for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want buds with big beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to have big, beautiful flowers
and trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're growing for at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grower is growing for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now abandoned the idea of seedless
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going seeded, but it's a whole new
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, yes, I do recommend
changing the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to focus a little bit more on
growth and not buds and trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not making big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would replace the bed, the flowering
nutrients and I would put a vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing the cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do the bud boosters like you would
normally do instead of doing a bud
[SPEAKER_00]: booster, add amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids are good building blocks for
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need some Kalamag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to keep that nitrogen
going to keep the plants with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, a lot of vigor and a lot of
momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they may want to go a little bit
longer than you normally flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start flushing as early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to worry as much about
flushing because we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume these flowers anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get the seeds out of
there, it's mostly just dust and trash
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do change the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue with the vegetative newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't add bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of increase the Kalamag based on
what I see the plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I pay a lot of attention to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of, they're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to treat them like a pregnant
lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their needs are going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn how to identify those
needs by watching the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for lighting, there are a few things
you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an experienced grower and you
know what to watch for, you can change the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about this a lot,
but here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come down this path with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it for the last three weeks of a
seeded crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn your lights back on 18 and
six for the last little bit of a seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, and it will help those seeds bulk up
and speed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this earlier than I'm recommending
because I'm very experienced with my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how they're going to respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said before, we're not growing
for pretty buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not growing for buds,
if your goal is seeds, you can turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: time after pollination has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you see seeds forming, the calyxes
are swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the timer back to 18, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will begin to revege in about
15 days, 17 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see revegetative growth happening
on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be alarmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't care about the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We care about the seeds tucked inside of
those buds, that extra light, those extra
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, that extra PPFD, that extra
energy is going to make the seeds grow
[SPEAKER_00]: with more vigor, more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get harder, faster, and they'll be
done sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be more healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this from experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I speed up seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you can speed them up by
putting the timer back to 18, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it once you see the seeds are
building up and getting kind of chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it is safe to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them on 18, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start seeing the seeds
poking out of the calyxes on the tips of
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds, pull a couple of them off and
give them a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they hollow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they crunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you squeeze them, does juice come
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that green thing come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a little white embryo come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: See what's inside of that seed and you'll
know when they are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need to dig deeper into the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the outer seeds aren't the best
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those get roasted by the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you touched them or something,
you killed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a seed from the inside of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it's nice and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when it is time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can change the light cycle back to
18, six at the end of the flowering period
