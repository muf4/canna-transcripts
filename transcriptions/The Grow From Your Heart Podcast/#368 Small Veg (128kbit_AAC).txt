[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 368 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need fresh genetics for your
garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Company, and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I am smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Screamin'
Watermelon from our friends at Viola
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff has a really nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dab it too hot, you totally kill
that sweet watermelon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go in nice and cool, it has a sweet
watermelon, Jolly Rancher sort of flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label here says it is 94.5% THC-A and
0% CBD or CBG for a total of 82.88% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty impressive lab test for
something with so much flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the Screamin'
Watermelon from Viola Extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also big shout out to my friends at
the Colorado Cannabis Exchange for taking
[SPEAKER_00]: good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's work on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have been following along with
my long leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably four, maybe six inches
tall by now, and that is what I call small
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a podcast about the small
vegetative phase of growing your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the vegetative phase of
growing cannabis is often the most
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked phase of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think they need to invest all of
their time, energy, and money on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very important, but I like to
believe that you can't build a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: building without a solid foundation,
and that foundation starts in the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we get these plants to the
flowering room, we need them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them to be robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them the shape we want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them the structure we want them,
and we need them pest and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main focus during the small vegetative
stage is to develop a strong root system
[SPEAKER_00]: for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get those roots thick and
busting out of that pot before I
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant them into their forever homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second goal is to keep these plants
pest and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I'm working from seeds,
I'm also paying attention for issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations, problems, whatever a seedling
may show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seedling has a ton of options that can
occur through the entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay special attention to your
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing from clones,
you should know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main focus during the small
vegetative phase is developing a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second priority is maintaining clean,
healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any bugs, and I don't need
any pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my third priority if I'm growing from
seeds, I want to pay close attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: those seedlings, and I want to keep my eye
out for any weird mutations or weird
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if things go right, we are only going
to spend two to four weeks in these small
[SPEAKER_00]: pots in our small veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, this phase is equally
as important as the flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to treat every step of the grow
process as an important process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to focus on that flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get excited around week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get super pumped up at week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week six, you're just ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week seven and eight, you can't wait to
cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week nine, you're in there every single
day taking pictures, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, hoping you can cut them down today
or tomorrow, just trying to be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we put that much energy into the
starting phase of our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're not as pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to show for it,
but it is just as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get a little deeper into this
small veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this small veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes it small veg is my plants are
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what makes it veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg is the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants are triggered by the light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have enough light, they will not
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we reduce the light to approximately
12 hours on and 12 hours off every day,
[SPEAKER_00]: that triggers our plants to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that the fall is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start doing their end of season
business, which is producing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts that we call buds are the
cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are dried flower tops from a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is induced by changing the light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we manipulate that light cycle,
we are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we are using small pots and have
small plants, once again, we are back to
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about these
light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of options for light
cycles in our veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I have experienced, the most
common and most popular veg light schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: is 18 hours on and 16 hours off in a daily
24 hour cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go 24 hours on and zero hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen great success with two hours
of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 22 hours on and two hours off
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility, in a mother room
and in a veg room, I am known to do 20
[SPEAKER_00]: hours on and four hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I mentioned the 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really close to what nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is the 16 on and eight hours
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these have their advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they all have their disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the advantage of 24 hours and zero
hours of darkness?
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours of light means your plants are
getting 24 hours of light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually recommend a 24 hour on cycle
only for clones and tiny plants or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have mother plants that if
they get root bound or if they don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough light or if they don't get the
proper energy, they will decide to auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower on you over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep those plants under 24 hours
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does prevent them from flipping
themselves into flower because of another
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time I would not recommend
a 24 hour light cycle unless you are
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting clones or you're trying to re-veg
or perhaps you've got a mother plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: gets temperamental and wants to try to
auto flower on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 20 on and four off for a
commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a little bit of dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every living thing likes a little
bit of dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think roots develop in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plants like a little rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that is four hours of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not being sucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one light, you're saving a
little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 50 lights, you are saving a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 200 light hours that you are not
running right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 200,000 watt light hours that you
don't have to pay for if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 hours on, four hours off is always
great for a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep your mother plants in that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep your small veg in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep your large veg in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I put the clones in that same room
underneath the T5 light in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just a little bit of light in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really bother the rest of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That T5 doesn't do much in a giant veg
room in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I always like to mention the downside
of what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much of a downside to a 20 on
and four off cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess really the only downside is that
you are always running lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get four hours of darkness
compared to my next method, which is an 18
[SPEAKER_00]: on and six hour off every day cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers prefer this because it is
closer to the natural cycles of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is closer to the natural rhythms of the
sun outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little closer to the natural
circadian rhythm that our plants would be
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to in their normal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just feels a little more natural in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pros to an 18-6 cycle is it feels
pretty natural to you and the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also saves you quite a bit of
electricity having a six hour night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is six hours that you don't have your
lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's six hours you don't have to cool
the room as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply that by however many lights
you've got and you start saving more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think the plants really enjoy a
nice six hour nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a lot of productivity from
that six hour nap that the plants get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our next option is a 16 and eight
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very similar to the 18-6,
but some plants will show you some
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants may try to flower under that
16-8 cycle if they get root bound,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they become nutrient deficient,
if there are any environmental factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that stress those plants, they may decide
to flower on you underneath that 16 and
[SPEAKER_00]: eight light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what part of the globe your
plants originate from, they may have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me explain the critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critical period is the amount of dark
hours a plant needs to induce its
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will flower with a 14 hour
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will flower with a 10 hour
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we go for that 12 on 12 off is
it's right in the middle and it seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: work well with most of the plants that we
have bred for our indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since some plants come from north of
the equator and some plants come from
[SPEAKER_00]: south of the equator, we do have different
flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In tropical areas, those plants can flower
for much longer because they're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get snowed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in those areas, we don't get as
drastic of a day and night cycle change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be as much as one hour
difference between your summer and your
[SPEAKER_00]: winter day period.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other areas, we get winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get dumped on and we get long dark
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plants have evolved and adapted and
climatized themselves to those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have bred with those plants and
we've created hybrids and brought them
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, some of our plants will flower
with a 10 hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, some of our plants will flower
with a 12 hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have established that 12 on and 12 off
seems to work really well for most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that we have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to prevent them from flowering early,
we like to use an extended light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we put them on 16 hours on at
a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we know they're not going to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go that 18 hours because why not
give them two more full hours of energy
[SPEAKER_00]: every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one desired nutrient
from our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one desired factor for
growth from our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not give it that extra two hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in my mind, I say why not give it that
full 20 hours every day so that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum growth and give our plants a four
hour nap every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another reason I like the 20 on and
four off is I find that when I move my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into the flowering room and I take
them from a 20 hour day to a 12 hour day,
[SPEAKER_00]: they induce flowering very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other facilities where I'm running
shorter veg periods, I notice they take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little longer for the plants to start
popping up bud set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little preflowers, the little pistils
don't start popping up as early as if I
[SPEAKER_00]: were to run those plants on a long day
cycle and then kick that 12, 12 right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the plants go, oh shit,
it is time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really had a reduction in
daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I do 20 on and four off in
my veg and mom area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm running, sometimes I've got
50 or 75 different cultivars in a mom
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've really got to keep things happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that the 20 on and four off
prevents anything from auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it really triggers that
flowering when I put them into the 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the basic veg schedules I
would recommend 24, 20 and four,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 and six, or 16 and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go much lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have the desired robust
vegetative growth that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you may get plants that decide to
flower before you're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we know how long to leave the
light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about what kind of light to
put these plants under.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to throw these small plants
under the Gavita lights right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may crisp them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may roast them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to start my small plants under
smaller lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most situations, I think a T5 would
work for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most commercial environments,
I use the three foot long T5 fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're three feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have eight bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you can fit quite a few small
veg plants under those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I like to set
up a two tiered veg system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a Uline rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put plants on the bottom shelf of that
Uline rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang a light underneath the top shelf to
light those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got that top shelf freed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put plants up there and I hang a light
from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got two layers of plants and I'm
maximizing my space by using a two tiered
[SPEAKER_00]: veg system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a T5 fixture for the plants
on the bottom shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the plants on the top shelf,
I either use a Gavita or a metal halide,
[SPEAKER_00]: either somewhere between a four and a
thousand watt, depending on my space,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on my environment, depending on
how far from those plants I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those small veg plants start off on
the bottom shelf under the T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as I transplant, I move them up to
the top shelf and they go underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those are Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends again on my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I really find the T5s to be cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're efficient and I think they
do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to invest a little more money
on a better light, I have seen great
[SPEAKER_00]: success vegging underneath LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small plants really love LED lights and
also those LED lights don't produce much
[SPEAKER_00]: heat and they don't use a lot of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a little pricey upfront,
but I think they are worth the money if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a quality LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't have much experience
with LED lighting, but I have seen great
[SPEAKER_00]: things from LED lights in small veg,
in large veg, and through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing about an LED in
veg is the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also important when it comes to
T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up because I overlooked that
part when I was talking about T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any notes on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all coming out of the top of my
head today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me catch myself before I go too
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 lights are commonly available in two
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you will find them in a
3000 Kelvin and a 6400 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your veg phase, I recommend the 6400
Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will put off a more blue light,
which is what we want for the veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, when we moved to flower,
we want more of that orange spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you would switch to the
3000 Kelvin T5 bulbs if you were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower under them, which I do not
recommend, but they are great for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spectrum is very important and I almost
overlooked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were selecting your T5 bulbs,
make sure that you get the 6400 Kelvin
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what I would recommend for your
veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommended the bluer or whiter
spectrum lights when it comes to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the new LEDs give you the option
to turn on certain boards and turn off
[SPEAKER_00]: certain boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were vegging, you want more of
the blue and whiter spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, once we turn to flower,
that's when we want those orange and red
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're in veg, whatever kind of
light you're using, focus more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: white or blue spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got another option for lighting
that I can recommend, but I would only
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest this for a very small scale grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for one or two very small plants,
maybe for a cabinet grow or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be an effective grow light in a
pinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen a lot of folks build a small
grow cabinet with a compact fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those CFLs, they put off barely any heat
and they use barely any electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get enough of them around
your plant to feel like you're giving it
[SPEAKER_00]: enough light, the plant will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect huge growth, don't expect
robust plants, don't expect a large
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, but you can make a plant grow
with a compact fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the more light the better,
but some people are very limited in space
[SPEAKER_00]: and power and some people only want a
small grow for a small personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a compact fluorescent light may work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would always be my very last option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a big boy light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are familiar with growing
under high intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to flower under
an HID light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are careful to not roast the plants,
a metal halide light will be perfect for
[SPEAKER_00]: your small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a 400, maybe a 600, a thousand maybe
overkill unless you keep it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: distance away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a 400 watt light fairly close
to your small plants if you keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a ducted hood and you're
keeping air moving over that light to
[SPEAKER_00]: where none of that heat is making it to
your canopy, you can get that 400 watt
[SPEAKER_00]: light fairly close to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't let that heat roast your plants
and dehydrate your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say maybe keep a 400 watt light 18
to 24 inches away from your small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The T5s, you can get those T5s six to
eight inches away from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the light, we need to go a
little further because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter and more intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to have super hot
intense light right in your face all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You survive from the sun and you're happy
with it being real far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the plants and the light and
the sun and yourself having a similar kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need plenty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want anything in the way,
but also you don't want to get barbecued.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put a 400 watt light 18,
24 inches away, a 600, I would probably go
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30 inches away, a thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to be a few feet away
from those small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a 400 watt light and
it's ducted, which means it's got a duct
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off of each end and you're sucking
air through it to move that heat away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got glass between the bulb and
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to run a 400 watt light
with very minimal problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay attention to heat and the
distance from those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pretty much covers our
lighting options for our small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the temperature and
humidity for these small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, my small plants appear
to be happiest when they are somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think they like it about 75
degrees to 77 degrees is right about the
[SPEAKER_00]: prime spot for small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I see the most growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I see the most production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I see the most root
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I see the happiest plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees,
or if you can dial it in perfectly,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75 to 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 is that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really seem to like it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for that temperature to work
perfectly, you need to dial in your
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, temperature and humidity work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a math equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This creates what is called a vapor
pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to listen to episode three
14 and learn about vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's talk about humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small plants would like to be in an
environment with the humidity somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 50 and 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that when the humidity is
too low, the plants do not produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no production for the whole day
when the humidity is too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves start to droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants don't make any progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't look as robust as they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no productivity in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also start to develop a woody
texture on the outside of the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage proper humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much humidity on the other hand can
cause similar problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause slow growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can encourage powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep the plants happy by giving
them the proper conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much better do you perform when you
are happy with your conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I made you go do your job, some of you
are going to laugh at me because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I made you go do your job outside in 30
degree weather and shorts and a t-shirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: how happy are you going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put you in shorts and a t-shirt and
put you in a 77 degree room and I dial
[SPEAKER_00]: that humidity back to about 50%,
you're going to be completely comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room and you're going to get a lot
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants feel the same about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep them comfortable and we keep
them happy, they're going to produce for
[SPEAKER_00]: us and give us what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't keep them happy, if we don't
treat them properly, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give us shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a struggle the entire
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for temperature, I want somewhere
between 70 and 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around 75 to 77 is that sweet spot
from what I have experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, with humidity, I like to stay
between 50 and 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too low, you start slowing down growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too high, you start slowing down growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I highly recommend you go listen to
episode 314 and learn all about vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, we have talked about
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is going to turn into a
long podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 20 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm going to take a couple of
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be right back and we will talk
about nutrients and feeding our new small
[SPEAKER_00]: veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, while I'm taking a couple of
dabs, I thought it would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to give thanks to people who
have supported the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge thanks to my friend
Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a giant thanks to Aldridge,
a big giant shout out to Tanner
[SPEAKER_00]: Martinowick and also a big shout out to
Todd Keller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show on Patreon, all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: go to patreon.com slash grow from your
heart and all of the information will be
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very well medicated and I'm ready to
talk more about our small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we were going to jump into
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I want to add to
our grow environment before we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what we are feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add a small fan to our grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ruffle each leaf of our small
plants as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the fan blasting the plants
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the fan making the plants
bend over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a whole lot of fan activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an oscillating fan,
that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on low and just let it breeze
across the canopy of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make the plants more robust
and it's going to make them develop
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the plants do better when we
give them a little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's wind outside, it would get
blown around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that what happens when I push you,
if I shove you a little bit, not super
[SPEAKER_00]: hard, you know, but if I just give you a
little nudge, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural instinct is to spread your feet
further apart to have better balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel like if we blow on a plant,
make it wobble around a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's going to spread its roots a
little bit wider to get better balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will also result in a more robust
stock, which will result in an overall
[SPEAKER_00]: more productive plant when we move that
plant into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give the plants a little bit of
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would get wind outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's introduce a little bit of that to
our indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't blast the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some of the leaves closest to that fan
start getting dry or leathery,
[SPEAKER_00]: or crinkly, or they start looking like a
potato chip, they're getting blasted too
[SPEAKER_00]: hard by the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce either the fan speed or the
frequency that they're getting hit by the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting too much air movement and
you're disrupting the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will let you know if they're getting
too much wind, but give them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of airflow and your plants will really be
happy for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like a nice little breeze,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice warm day, nice sunshine on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next best thing that could come
along is just a nice little breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plants kind of feel the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them a nice little breeze and I
think they will appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make them stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make them more robust and you'll
give them just some fresh air more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about
nutrients for our small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a supercharged nutrient
regimen for these little plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to shock them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stunt them while they're
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to focus on a balanced diet and I
like to focus, like I keep saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: on root development for these small
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like a light vegetative nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with bottled nutrients,
here are a few things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are working in cocoa or soil or a
soilless mix or hydro, you need to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to whatever product line you
decide to buy and see if they offer a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, a cocoa or a hydro variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients will be chelated differently
and they will be in different ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: because your plants will uptake things
differently in different mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the companies that make nutrients
offer a soil or a hydro option when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to buying their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing in cocoa, I recommend
you get the hydroponic version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product you are buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa is more like hydro than it is like
soil or a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're shopping for nutrients and
you're in cocoa, I would recommend that
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy the bottle that is recommended for
hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're looking at bottled
nutrients, you're going to find three
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers displayed on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the NPK value of that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first number is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells us the ratio of nitrogen in
that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next number will be the amount of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next number will be the amount of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to veg nutrients,
we are looking for a product with a high N
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio and lower P and K numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a lot of phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to focus on that nitrogen for
building strong, robust plants with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a good solid grow base
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about base
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever company you choose to work with,
they probably offer a two or three part
[SPEAKER_00]: base nutrient system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them will have a grow and a
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use the grow for your vegetative stage
and you use the bloom for your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies offer a two part
product, which will be an A and a B grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also offer an A and a B bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't need those, so let's talk
about those later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will take your grow A and grow B and
you will mix those into your water to
[SPEAKER_00]: create your vegetative nutrient base
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they sell an A and a B is
because there are things in bottle A and
[SPEAKER_00]: things in bottle B that will bind together
chemically if they are mixed together
[SPEAKER_00]: without being diluted in our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would fill your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally use a five gallon bucket in a
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd fill your five gallon bucket with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would apply the correct amount,
the appropriate amount of veg A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would apply the appropriate
amount of veg B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would continue to add the rest of
the required nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a two part vegetative nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other companies will offer their products
in a different format.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will offer what is called a base and
then they will give you a grow and a bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: to add on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that type of nutrient regimen,
you will use that base product through the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire cycle, through veg and through
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll use that grow additive during
the growth phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you switch to flower, you'll switch
to that flowering additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just put the appropriate additives
in those bottles to keep everything
[SPEAKER_00]: running smoothly with that base nutrient
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now whatever brand you choose,
be sure you get the appropriate veg
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a two part, make sure you get the
A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the kind where you have to have a
base and a grow nutrient, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the base and the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get something simple where there's
just a bottle that says veg, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that one strong veg nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like we have a good
handle on base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a good base nutrient with a strong
nitrogen value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would recommend you feed those
plants maybe a quarter of the recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: strength for the first couple of times you
feed your plants new nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a light feeding and pay close
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down so that you know exactly
what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also write down the pH, write down the EC
if that is an option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more notes you take, the more you can
do research to dial in where you went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us consume a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us consume cannabis while we're
working in the gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you say, I wonder what I put in
there and you have no idea where you went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't happen if you take notes and
write things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an entire episode on journaling
and I suggest you listen to that one as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a reliable base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've decided how much to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started a quarter strength, maybe work
your way up to a third, maybe a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're definitely not going to need full
strength nutrients for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your nutrient companies will
offer a feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those feeding schedules will have
a small plant recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still recommend you reduce that a little
bit until you see how the plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: With small plants, I always recommend some
sort of mycoproduct, some sort of root
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant product, something to make those
roots go kapow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to avoid recommending specific
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a long list of reliable products
that will work great for your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Mammoth P. I like Plus Life from
Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Recharge from Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Great White Shark and Orca and
MycoChum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a great combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those products are a little
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also recommend a product called
Mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very affordable bag of micro
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are using some sort of
micro product, I think you will see very
[SPEAKER_00]: increased root production compared to if
you did not use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I like the higher end,
fancier, more expensive products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you can't afford that, get what you
can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend a microbe or a myco or
a root inoculant product for your small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will really speed up your production
and I think the plants will really show a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge difference and you will notice it and
it will make you a happier grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a reliable vegetative
nutrient with enough nitrogen in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have decided on a microbe product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be enough for our small veg
plants for two to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to add some fulvic acid to
your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like adding some fulvic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes the plants uptake the
nutrients more quickly and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really worth the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a small bottle of fulvic acid will
really improve your nutrient uptake in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got a good solid base
nutrient and you're feeding your roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've added a little fulvic acid that's
increasing the uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants get a little bit bigger,
you may need to introduce some CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to overuse overdose small
plants on CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the young plants really don't
react well to too much CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, basically we've got a veg nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a little bit of fulvic acid and
maybe around week three, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: add a dose of CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: This feed should keep our plants super
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important thing we need to think about
is the pH of our feeding solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: For plants this size, I generally
recommend we adjust the pH somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 5.9 and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we adjust the pH after all of
the nutrients have been mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add in the appropriate recommended
amount of each bottle of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you give it a good stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's nice and mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we check the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a solid veg mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a pH adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to water our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend when you water, you saturate
your medium thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drown the plants, but make sure that
all of the soil or cocoa or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: medium you are watering, make sure it is
saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want any dry pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your roots will not grow into dry spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisten all of your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is probably a good time to remind you
guys of episode 337, where I do a lesson
[SPEAKER_00]: on what is called one through five water
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower and you haven't
heard the one through five water tech
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion, I highly recommend you listen
to that episode right after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is episode 337 and it will teach you a
lot about watering your plants correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have appropriately watered our small
plants with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we need to give our plants
nutrients again?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cocoa, I like to feed nutrients to my
plants at every single watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single day I will feed my plants a
solid base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will add a booster every day and I
will rotate those boosters depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what the plants may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this small veg case, my booster would
be the Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water the nutrients, I would put
the base nutrient, I would put the fulvic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid and I would put the mycos in my
nutrient solution every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once a week, I would put that Cal Mag
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my booster for these small
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're working in soil or soilless
mix, you don't need to feed nutrients as
[SPEAKER_00]: often because they stick around in the
dirt a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you feed with nutrients
one feed, then water the next feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're feeding with just clean water,
please adjust the pH just like you do when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're mixing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill your container with water,
stick your pH meter in there, see what it
[SPEAKER_00]: says, adjust it up or down accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to adjust the pH at every
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend you do one feeding of
nutrients, one watering of pH adjusted
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go back to that basic
nutrient regimen for the next watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small veg plants will need frequent
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them get too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them be over watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, check out the one through five
watering tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to pay attention to
is over nutrienting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we over fertilizing these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we burning them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the very tips of the leaves start to
look brown or the wrong color or if they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to curl, we are feeding too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaves look pale and yellow,
we are not feeding enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a mixture of those two
symptoms, your pH is probably off.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the very first things I recommended
in these grow lessons was that you buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: book and you read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've already done some
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have looked at some leaf
charts and you know what deficiencies look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what a healthy leaf looks like
and you know what an unhealthy leaf looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to pop out in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see those leaves doing something
weird, you're going to say, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: what the book said this should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you've gotten the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are showing you that they need
more nutrients, increase your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little more base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't need to increase the
amount of fulvic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to mycos, I have learned
that it is better to feed small amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: more frequently than to try to feed a
whole bunch at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to do any good by pouring
the whole bottle in there at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be more effective to pour the
bottle in there slowly over a course of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if you see a deficiency,
just increase that base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to run into a deficiency
with in small plants is either going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen or Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be your most common
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to those two things and
learn what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next common thing you're going to find
is nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to try to feed too much
to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard somebody say the term moron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to put more on it to make it
grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was hilarious when I heard
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're running a hydroponic
system, if you're in Rockwell cubes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing a top feed or if you're in
some type of ebb and flow system,
[SPEAKER_00]: your small veg phase will not be nearly as
long as us growing in cocoa or a soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your small veg phase zips right by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the hydro grows go much more
quickly in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your small veg phase may be only about
a week long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to introduce more
nutrients at a higher rate sooner in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pay attention to the plants that is
very plant specific and very strain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since the plants grow a little more
quickly, you are going to need more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm going to remind you of in
your hydroponics is to stay on top of your
[SPEAKER_00]: pH and your EC or your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it every single day and adjust as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is going to evaporate from your
hydroponic setup, but the nutrients will
[SPEAKER_00]: not evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your pH and your PPMs are going to
fluctuate during that evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the plants are going to consume some
of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water is going to disappear
throughout the day, which is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause changes in your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a hydroponic grower, you need to be on
top of that every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm going to recommend you take
extra notes as a hydro grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reactions happen a little more quickly and
the plants are a little more sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're running hydro because you
don't have that big soil life system to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, boys and girls, I feel like
that is a good talk on small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave these plants in these
pots for two to four weeks, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how quickly they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very environment dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to remind you to do is
spread your small veg plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have them crushed together now
because they're small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as they get larger, make sure you
spread them out, give them more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got them all crushed together,
they're going to grow straight up and get
[SPEAKER_00]: real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them space to branch out,
they will do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you top them, you've got
nice bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I know I didn't talk about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't talk about containers in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered that in the previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were up to speed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to leave these plants in these
containers for two to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will pop them into three gallon or
five gallon or perhaps seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you out there are going to
go huge and go into a 20 or an even larger
[SPEAKER_00]: container, but we're going to work on that
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a little time to let these
plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job now is to keep them healthy,
keep them happy, keep them pest and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep working on those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any yellow or funky leaves,
make sure you pull that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take good care of your new sweet
little babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they don't have any problems so
that when we transplant them into their
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pots, they're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a fat root system and they
don't go into any shock from a transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just realized that I did not cover any
pest management for our small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you have decided on an
integrated pest management system for your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden before this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that was part of your planning
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we don't have any pests or
problems on our small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks will choose to apply a
pesticide as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks will wait until they see a
problem to use a pesticide on a plant this
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to wait until I transplant
these into their three gallon pots before
[SPEAKER_00]: I put any pesticides on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in some environments,
I don't trust the place and I need to put
[SPEAKER_00]: a pesticide on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use something like Evergreen and I
would probably use it around 15 mils per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure to apply it while the
lights were off and I would be sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants were completely dry before I
turned the lights back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would probably do this approximately
every five to seven days while the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are little, if I were in a place that had
a reputation for getting a pest
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like that should keep us
pest free for the first four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can really start implementing
our integrated pest management once we
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant into those three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I feel like that
is a solid show about small veg.

[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while I'm talking about Patreon,
let me bring up something I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: forgetting to mention on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, Patreon changed the way that
contributors cards are billed.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that process, many contributors
were removed from content creators pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you are contributing to a
Patreon campaign, I encourage you to log
[SPEAKER_00]: into your Patreon account and check the
status of all your content creators.

[SPEAKER_00]: Support from our community means a lot to
content creators, and it would really
[SPEAKER_00]: break our hearts to lose contributions

[SPEAKER_00]: creating and keep the vibe alive and keep
