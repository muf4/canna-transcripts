has this dab the fuck out look on their
face.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a little glazed, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's like, let's get really high for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody in the room argued that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone was like, I like this idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody jumped right on that idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a little roasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that as soon as I hit play on
the opening track, I wanted to cop real
[SPEAKER_04]: hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting through that intro was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was proud of myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of dabbing, this episode is going
to be a lot about dabbing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: But coming up in a future episode,
it has been confirmed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to have the wonderful,
the Miss Dabbing Granny on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you know about the Dabbing Granny,
stay tuned for a future episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: She will be joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if I'm going to her,
if she's coming to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay, can you tell us a little bit
about your friend, the Dabbing Granny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dropping the real name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Name dropping like you're the homie now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just kick it with Gale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's how this is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, Dabbing Granny, because I just
feel so whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing Granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing Granny and I met in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have hung out at Canna Canyon
a couple of times and gotten to take some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to hang out with Brett,
Mary's motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually left work for lunch for 30
minutes and got to go over to Canna Canyon
[SPEAKER_00]: and hang out with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brett, THC Sam, THC Magazine Sam and a
couple other people, Chandler and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was super fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, she's just big on social media
because everybody wants to follow a
[SPEAKER_00]: Dabbing Granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, a shout out to Dabbing Granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, she listens to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you told me that she listens to the
podcast, you put the biggest smile on my
[SPEAKER_04]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, you have Brett to thank for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I mean, like I was just sitting
there, but we were Brett and I were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the podcast at Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Granny was like, what podcast is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brett said, give me your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the phone from her and he
subscribed her to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so she turns to me and she
said, you're on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I said, I'm very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Jeff has me on the podcast way
more than I should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fortunate to have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a mutual thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she started listening to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like, I guess one of the first
couple of ones that I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: first couple of ones she listens to
actually were, but she listened to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary talk one with the three of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she commented on my something and she
was like, oh, was it me that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about flirting with you in the
dispensary?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody, a lot of people might know who
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys check out the Dabbing Granny on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I discovered her, she took a giant
dab, like a big dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: She took like a hundred of my dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the first time I saw the video,
I felt so bad about the size of my dab
[SPEAKER_03]: like the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a little young to be my granny,
but she could be Lindsay's granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: She could definitely be your granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's a granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not being derogatory calling her
granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's damn granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her Instagram handle is dabbing underscore
granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm pretty sure it's the Dabbing
Granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the Dabbing Granny on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know about her YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think that's where she shouted out
your thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the shout out, Dabbing Granny,
Granny, Gail, whatever I'm supposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: call you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to go with granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she takes a giant dab off of a rig and
then she chugs a beer, like a whole pint
[SPEAKER_04]: glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she takes a shot and then she
blows out her dab and takes another dab
[SPEAKER_04]: from the nectar collector and smiles into
the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's how you do it, bitches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then ends the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually like one of her staple
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: She kind of like changes it around a
little bit, but like, I'm pretty sure she
[SPEAKER_00]: did that on Facebook live today or some
version of that, you know, like a dab of
[SPEAKER_00]: beer and then like a shot and then
something, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a bong rip or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so I think she does some sort of
variation and that's her like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she calls it her party trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really could be wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's I think that's where she
really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her version of the strikeout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's impressive as all hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I watched the video,
it caught my eye because it was someone
[SPEAKER_03]: who could be my grandmother with the dab
lined up that was like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was YouTube dab worthy size.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dab I would be proud to take.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe half a gram, three quarters of a
gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she takes this dab like a champ.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I'm sitting there like,
wow, she like throws down a pint and then
[SPEAKER_03]: does a bong rip and then exhales the bong
rip and the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm looking at this video and my mind
just shocked at what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was instantly a fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I bet a lot of people her YouTube her
Facebook or Instagram is just exploding as
[SPEAKER_04]: people listen to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys go support Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Granny, we're going to get you on
the podcast really soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look forward to that in a future episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a cannabis advocate.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a smoker, but she's a savage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my favorite part about her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: She seems to be super sweet from
everything I've seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Granny, can't wait to have you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay, thanks for arranging that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your fault that you said blame
Brett.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brett, thanks for arranging that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys got Granny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't reach out to her.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got her listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought her here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's your guys' fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I love about the idea of
places like Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the community doesn't have any good
place to meet up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as we started getting them,
really cool connections started being
[SPEAKER_03]: made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got something to say ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you like, I thought you were
meaning it in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Lindsay, that's your
fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, no, no, I was picking
on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something else Lindsay said that I
really liked Brett right on for just
[SPEAKER_04]: grabbing someone's phone and subscribing
them to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do that more frequently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get my phone and be like, here,
you're subscribed to Ross Degev's podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen his Instagram lives like his
snap?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the new Instagram Snapchat?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been in tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one he ever put up was like by
Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this like he's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next one was just something
like, oh, my God, I'm so excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can answer all your questions now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes like down and then he comes
back up and he's like, I am in my
[SPEAKER_00]: underwear right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just cuts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, yes, these are going
to be so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dude's a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Brett.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the turp love.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys want to talk about that new,
stupid Instagram feature?
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to just give it a second?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new feature on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I care or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give out my Instagram is because I
don't even use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've I only open it when it says I
have a bunch of notifications and I only
[SPEAKER_03]: open it to clear the notifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just feels like it never ends.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just so many pictures that scroll
by.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't even care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot that I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you have to remember is that
Instagram was originally just pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how far Instagram has actually
evolved and what it actually started from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you really hate them for doing a live
feature for trying to be Snapchat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really like I have pros and cons
about it, so I just don't really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just feel like they're trying to suck up
too much of my attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I can scroll up and down and left and
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just fucks me all up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no end to it now because
there's so I'm just like, oh, that's
[SPEAKER_04]: enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we're talking about social media,
this is a good segue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got three names of folks that I have
got envelopes with your name written on
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a stamp on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a return address label on there
that someone claimed was mediocre,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think it's just fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to work just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a return address label on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that gets lost, it will get back to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get it back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you that receive these,
feel free to comment about the quality of
[SPEAKER_03]: the labels and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to hear your comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be stickers in there for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are to say thank you for
participating in Twitter challenges or
[SPEAKER_04]: just for being a friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want some stickers,
contact me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit me up on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit me up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit me up on the Twitter or you can email
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail dot
com.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real trick is to listen to the whole
episode when it's a longer one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that does help out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That pays off.
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, if you follow me on Twitter
or Instagram or something, send me a
[SPEAKER_04]: message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram is Iri, I-R-I-E, underscore
genetics, Iri genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you used to be following me,
you might not now because a long time ago
[SPEAKER_04]: they crushed my account and I've started a
new account.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had like almost 20,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only around six or 7,000 now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So come follow me again, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grow from your heart podcast.

some stickers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to James Howlett.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get some stickers in the
mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason Hawkins, you got stickers coming in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sammy, bro, you got some stickers
coming in the mail, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: My painted chef friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also that segues right into the next part.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you guys like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Double segue.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a Grateful Dead style.
[SPEAKER_04]: One right into the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep on jamming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sammy asked about easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_04]: His basic question was, do you recommend
an easy cloner?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like an easy cloner?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I love an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I really like about an easy cloner is
you can cut large clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take big clones, they'll root
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those big clones, I think they take
off much more quickly than clones and
[SPEAKER_04]: rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike remembers my old school days of
trying to cut clones and rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took so many clones and put them in
rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did that for a lot of years with a lot
of different growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike used to be like a grow hand for
everybody around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the easy cloner is a huge step
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, if you're growing and cloning
regularly, it's worth the investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make sure you get a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember your first easy cloner,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's not talk too much about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but two seconds after you had plugged
it in, your advice would have been don't
[SPEAKER_03]: buy one that crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those old ones sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new models are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they worked out all the tanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't explode and turn your grow room
into a water park anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best description.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are new models.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new easy cloners, the low,
what do they call them?
[SPEAKER_04]: The low rise, the low profile models.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're white now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really dig them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They require less water, which is really
helpful because that also means less
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only familiar with the big black
beast, but it gets the double thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing, but just a new
design.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to leak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how the old black ones used to
spray out of the sides because they had
[SPEAKER_03]: the...
[SPEAKER_03]: They drip a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't leak or drip.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't drip anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new design is way better.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're easier to clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like the new easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sammy, if you're looking to up your clone
game, get yourself an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is super easy to use that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a healthy mother... Okay,
get your cloner set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: By that I mean get the cloner fucking
built.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the neoprens in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the little manifold in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it spraying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it running.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill it up with water just below those red
sprayers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how much water you put in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Figure that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would use a little bit of bloom,
like your base bloom nutrient,
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit of micro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just dip them in some... I like to use the
easy cloner gel.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that one called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, I can't think of the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clonex.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a purple clonex gel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to use that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dip it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put in the little neoprene collar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut it to where there's two or three nodes
underneath that collar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that shit in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the cloner on for 45 minutes on,
15 minutes off because that water will
[SPEAKER_04]: heat up because of that pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a T5 light about a foot above that and
just let the T5 light run 24 hours a day
[SPEAKER_04]: and no shit in seven or eight days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll start seeing little warts pop out
of the plant and that's where the roots
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 10 to 14 days, you'll have savage
roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 17 to 21 days, those roots are going to
be so big, you'll have to go to a three
[SPEAKER_04]: gallon pot and skip a cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: A huge step up in technology from the old
school clone domes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge step up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly, highly recommend those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use those at the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run a big commercial grow and I've got
one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are six easy cloners filled with
clones right now at the grow and that's
[SPEAKER_04]: how we keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could go on like this about the cloner
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really an awesome product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, so easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to send me some easy
cloners, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could just use like 160 site or 190
site, just for my personal setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need anything for the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just send me one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sammy, I hope I answered your question,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's not too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that took me a while to get to that
message.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do one episode a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to fix that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I did two a week, I could probably get
more questions answered.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay, you all right over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Headphones all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my ear.
[SPEAKER_04]: You getting headphone ear?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have a- You have a ear?
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even worth it tonight,
I don't feel like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of late at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay's real high, so picking on her is
way too simple.
This is the dab episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got good and fried to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike just segwayed us right in again.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's jammed us right into the next topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the last episode, we talked a lot about
dabbing and stuff and I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: email temperature and getting your email
set to the temperature that is perfect for
[SPEAKER_04]: you because I like my email a little bit
hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Spence was here, Spence from Garden of
Weed and shout out to my brother Spence,
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spence would back me up every time he did
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spence would reach right over and just
turn my email down like, motherfucker,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would just turn it down like he owned
that bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lightly scold you for having it too
hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's my email and I like them
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it was just a beautiful thing to
watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty funny, but I just let Spence
do his thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a hash maker and he would bring over
slabs and dab me out with them and you
[SPEAKER_04]: could make it whatever temp you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to drop that much hash on
there, do your thing, Claire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people keep their emails a little
lower than I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like mine a little hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody was asking me, how do I get my
email to the perfect temperature?
[SPEAKER_04]: The temperature is all kind of subjective.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about, do you want it hot and
hurty?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want it low temp, all taste?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the new trend is to heat a nail
and this is not the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is if you're using like a banger.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new trend is to heat the nail,
let it get way too hot and then let it
[SPEAKER_04]: cool way down and then put your dab on
there and waste half the fucking dab and
[SPEAKER_04]: then act like it tasted real good and then
get a Q-tip and clean it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what all the trendy kids are doing
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you see at all the events.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not my style.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to heat it and when it's hot enough
to cook the dab, I drop a real big dab on
[SPEAKER_04]: it and make sure it all cooks and I get a
big thick, fat milky hit that makes my
[SPEAKER_04]: eyes water and makes my lungs kind of
twitter a little bit and I put a carb cap
[SPEAKER_04]: on it and make it even fatter and I like
to get a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So setting the email to the perfect temp
is kind of subjective for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I would say to do it and use a
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely use a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here I actually went and Googled a part
about a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about a carb cap for a second
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually comes from High Times
Magazine and it was written, I wrote it
[SPEAKER_04]: down, it's written by Sean Black.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The carb cap is exactly what it sounds
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: The carburetor for your rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: It restricts, what the fuck does that word
mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It restricts the amount of airflow to your
nail allowing you to collect the last bits
[SPEAKER_04]: of your oil to punctuate the end of your
hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the part that's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: By capping the nail, you restrict the
airflow into the rig through the small
[SPEAKER_04]: contact area between the cap and the edge
of the nail while inhaling strongly the
[SPEAKER_04]: reduced air.
[SPEAKER_04]: The air flow places the entire rig under
low pressure including the oil that pulled
[SPEAKER_04]: on the nail without vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under low pressure, every component of the
hash oil suddenly has a lower boiling
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: What once boiled, it should say which,
which once boiled at high temperatures can
[SPEAKER_04]: now do so at much lower temperatures
giving you a bloom of thicker,
[SPEAKER_04]: better tasting smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: The carb cap lets you actually finish the
dab instead of wasting it in a thick
[SPEAKER_04]: sputtering puddle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trend now you guys is that thick
sputtering puddle because everyone wants
[SPEAKER_04]: to taste the Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps is the new word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps is the new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that carb cap description there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get your email, you guys set it too
hot, set it too low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go one direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend just slowly climb up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking for the sweet spot in
between wasting a lot of your product and
[SPEAKER_03]: burning the living fuck out of your throat
like I did to myself last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: How far away right now is my finger from
the top of that nail?
[SPEAKER_04]: Inch and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: So put your fingers an inch to two inches
above the nail and it should be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: sit there comfortably for like one or two
seconds before like, Ooh, that's hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should feel like your finger's getting
pinched.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like someone's just pinching your finger a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about the right temperature where I
like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You agree?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of feels like you're getting pinched
after a couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the toy that I should have now that I
don't is a laser temp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've got one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one at home too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally I've left the house with
money in my pocket to go buy one a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of times and something happens and I ended
up at home without one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not in the cards because it's
not necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have to remind me of this
conversation in a much sober.
[SPEAKER_04]: Magic just happened here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on what kind of hash you're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if you're smoking shatter like this
shatter, you could put it on there kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had some wax, it'd probably go
hotter.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I smoke in live res, I might turn it
down just a bit to get more of that taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it depends on the concentrate you've
got you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the concentrate that you've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the nail set a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the dab on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't put the carb cap on,
start smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that dab doesn't melt enough,
obviously turn that shit up and just go
[SPEAKER_04]: five or 10 degrees higher every time until
you get the dab you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't recommend the carb cap enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you use one, when you throw
it on top of the nail, the first thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes through your head is where'd all
that come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: As you watch the vapor going through your
rig, quadruple and thicken because that
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't on your nail a second ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had you taken a breath and hit it,
you wouldn't have gotten it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And suddenly you've got a huge milked out
rig going for you again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love just when you cap it and you just
see it and you just start pulling like,
[SPEAKER_04]: ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the reason I've been so
baked the last couple of shows I've done
[SPEAKER_03]: is because I didn't have one at home for
the last several months and was not
[SPEAKER_03]: getting nearly as stoned at home because I
didn't have all the tools with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you drop the carb cap on there,
you guys, you're pulling your hit,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're taking your hit and then you get
enough smoke to fill your lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to blow out so that you could
pull the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't take the carb cap off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at that time you're letting all
that vapor and that pressure and that
[SPEAKER_04]: vacuum that you've created, you've just
ruined that by letting the carb cap off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave that carb cap on there almost until
you're done dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's a good idea to lift it
because that fucker gets hot, but just put
[SPEAKER_04]: it on there, inhale, blow your head out,
leave the cap on, inhale the rest and then
[SPEAKER_04]: take it off as soon as you're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't take it off until you're done
dabbing because a lot of folks lose part
[SPEAKER_04]: of their dab that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people feather them and try to
get fancy with it and just set it on there
[SPEAKER_04]: and let her go.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I do, I honestly do turn it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one hole in there on the top of
that carb cap and I like to turn it just
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think that I move my oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take a larger dab than most folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I need to spread it across the top of
the nail just a little bit more than some.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not trying to be the elitist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just take big fucking dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're talking temperature,
I can get away with a much lower temp and
[SPEAKER_03]: not waste anything because I'm putting a
much smaller dab to the nail each time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them hot and heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do a low temp half gram or a
gram dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You end up doing a .2 dab and the rest of
it puddles and then you feel like a dick
[SPEAKER_03]: for wasting a bunch of your hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to mention one more thing and then
you just kind of segwayed me into another
[SPEAKER_04]: part I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, when you're taking a dab with a
carb cap and you're using an e-nail,
[SPEAKER_04]: this happened at the Canna Canyon and it
happens here occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to bring this up for the
folks that are learning to dab and even
[SPEAKER_04]: the experienced dabbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bruh, when you're done dabbing,
take the carb cap off the e-nail because
[SPEAKER_04]: that e-nail is turned on and it's hot and
you leave that carb cap on there and it
[SPEAKER_04]: heats up the carb cap and then whoever
sees it wants to take a dab, they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking about, that is hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're thinking, I want a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they reach for the carb cap and they
burn the shit out of themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please take that, yeah, please take that
carb cap off of the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just set it on an oil slick pad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see so many people, there's an oil slick
pad on my table.
[SPEAKER_04]: This pad is designed to catch hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will not stick to here.
[SPEAKER_04]: My table right here, this wood part,
the hash will stick to this all fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put the carb cap down on the oil
slick pad if you see one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what that's for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Utilize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, now I said that would segue me
into another part that I wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're giving dabs to somebody,
is it up to me to heat that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like if I give you a dab,
this will be another question I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of us pulls a dab off the parchment
paper for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll heat the rig to be nice just because
we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna heat the, I know Mike,
I know, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna heat the nail to the appropriate
temperature and then I'm gonna,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe we're camping, and I'm gonna heat
the nail to the appropriate temperature
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm gonna hand it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I hang on to that fucker until it's the
right temp or do I give it to you and let
[SPEAKER_04]: you decide when to dab that thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So much just depends on who you're talking
about handing it to and their level of
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I was just gonna say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's someone new, and new to dabbing,
I would just be like, okay, I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: probably hold onto it until it was ready
and then give it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's somebody you know dabs a lot,
let them make that choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heat it up, hand it to them, let them do
the hand over the nail like a wizard
[SPEAKER_04]: trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because do you remember a couple of
weeks ago when we were having a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about how somebody heated up
a torch for you, like a rig for you and
wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this is all about,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where this came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody tried to be nice and give me a
big fat dab and they heated the nail nice
[SPEAKER_04]: and hot and when I went to pick up the
rig, they put their hand on it and said,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm polite, I'm like, cool,
you're giving me a dab, I'll let you do
[SPEAKER_04]: your thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in my mind, I thought it's gonna cool
down way too much and this big dab is just
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna end up as a puddle on your nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys are proud of how much they
clean out of their rig with the Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna smoke that, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We paid for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dispensary wasn't like, oh,
you're gonna Q-tip it, here's 30% off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand how people can waste
that amount of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when you're paying 20,
30, 60, 80, 100 a gram for hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you waste half of it on just
letting it puddle and then Q-tipping it
[SPEAKER_03]: into the trash?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like taking two sips off your beer
and putting the rest of the bottle in the
[SPEAKER_03]: trash and ordering another beer and
drinking that way all night.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me your money instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's an experienced dabber,
let that dude choose how hot he wants it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wanna burn my lungs, if I wanna roast
my esophagus, let me do it, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're bringing new people in,
be gentle.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us have a good story about the
introducing someone to hash where they
[SPEAKER_03]: were like, no, I wanna take the hit you
took.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we give it one or two, no,
you don't, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a bit of advice, go slow,
very strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they resist a little bit so we say
fuck it and let them jump off the cliff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not necessarily cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've told the story of the dude,
a guy, I was at a cannabis cup and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a guy walked up and he said,
what are you doing there, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, smoking dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, I ain't ever seen dabs
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get a dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gave him what I thought would be a
normal first dab for a guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got offended.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, that's a little, I saw what you
smoked, give me what you smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I've been doing this,
bro, that's gonna fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I don't care, I can smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I did what he asked for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gave him a Jeff size dab,
heated it up, hooked him up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dude took that hit and pulled in the
smoke and blew it out and vanished.
[SPEAKER_04]: He walked into the crowd like,
bye, I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was so high, he didn't know what to do
with himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: He couldn't look me in the eye anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought it was kind of funny,
but he asked for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked for a good chunk of my day
explaining to people who aren't familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with hash and edibles to please go slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk to people all the time that have,
I took the way too big a dab and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like the longest 12 hours of my life while
I waited to come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel bad for those people and it's
unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we used to be a little gentler with
it and there used to be an initiation
[SPEAKER_03]: process before these products were
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it negated the necessity to say a lot
of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people out there whose first
experience with cannabis was a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's unfair.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the first time you drank when
you were in middle school or a teenager or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you had moonshine and you guys
were fucking beer funneling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their boof and shine for your first
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same thing when I hear like
my first intro to marijuana was a giant
[SPEAKER_03]: dab alive resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, and what happened next?
[SPEAKER_03]: You spent seven hours in your hotel room
wondering if you were dead or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just you were too big to handle
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it never should have happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you didn't need to be in that end of
the pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I need to put a disclaimer on my dad
videos?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not try this at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with that, going back to your
original question here, Jeff, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about knowing your audience and about
knowing like who's in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it's a, you know, experienced
dabber, let them do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, then whatever, screw you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, we're, we're, we're mad at
ourselves because we're setting a bad
[SPEAKER_04]: example.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about dabbing in the car,
which shouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hypocrites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, uh, I didn't even mean in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just meant in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say in the car?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all, I, you and I each have slipped
about dabbing in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're outdoorsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We spent a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually do take, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more in nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fucking fun to dab in the car
wash when you're getting the car wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one can see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't dab in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of my shit's portable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's not something I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all portable to me, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they make an adapter for the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get, let's get out of the
incrimination zone here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so dab size.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, I like the temp thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If, if it's somebody new, yeah,
if it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just bring them along slow for your
girlfriend's dab for her, but we can
[SPEAKER_04]: decide our own, our own temp of our own
dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can handle that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If, if, if I'm wearing my logo on my shirt
and I'm at every fucking secret session,
[SPEAKER_04]: you see me at, let me choose my temp on my
dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go hot and hurting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't do glowy's that we call
those glowy's don't do those hurt your
[SPEAKER_04]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about dab size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we're, we're all friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're friends here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we have dabs, we come to the
table, we just, there's some of my hash on
[SPEAKER_04]: the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay's got some hash on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike didn't bring any today, but I'm not
calling them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time he brought some hash that tasted
fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I racked myself with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So flavorful.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're excused this time because it was so
good last time, but we all, if somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: wants a dab, this is my, what is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, uh, this is, um, trez star
shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and Mike wants to dab it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to pass him the parchment.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to pull off a dab for himself
because that's my homie over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how, are you supposed,
am I supposed to pull him off a dab or is
[SPEAKER_03]: that his job or I think Lindsay said it
perfectly a second ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about knowing your audience depends
on who's who, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, you always get that one
kid, uh, you know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So say we're hanging out at the secret
sesh and we're all a bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a bunch of heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a bunch of family.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's always one guy in every
fucking group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know who I'm thinking about right
now, that guy, if you hand him your
[SPEAKER_04]: shatter, he's going to try to smoke all of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this in one dab just because he
wants to smoke as much as he can while
[SPEAKER_04]: he's there and get as high as he can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, every group has that one guy,
that one friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I think it's funny when people ask me
for a dab and they try to do that because
[SPEAKER_04]: then I get to watch them cough and turn
red and turn purple and blow snot out of
[SPEAKER_04]: their face.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth it to me to go ahead and pick
your dab size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the best part for me is watching them
function after that or fail to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know what, Jeff, the thing
about it is, is they watch people like you
[SPEAKER_00]: take huge dabs and, you know, be able to
just take 0.5, you know, or bigger dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sit here and go, well,
I can go on this level with this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take this one, they die,
and then they can't function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know what you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You continue to take 0.5 or bigger dabs
and you keep going through the night and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just like, what is this guy doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been training, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been training.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your triathlon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been going deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your Olympics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for comparison, there's more residue
on the dabber I just used than the dab I
[SPEAKER_03]: just took.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you're the segue champion because I
want to talk about ninja dabs right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I love ninja dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people, we take for granted
that a lot of folks listening to this
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast are not Colorado based people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell by looking at the stats,
and I try to ignore them because I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want it to influence my performance,
but I could tell by looking at the stats
[SPEAKER_04]: that a large portion of our audience is in
Colorado, but more than 50% is not
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado based.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a large portion is not even in
America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people don't get to dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know what dabs are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody put me back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying what the fuck ninja dabs
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if Lindsay was to get herself a dab and
she was to start dabbing, I would
[SPEAKER_04]: sneakily, I've got my MacBook here open.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, while she can't see me behind the
computer, I'd put another dab on another
[SPEAKER_04]: dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as Lindsay starts inhaling
that dab right before she puts the carb
[SPEAKER_04]: cap on, I would reach over and put a
sizable amount of hash on the nail for her
[SPEAKER_04]: and ninja dab her.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get that, just add a little to her
and make her cough and get her a little
[SPEAKER_04]: extra fucked up more than she expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also seen it referred to putting a
dab underneath the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you like, the carb cap is just a,
it's a hunk of metal with a hole in it
[SPEAKER_03]: that you set on top of the hot nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you take some hash and sort of
artificially place it underneath the carb
[SPEAKER_03]: cap, while that carb, or the, while their
carb cap's on their cap and their dab,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to heat up enough to drop that
on the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get a good three, four,
five, 10 seconds into their hit,
[SPEAKER_03]: their hit quadruples all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't even know where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's happened to me more than once and
has led to some less than productive
[SPEAKER_03]: afternoons.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've called those time bombs or land
mines, but I've also heard them called
[SPEAKER_04]: sniper dabs from other folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got multiple carb caps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got multiple carb caps and I'll just
set them out on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: And occasionally one will have a little
snake underneath it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone will take a dab and it just keeps
going and they turn red and they blow snot
[SPEAKER_04]: out of their face and they choke for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really funny to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I laugh a lot because I always know which
one it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the blue one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it ever happens, it's the blue one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one blue one and the rest are
silver.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that makes it easy for me to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't use that fucking blue one if you
come over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see, we're talking about dab
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got notes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give some dab hints.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's summertime and it's hot as shit here
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your dabs are going to be stuck to the
parchment paper and hard to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I saw a dispensary on
Instagram today selling their hash in
[SPEAKER_04]: little plastic disks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Step up your game, use parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put your dabs in parchment paper or one of
those like silicone containers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get away from the plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plastic things where all your dabs stick
to it and you got to scrape it for fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wasting like a quarter gram of hash
in the packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one wants to scrape out of that little
plastic dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you go to scrape out of it,
you realize that it's plastic and half the
[SPEAKER_03]: dabbers out here aren't gentle enough
to... I mean, it quickly becomes a
[SPEAKER_03]: question of, am I willing to dab little
strips of plastic?
[SPEAKER_03]: No is the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or scrape that off my nail or do I just
have to kiss the rest of this hash go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, honestly, step your packaging up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sensitive to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a budtender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like the packaging matters and a lot
of people don't think it through to the
[SPEAKER_03]: end stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come up with the dope product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like putting a Lamborghini
engine in a fucking pinto sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter how good your product
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the packaging is hideous and it's not
displayable, it's going to annoy the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that sell it just a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they're annoyed just a little,
they're going to reference the product
[SPEAKER_03]: that isn't annoying more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to move 10 times faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to make a lot less money all
because you didn't think you're packaging
[SPEAKER_03]: through to the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, we're watching it change in
waves in Colorado right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every hash company had their cool,
unique shaped logoed package.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those are transitioning to almost
identical envelopes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys are seeing it just as fast as
I am up in the springs, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It matters, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to go on a little tangent,
but the packaging matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while the original point of this was
it's summer, the shatter is a little tacky
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a problem when it's a plastic
container.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, use parchment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But where I was headed with that is air
conditioner tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, when your shatter is getting all
funky, go just set that shatter,
[SPEAKER_04]: put it in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're not going to be in there
for more than four or five minutes,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have to put it in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just set that parchment in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Close the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you set it in a dry area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Close the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let that shit get nice and cold for a few
minutes and pull it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you can function with that
shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a whole lot easier to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be real snappy, real
crunchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an air conditioner in places.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can turn on that vent and turn that
fucker up, cool down your carb cap,
[SPEAKER_04]: cool down your dabber, and then you can
cool down your shatter also.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll make it a whole lot easier for you
guys to function.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't buy a lot of shatter
during the summer for this exact reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to bother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I go with a butter or a wax or a
live resin, it's already a little tacky or
[SPEAKER_03]: soupy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The room temperature is not going to mess
with it much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't no season going to stop me from
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just dab different.
[SPEAKER_04]: This ain't seasonal.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something I do all day,
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not no fair weather fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just throw that extra money on hash and
go live resin all summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever been in the cold that were
so cold your torch wouldn't light?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just goes click, click, click and it
won't light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make fire anywhere, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen your dedication to your
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make fire anywhere, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you had been on my hike yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, me and hike don't happen in the same
sense a lot, but I could teach you some
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lindsay seems to be really good at
forgetting a fire source.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's what us tumor ridden fucks are
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've always got seven bicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can find a way to get that nail hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should always have, if you're going
to be dabbing and you're on the go and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going somewhere to dab,
somebody take a can of butane.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no idea how many times
everybody's had everything we've needed to
[SPEAKER_04]: take dabs and nobody had any butane.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm the guy with the can of butane in
my backpack.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, I'll treat you guys a fat dab
for this butane.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get the next dab that comes out of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as that torch is filled,
guess who gets a dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I had the butane to save the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's the boy scout in me
or the smoker or the stoner, but I've
[SPEAKER_03]: always got a couple of lighters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I'm going to go dab somewhere,
I like a can of butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two torches, two nails, two rigs,
because rigs get dropped, nails get lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all sorts of weird shit happens and
it ruins the session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh dude, we could all be high right now,
but we forgot a part and our weeds fancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're sober.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay texted me one night.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, dude, I'm somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to smoke some hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a rig and no torch?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had a rig and I had no torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we say rig and it sounds terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: By a rig, we mean a small water pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer a smaller, I went over this on
another episode, a small pipe with a dab
[SPEAKER_04]: nail on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go domeless nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of us use what's called a banger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quartz hash nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a little quartz hash bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's fucking marvelous.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Lindsay had the pipe and the nail
part, but she didn't have a way to make
[SPEAKER_04]: the nail part hot to where she could melt
hash on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember my advice, Lindsay,
the way that I really thought would work
[SPEAKER_04]: for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me two that I thought were
actually quite, so you gave me the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: stove, which had- Electric stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, it would have worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the damn stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then- Just take the nail out and heat
the nail on the stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot knife that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one was the car- The car
cigarette lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told her to use the car cigarette
lighter as a carb cap on the banger.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just heat that fucker up till it
glows and then you drop your dab in the
[SPEAKER_04]: banger and then put the cigarette lighter
over it and draw, the heat would work just
[SPEAKER_04]: like how the carb cap works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she didn't try it because she didn't
have the fucking cigarette lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine doesn't work in my car, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so if you're screwed and you got a
banger, you could probably take a dab by
[SPEAKER_04]: using that cigarette lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also- I know a little dude that-
Well, that's what the nail in the rig is
[SPEAKER_03]: for, is it replaces hot knife hits in the
world of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a fancy hot knife.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hot knife hits is exactly what it
sounds like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take two butter knives, you stick them
in an electric stove until the tips glow,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then mash a piece of hash in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how everyone in Europe got stoned
from 71 to 75.
[SPEAKER_04]: Used to smoke hash like that in my buddy
Sam's fucking kitchen years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Sammy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: When people my parents' age come into the
shop and ask for hash, what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking about is hot knife hits or the
little pin under the beer mug hash hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even believe that what we have
now is hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally explain it as this is the new
fancy hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my intro sentence for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the easiest way to bring them up to
speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, hot knife hits work on the fancy
hash too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a little closer to crack smoke
than most of us likes to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: One time I saw our buddy Kevin took his
car cigarette lighter and took a dab and
[SPEAKER_04]: just threw the dab on the car cigarette
lighter and inhaled what came off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's portable and functional.
It worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It fucking worked for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easily hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just put it right back in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably never worked again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get that far.
[SPEAKER_04]: One time we were at a party late one night
and we were smoking a bowl and we had
[SPEAKER_04]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was before like, Kevin and I were
kind of, we were some of the first dab
[SPEAKER_04]: kids around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone was smoking weed at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin was making shatter out of the
material I was growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were kind of ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd go places and people wouldn't have
a rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't used to drive around with a
rig on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't take glass with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't do any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like taking a rig with me
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we would get a bowl burning real hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get it super ridiculous, charried,
and then just drop globs of hash onto it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then try to smoke as much of that as
we could.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would make us choke so hard,
but we would get high as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did so much bizarre shit back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The swing arm skillets where we'd have
them glow in like the sun and then throw a
[SPEAKER_03]: quarter gram dab down because we didn't
know anything about what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day we thought red was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that oil would just fly out onto your
legs and shit while you were hitting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boiling tap, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my buddy Jordan Segoto.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day we were dabbing and he heated the
banger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what he was thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grabbed a fat dab and just heats the
banger, sets the torch down, and just puts
[SPEAKER_04]: the dab on the nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually you got to wait at least a few
seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these new kids are setting a
fucking timer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got a little fucking hourglass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, come on, you can wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, Jordan just goes right in.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just goes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was probably 15 feet away from him
sitting in another chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could hear the dab scream.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dab went... And we could all hear it
from across the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that dude turned to purple and red and
tons of different colors and cough
[SPEAKER_04]: forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That poor dude took the hottest dab ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit was terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glowy, glowy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first generation of dab kids have some
of the best little burn and brand marks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's your dab wound?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got two drip wounds on one of my legs
from the skillet days.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you can't really tell what they're
dab related unless you get explained and
[SPEAKER_03]: then the stripe makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember seeing kids, when domeless
nails first started being notched a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit, sort of like castle towers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Walmart or some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a kid reached out with some money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw on his forearm that he had that
brand mark on his wrist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just fucking busted up laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a whole bunch of the circular
domeless nails.
[SPEAKER_03]: The domeless nail burns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the dome days, people had all
sorts of crazy drip burns.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't let your friends try to
carb the dab rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't pull that hot nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just heated it with the torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't carb it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to burn.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to carb it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just smoke, it'll quit smoking when
it's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine, he was being handed a
rig and the person almost dropped it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he reached out reflexively and grabbed
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the heat sinks in the top of the neck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the nail lined up in between his thumb
and forefinger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the brand right there looks like half
space alieny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because of the way the bowl pressed
into his hand and then the heat sinks
[SPEAKER_03]: below it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The little metal stripes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was hideous, but now the brand
looks cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the plus side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to a positive note,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This place is going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what dads do to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new thing is to take some good shatter
or some good hash of any kind,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then dunk it into fresh terpenes,
either from blue, blue, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Words are hard at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue river.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or of course our friends at Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think dunking the dabs and terps kind of
pushes it to a whole new level.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ghost drain haze dabs make my eyes
vibrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemon G dabs make my head spin a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the OG Kush dabs just make me want to
lay down and chill the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The terps, the terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these new terps, are definitely the
next level.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if you have the opportunity,
come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find a store that sells terps
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a dab of shatter on a dabber and dunk
it into the container of terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that onto a properly temperature nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carb cap it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come see us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be awesome to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take a hike with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take a dab with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're volunteering.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going for 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are getting ADD.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people at the table are super high and
they're getting really quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it feels like it's time to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This show, Mike, you look good and high.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I'm thinking about terps now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just distracted and now I remember
those are over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for a dunk and dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for a dunk and dab nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds way worse than it's going to
be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, shout out your Twitter handle so
that folks can follow you and also remind
[SPEAKER_04]: them of your Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter and Pueblo
for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay, that's a killer stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's inspiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making me want to stretch and get
an inch taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even talk after it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like you had a stroke almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind everybody how they can follow you
on all the social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the Traveling Stoner on Instagram and
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Snapchat is Traveling Stoner without
the G and my Twitter is the Travel Stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and Facebook is the Traveling Stoner
too, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking about your website?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go there yet.
