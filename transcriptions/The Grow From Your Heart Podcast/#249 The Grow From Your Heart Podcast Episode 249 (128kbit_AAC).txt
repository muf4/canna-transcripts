[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 249 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: for letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, remember last week I
was complaining about it raining for a
[SPEAKER_01]: solid week?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to upgrade my complaint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been raining for two solid weeks
here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an outdoor grower here in the
southern Colorado area, the struggle is
[SPEAKER_01]: real this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know where there's no struggle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here at this dab table, right here
at this recording area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am smoking some flow wax from our
friends at Concentrate Supply Company,
[SPEAKER_01]: grown at Three Rivers, of course,
where I'm the lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know me, you know that I've got
sort of a love-hate relationship with the
[SPEAKER_01]: flow plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing flow for probably 10
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first or second legal medical marijuana
grow contained flow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how long I've been growing flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a gift from a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took it to the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I flowered some out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had this flow plant around for
probably 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say I've got a love-hate relationship
with flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a very unique smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I love hate, is the unique
smell of flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of flow smells amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of flow smells terrible to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of depends on how it comes
out and what part of the flowering period
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: One point, it smells great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it turns into this thing that I do
not like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it could be because I grew it for
so long that I would wake up in my house,
[SPEAKER_01]: my entire house, would smell like flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go to bed and my entire house
would smell like flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would leave and pull up into the
driveway and when I got out of the car,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first thing I would smell would be
flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are like, yeah,
big problems, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes that same smell forever,
that shit gets on your nerves and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to not smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't get away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had like a love-hate relationship
with flow and I would refuse to smoke it
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll grow the shit out of some flow
because I grow for a dispensary and people
[SPEAKER_01]: buy the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to have the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But flow is not my favorite to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I was at the dispensary and I
grew this material and they said,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we turned some of the flow into wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to smell it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put my nose in the little jar I'm
doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mouth just went, yeah, I'll take a
gram of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did an episode called Follow Your
Nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was totally correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smelled this, I wanted some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I got home and dabbed it,
I said to myself, you should have bought
[SPEAKER_01]: more of that because it's got a really
great high to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of mellowed me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of dabs make me super rambly and
super chatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds like I'm rambly and
chatty right now because I'm doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast by myself and I'm the only one
here to talk and I'm explaining how I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do sound rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my thoughts are much slower,
much more controlled than it would be had
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked some Jack Flash or Platinum Tangy
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits a pretty damn good high off this
Flow Wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting down on my chair nice and
mellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some solid notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of de-scrambled the eggs in my
brain that get scrambled sometimes when I
[SPEAKER_01]: take too big of a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great job to my friends at CSC for the
great work on the Flow and also a big
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to all of the growers at Three
Rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am the lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am tooting my own horn a little bit,
but I am just the lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other guys there that do a lot
of hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do get hot and sweaty, but these other
guys, they bust their asses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the entire Grow team at
Three Rivers and big shout out to our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends at Concentrate Supply Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the trimmers are included in
all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody from the Grow staff to the
trimmers to the metric folk to the
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: at Three Rivers and of course at CSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I believe it was CSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not certain, but one of the
concentrate companies sent us an email
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that our material yielded the most
concentrate that they have ever gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: from a batch of materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing something right at Three
Rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing something right over at CSC
Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Flow is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also digging the Cindy Walker,
which is Cindy 99 with White Walker in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also got some blueberry headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great work, but I'm loving the Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Flow is, you know, I think this batch
of Flow may have restored my faith and my
[SPEAKER_01]: fascination with Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be back on the Flow train.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might smoke some more Flow more
frequently now that I've tried this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about something else that's
cool from the Grow at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to lab test everything that we
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that we grow is tested for
potency and it's also tested for molds and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we send everything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it can be sold at the store,
it all has to be sent out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it all has to be tested and the
results have to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The test results for some of our strains
have come back pretty impressive lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to brag about our 31% THC test
result on Presidential Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not breed the Presidential Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not my project of breeding,
but we did grow it and we tested at 31%
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty proud of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty good number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most strains that you're going to find in
a dispensary, they hover somewhere between
[SPEAKER_01]: the 22 to like 29 is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: 27 is kind of where you're going to find
them mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 to 27 in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get over 30, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: 31 is super impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest that we have seen is 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever seen a higher
test, which was of course the Arise that
[SPEAKER_01]: tested at 35 in a fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was grown at Organica.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was bred by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I just wanted to brag on our
whole crew and our genetics and the Janey
[SPEAKER_01]: tech that we're using over at Three
Rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got an official lab result at 31.6%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back in the day, we got a test
from our ecto cooler strain that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: little higher than that, but everybody
thought that it was a fluke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody kind of dismissed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just going to celebrate the 31%.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take this 31.6 seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to brag about this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big shout out to everybody at Three
Rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, what do I want to touch on
next?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I got to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to remind you that this podcast is
brought to you by our friends at The Dank
[SPEAKER_01]: Team.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to add some new genetics to
your lineup, if you need some regular or
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds, check out my friends at
thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thedankteam.com carries brands like Alpha
Chronic, Mile High, Sin City, Canaventure,
[SPEAKER_01]: iReGenetics, the Cali Connection,
DNA Genetics, and many more trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you check out thedankteam.com
and let them know you're listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of new seeds, let's talk about my
most current breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the first of this month, I started a
new breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a few plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running one light in a very small room
with a very small amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a Rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two different phenotypes of a
Rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Rise number E and a Rise number 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an Ectocooler in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Strawberry Fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Zac Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, HellzOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in the breeding room together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going to get hit with pollen
from my Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Arise male is known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made Chem 4 seeds before with
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only made about 30 of those,
so I never let any of those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Rise E and a Rise 8, of course,
will make a Rise F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ectocooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never bred the Ectocooler to the
Arise before.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm thinking is going to happen is
we're going to get really tall,
[SPEAKER_01]: really dense, really stinky, really
resin-covered buds with a very unique
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ectocooler has a very unique flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Arise has its own pungent smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you mix the two, we're going
to find some great progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Strawberry Fields is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry Fields has a very strawberry
candy-like kind of smell, kind of a soft
[SPEAKER_01]: hint of a strawberry incense sort of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll create some really tall,
tropical-flavored strawberry-type Sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kosher Kush is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kosher Kush from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great cut of Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal with the Kosher Kush cross,
the Kosher doesn't put out a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces a bunch of really small buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping maybe we can increase the
yields on the Kosher Kush, maybe put a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more funk into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kosher's already a great strain,
but I think adding it to Arise,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to increase the production,
just making an overall plant altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow makes, when you cross Flow to Arise,
that makes a strain called Prana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prana is an Indica-Sativa hybrid with a
very unique aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smells that come out of that plant are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces big, fat, chunky colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you cross Grateful Dog to an Arise
male, that creates a plant called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Morning Dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morning Dew is as close to Grateful Dog as
I have released in regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago, I released Grateful Dog
in Feminine Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It quickly became very popular,
but I quickly sold out because I am not
[SPEAKER_01]: making more Feminine Seeds for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no plan in my future to make
Feminine Seeds, so that Morning Dew was as
[SPEAKER_01]: close to the Grateful Dog that I have put
out in a regular seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have on the list here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Zac Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you about Zac Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zac Hayes is strawberry cough crossed to
Killer Queen, and it was made for our
[SPEAKER_01]: friend Zac Hayes from New Mexico,
who was part of the Organica dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zac Hayes unfortunately passed of cystic
fibrosis, so he had a strain named after
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long live Zac.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cross the Arise to Zac Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, I can get those available for
you at Organica and Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a medical marijuana patient,
or if you knew Zac, there will be a way
[SPEAKER_01]: for you to get your hands on the Zac Hayes
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up to Zac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss you little buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Bitch is my cross of Grateful Dog to
Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took my favorite Space Queen female,
and I pollinated it with the Grateful Dog
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminized Pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was made years and years ago,
and I never released it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept this one to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically, almost every plant that I
grew from there came out very similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like I just made a Space Queen
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't show much Grateful Dog in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to kind of mix that weird mango
funky flavor that Space Queen creates with
[SPEAKER_01]: that gassy funky tropical thing that Arise
has, and I'm really curious what that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Space Queen stays short and squat,
or the Space Bitch stays short and squat
[SPEAKER_01]: and branches out a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise likes to grow real tall and is real
branchy, so I may have created a beefy-ass
[SPEAKER_01]: plant with a bunch of stink.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have crossed Hell's OG to Arise before,
and that makes a strain called Hellfire
[SPEAKER_01]: OG, since it starts off with an OG Kush as
a mother that female puts that really,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just gets a lot of the Hell's OG fuel
and funk and dakeness, and then you put
[SPEAKER_01]: the Arise in there, which is Golden Goat
and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm going to go back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph OG,
so I'm putting Chem D, Joseph OG,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Golden Goat to another Kush plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bringing out a lot of great cushy
undertones, and some have a lemon Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are real greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have a smell of lemon pledge with
Kush on it, and then some have a weird,
[SPEAKER_01]: it reminds me of lava soap or some kind of
soap that I can't quite put my nose on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's got a great aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal was the Hell's OG does not produce
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a tall, lanky, skinny,
shitty plant like a lot of OGs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Arise is just a stocky,
really robust plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that breeds to that comes out
with more production, so I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the production, increase the
structure of the Hell's OG, and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's in the breeding project
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those will, of course, be hit by
the Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only seven or eight days into
flower right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need about 21 to 25 days to get into
bloom before I'll hit them with pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from there, they're going to need
five to eight weeks for those seeds to
[SPEAKER_01]: harden up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go pull seeds occasionally from
certain plants and see if they look like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flow finishes really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds come on quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, the Hell's OG,
those seeds seem to take a really long
[SPEAKER_01]: time to harden up, so it's all about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about timing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about having a goal, and it's all
about paying attention to what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to breed, have a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just throw some plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have an idea of what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you want to create.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that's a look into my breeding
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we want to move on to next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read a message from a listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listened to the episode last week,
I talked about how to talk about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: with your kids, how to address your
cannabis use with your children.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you live in places where dare is
trying to set your kids up to snitch on
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you hide your cannabis
use, it looks like you're up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you talk to your kids about it
and tell them what's going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have built an honest relationship with
your family, and there's no reason to hide
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hide things, it makes you look
like you're hiding something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be acting just a little bit
differently because you're hiding
[SPEAKER_01]: something, and the kids are so receptive
that they're going to see you acting
[SPEAKER_01]: differently, and they're going to know
you're hiding something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hide shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't lie to the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hide things, you have to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you lie, you have to lie again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to hide that lie,
and then you got to lie again,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just a fucking shitty web,
and you don't want to start that with your
[SPEAKER_01]: children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell the children the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, a listener sent me an email,
and I don't know if they want their name
[SPEAKER_01]: set on the air, so I'm going to keep that
private, but he knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, bro, we need to sesh soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're kind of far from me,
but we do need to get together and sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, brother, great work on the drum
videos on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you playing the drum videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a drummer too, so we need to get
together and sesh and play a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you bringing your drum kit to me,
or am I bringing my drum kit to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's get into this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for making people aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: this video, and I'll see you in the next
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the message, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we get to sesh sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can meet up in the springs or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've got another message I want
to read that came from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alcohol is terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceuticals are terrible, and
cigarettes are the devil, so I'm proud of
[SPEAKER_01]: you for quitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, I'm glad I'm helping you grow
good cannabis to get away from that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and take better care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message keeps going, and it says like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That still means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, consider this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I digress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high on some homegrown Jack Herrera
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish Jack had a higher CBD content,
as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it to be a wonderful medicine in
certain areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever bred with Jack?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't bred with Jack, but I've bred
with Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown the seeds out yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he goes on to say, or can you
recommend a strain very similar to Jack,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with a heavier CBD medical side?
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly respect your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm reaching out to you
directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much conflicting info out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let Jesse know that his simple act of
liking a few of my photos gave me a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence that I'm doing something right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's pretty cool that Jesse likes
your photos on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are definitely doing something right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as for conflicting information,
that's why I do this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to write a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that a book would evolve almost
every week in the new cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also knew that there was a
bunch of bullshit out there on the forums
[SPEAKER_01]: that was making people ruin their grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to put out a way to teach
people how to grow with, just like you
[SPEAKER_01]: said in the beginning, with no bullshit,
with no jokes, with no tricks,
[SPEAKER_01]: with tried and true methods that actually
work in home grows and large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for the compliments there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about strains that are
similar to Jack, but are a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: higher in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a strain that may surprise people that
often has a lot of CBD in it is Alaskan
[SPEAKER_01]: Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaskan Thunderfuck is thought of as a
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows really tall, reaching colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has like a really nice minty sandalwood
sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on where you get it and
who grew it, but it acts more like a
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have seen test results from Alaskan
Thunderfuck that have tested with
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive CBD numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another strain I think you may like,
maybe Pennywise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennywise is a kind of a sativa growing
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice sativa high, but it's also
got plenty of CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now another really popular high CBD strain
is ACDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: ACDC has a lot of CBD, but it's also got
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to give you a nice head buzz,
but you're also going to get that relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get bogged down.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of other really popular CBD
crosses are Harlequin and Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find those quite often in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if they are available in your
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the strains I listed are available
in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably find some of them at
thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't guarantee what they've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I have noticed is in my
opinion, CBD works better as an edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it to be more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking CBD comes on quickly, but it
doesn't last very long in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something you might want to
consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep growing the jack, keep smoking the
jack, but maybe add a little bit of CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: edible or CBD tincture to your regimen,
and that may be the way to go to help with
[SPEAKER_01]: the relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go extreme and grow a plant
that is really heavy in CBD and won't do
[SPEAKER_01]: much on the THC side, I would recommend
Tora Bora from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the best plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not produce very well,
but it does put out very good CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have a nice cherry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have kind of a cushy aroma,
and the CBD effects are very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Tora Bora from DNA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I want to thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said not to say your name,
but hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go follow you on Instagram
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to know if you find some
medicine that works a little bit better
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to send
me a message, the best way to do it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: email me at growfromyourheartathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to read your messages on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into one more email before we
wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just started listening to your podcast and
I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for doing the podcast for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes on to say, I listened to
your Sea of Green episode and got some
[SPEAKER_01]: great info.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm planning on using the Scrog tech since
my space is very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recall you saying that you use this
method as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear another more in-depth
episode on your methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot size, transplant before a flower,
and plants per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm planning on growing Cindy 99 using the
True Living Organics Method, the Revcell
[SPEAKER_01]: C99F4 that he says work good with this
growing method.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should work pretty well in that
method, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any tips for small, grow spaces,
thanks, and keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not going to do a whole long
episode on Scrogging again because I kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of covered most of it in that first
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get right to the point with your
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you want to know more about pot
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since you're doing a small area,
you actually included your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that it's two by three and a half
by eight, so you've got two feet wide,
[SPEAKER_01]: three and a half feet deep, and eight feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a lot of space to work with,
but that's plenty of space for a small
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got a 400 watt light in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you've got some airflow in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've got a 600 watt light with a
whole lot of airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's up to you, but pot size in a space
that small, I would probably do two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three three gallon pots and just spread
them out really far, or maybe do one five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pot if it even fits in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a tight fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get those square pots,
one five gallon pot in there would fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spread it down real, real low and just
keep that plant as short as you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time it grows up, bend it back under
that trellis net and keep it low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing you can do if you want to go
smaller pots, you can do more plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller pots and you don't have to veg as
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with more plants is you have
less veg time.
[SPEAKER_01]: With less plants, it takes more veg time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just going to grow one plant longer
to fill the space, or you'll grow more
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for shorter to fill the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do rock wool cubes,
do the four inch rock wool cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe do one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do maybe 16 rock wool cubes in the whole
room, or maybe do 12 or nine four inch
[SPEAKER_01]: square pots or nine six inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how often you want to water,
how many plants you want to run,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many plants are you legally allowed to
run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this an illegal grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things like that to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your space, I would say two or three
three gallon pots or a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: little ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transplant before a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, just put them into the three
gallon pots or maybe one five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a good aerated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a quality soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's kind of up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying earlier, if you want to
do a whole bunch of little ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could do 30 little tiny rock wool
cubes, or you could do 16 bigger rock wool
[SPEAKER_01]: cubes, or nine six inch net pots,
or three three gallon pots, or one five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pot, or maybe one seven gallon pot
would fit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this is going to do is it's going to
make a difference on how frequently you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make a difference on how
long you have to veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to make a difference on how
many plants you have in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some of the things to consider
when you're deciding this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I may have kind of just
told you figure it out, but you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: have to figure this part out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you're going to have to
decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to veg longer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to veg shorter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want one big plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want multiple strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the fun parts about cannabis
is that you have a little wiggle room.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no solid rules on what you've
got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what I would probably do,
I'm looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to picture this size of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would do four three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be sure to do all the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would grow them up about like until they
have a few nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when they start making that node
where the one starts taking off at the
[SPEAKER_01]: top, I would top them, take that main top
node out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got a nice even plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start trellising them out then and
spread them out real wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got four plants that are
probably like 10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nice and bushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them under the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that screen set up about 10 or 12
inches above the top of the pot and just
[SPEAKER_01]: start spreading them out as wide as you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of letting that plant grow up,
make it grow out and then let it grow up
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you have another screen up,
you can use the next screen to support all
[SPEAKER_01]: the buds that you're going to create
because they'll start falling over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the next one as like little supports
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they start tipping, you just have
this little, little rows of buds
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope I gave you useful information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just told you figure it out,
do what you feel best with, but I would do
[SPEAKER_01]: four three gallon pots and put the net
about 10 or 12 inches above the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use four of the same strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let those plants grow all into that net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep bending them down, bending them down,
keeping them low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some go and pop and twist the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a little bit of super cropping in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure those sticks are nice and
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them move the nutrients around real
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you've got that screen
filled in, let it grow straight up just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and then flip it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you will be completely happy
with your results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I know I left a whole bunch of
wiggle room in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't give any steadfast answers,
but this is some stuff that you get to
[SPEAKER_01]: play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say I do the four pots, three
gallons, run those Cindy 99s in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these seeds feminized or are they
regular?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are F4 as it says here,
they're probably regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plan on pulling out some males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is possible for you, however many
seeds you've got, grow all of them in that
[SPEAKER_01]: space in small pots, put them in a six
inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a 10 pack, run all 10 of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they get big enough to take a clone,
take a clone from every one of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: label it like make plant A, plant A,
plant B, plant B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go label all your plants and then take a
clone and label that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant A, clone A, plant B, clone B and
then grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find some boys,
throw the boys away, throw the
[SPEAKER_01]: corresponding clones away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got a bunch of girls to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finish those girls, find the one you like
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a clone of that over there in
the cloner or hopefully it's in a pot by
[SPEAKER_01]: now and rooted, but you've got a clone of
the good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can grow as many of that as you
want next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe start with a whole bunch of small
pots, find the one you want and then run
[SPEAKER_01]: four clones of that one in three gallon
pots next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be the strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've got room to keep
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you have room to keep
that, the good one as a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what your options are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you've got very limited
space, but if you can dedicate another
[SPEAKER_01]: very small space to keeping a clone and
one keeper mother plant, you would have
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself a small perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you didn't say if you want me
to use your name or not on the episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm going to be respectful and not say
your name, but hey, thanks for the great
[SPEAKER_01]: email.
