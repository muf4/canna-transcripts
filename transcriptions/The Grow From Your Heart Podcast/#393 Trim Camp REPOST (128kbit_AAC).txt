[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous dab of Mandarin
Sunset from Contraband Extracts available
[SPEAKER_00]: at a cut above in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate has a great aroma and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sweet, orange and candy with a hint
of pepper and spice at the back end and
[SPEAKER_00]: the high is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes straight to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes straight behind my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of makes it hard to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it hard to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is exactly what I'm looking for
in a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to our friends at Contraband
Extracts and a big shout out to everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: at a cut above.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been following along with the
podcast, you know I've been doing a long
[SPEAKER_00]: series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is going to be a reposted
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: A while back, I did an episode about
trimming our freshly harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was originally posted as episode 327.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls right in line with our grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to repost it as episode 393.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody enjoys this repost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, let's jump right in
to trimming our freshly harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bong or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 327 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the episode off
by letting you know what I'm smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of this New York City
Diesel Ambrosia batter from Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a nice smell right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff smells like like diesel fuel
with a little bit of lemons, maybe a hint
[SPEAKER_00]: of oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's kind of a sweet tart sort
of smell on top of it that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about the New York City Diesel
Ambrosia batter here that I'm smoking on,
[SPEAKER_00]: my eyes really don't get red when I smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke and I don't get red eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I take one dab of this New York
City Diesel, my eyes go fully bloodshot
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what does it, but I get super
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get super head hide from it and I really
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that weren't enough, I've been
adding this sour amnesia high cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract into the mix and it
just adds a really nice, it's like turbo
[SPEAKER_00]: charging my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the lung expansion and the flavor
from the New York City Diesel and you put
[SPEAKER_00]: the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
on top and it really makes it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: turbocharged dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in the mood for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I feel super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be all about
trimming your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to tell when the plants
are ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned how to hang them until they're
ready to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know pretty well how to dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about trimming our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are two different ways you can
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's wet trim and there is dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely prefer dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to say, why is dry trim
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think dry trim is better because it's
less sticky and it's much easier to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also less work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are going to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is just brush them with
your thumb, maybe touch them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors and those brittle leaves will
come right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds have dried and tightened up and
it's a little more obvious for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmer what to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to take off that fluffy,
outside shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little less work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less sticky and there's also less
chance to ruin your buds by improperly
[SPEAKER_00]: storing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, once the buds are
trimmed, if they wet trim, they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: just shove them into a container or a
package and then those wet buds go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: container and that's when they get ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not even going to let that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to let the buds dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to trim them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll put them in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of people have listened to the
dry and curing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be trimming these buds before they
go into the jar for cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be trimming these buds after
they've been in the cure jar for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves should be similar in dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should just be popping right off of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not even need scissors for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I'm dry trimming,
the only thing I use my scissors for is
[SPEAKER_00]: for cutting the plant into smaller pieces
and cutting the sticks out and cutting the
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger buds down to smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about a few preparations we
can make and a few items we can have to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a comfortable and successful trim
environment for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimming sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sitting in a chair with your elbows
up high staring straight into something
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your neck, your elbows, your eyes,
your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff all gets sore and tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to make it as comfortable as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have a nice clean space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this table where I like to do my
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean the whole table off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing on the table except my Dr.
Pepper and some trim supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe my phone for some entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just there for music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be touching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have your phone out if you're
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it's so fucking distracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will slow you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take twice as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on a podcast, hit play, start fucking
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I like to have the table nice and
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need shit in my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need maybe my scissors for cutting my
buds into smaller pieces and then just a
[SPEAKER_00]: few basic essentials and we'll talk about
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice clean space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like a nice comfortable chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be sitting there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a cozy chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a nice clean workspace and a cozy chair
are super important for me for trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you need some sort of
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you got somebody there to talk
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I got Mike or somebody around to
bullshit with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sort of conversation makes trimming
go much more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have that option,
put on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I like to put on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I recommend old episodes of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to entertain yourself to listen
to, but nothing to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we used to trim all
around the TV and we would watch YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: videos and trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that that is super distracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't watch videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will put their fucking scissors
down and you'll catch them just watching
[SPEAKER_00]: TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're paying people to trim,
don't have a TV in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcasts, maybe some stand-up comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get everybody on the same
page when it comes to music, but maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: play some good music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some sort of stuff to make it
comfortable and help the time pass without
[SPEAKER_00]: your brain going crazy is what I'm getting
at, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a clean space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a chair to sit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a good YouTube video on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a podcast going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're cozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mind is entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some rubber gloves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to wear gloves when you're
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get extremely sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have to itch your face
and have to go wash your hands just to
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hands are going to be covered in
trichomes and resin, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need some good scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the little tiny Fiskars diamond tip
scissors that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expensive at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheaper at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them in the craft section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, the craft section at Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all of Hobby Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them in the fabric section over
by the fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Fiskars diamond tip titanium
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work really well for trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get something with a spring in it that
opens on its own because you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be open and closing scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the kind of scissors that
have loops that go around your fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to be cutting for so
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those little loops around your fingers are
going to dig into you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want lightweight, super fast
trimming shears.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to find and they're
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get yourselves two pair so that you
can set one in the rubbing alcohol to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dirty up another pair,
swap them out real quick and not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend a lot of time cleaning your
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need some good gloves, some good
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need some containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a container for untrimmed buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend a five gallon bucket for the
untrimmed buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have that much herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something smaller will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need another container for
trimmed buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need another container for
saveable trim and then we need another
[SPEAKER_00]: container for waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need trimmed buds, untrimmed buds,
usable trim and waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple other things I'm going to
recommend and you're going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: why the hell would he recommend this for a
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend either some coconut oil
or some baby oil for your trim session.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to say, why do we need that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your fingers and hands and arms get
all sticky, you can use the coconut oil or
[SPEAKER_00]: the baby oil to remove the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if your hands are all
covered in resin, my thing is that my arms
[SPEAKER_00]: get covered in resin because I'm the one
cutting down the plants and reaching in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and playing with them and carrying
them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arm hair and shit gets all coated in
trichomes and plant resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the coconut oil or baby oil to
just rub up on my arms and rub that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: right off and all the resin comes right
off and then you're not all sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's a basic breakdown of
things that you're going to need for your
[SPEAKER_00]: trim session.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a nice clean space in which to
work you need a nice cozy chair in which
[SPEAKER_00]: to sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good podcast to listen to,
probably the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need your containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your cleanup supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about doing the manual
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, a few days before harvest,
you went in and did a pre-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I mean by that is while the
plants are still alive, while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing, anywhere between, I don't know,
seven days before harvest up to the day of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, you can go in there and just
start pulling off all of the big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are done growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just flushing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just finishing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are ripening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need all that excess leaf in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go ahead and tear all that leaf
out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a pre-harvest defoliation session
will save you a lot of time when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: time to trim because all of that long
straggly leaf is already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even there to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been removed and it will also
help your drying and curing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in and pull off all the big leaves
before you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a highly detailed harvest
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't listened to that,
go listen to that, then come catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the harvest episode,
we're left with our plants hanging upside
[SPEAKER_00]: down in a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want those plants to get to where
the sticks snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the sticks get snappy, you can start
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also start trimming them after
they've been in their cure containers for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just waiting for the buds to be dry
enough to where the leaves kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: flake right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still going to be moisture inside
those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's moisture in the middle,
but the outside is dry enough to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can just kind of knock the buds off,
the leaves off the buds with your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making a little motion with my hands
that sort of looks like I'm playing a
[SPEAKER_00]: video game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a game controller in my hand,
but my hands are really close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, I'm just holding that little
bud with my forefingers, or maybe with my
[SPEAKER_00]: left hand, and I'm just knocking the
leaves off with my right hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I'm playing a video game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just holding the bud and just rubbing
the leaves right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hold it with the bud facing up,
if you rub down, those leaves will just
[SPEAKER_00]: rub right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see what I'm talking about when you
figure out the technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, man, that is so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is that I want it to where the
buds are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to just knock those
leaves right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is how I actually do my trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I'm working with the plants,
I like to wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one of trimming is put on some rubber
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the six millimeter nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if they're black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if they're blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just care that they fit and that they're
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glove up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get all sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I don't want to get my skin all over
the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one is glove up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step two of trimming is to knock all of
the buds off of the sticks into a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go and get every bud off the sticks
into a bucket and then discard all the
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've compressed your work into a
much smaller space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks way less overwhelming and you can
see what you've got ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a five gallon bucket filled
with buds that you need to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like this big sprawl of
branches and leaves and shit everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way less intimidating and you can get
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knock all the buds into a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can use just a small bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can use something smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much you grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need five buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you need 10 or 25 gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But find the container that's the right
size for what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: A five gallon bucket from Home Depot or
Lowe's is really affordable and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to use the buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knock every bud into a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got a five gallon bucket full of
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next step is just to reach in,
grab the bud off the top and start
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll actually start talking about
trimming a little bit and the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming of the bud process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to knock or cut off all of the
excessive leaves and stems and give
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself a nice pretty presentable bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know what a good trimmed bud
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start off they're covered in
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our job to knock those leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to smoke leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves contain chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves don't get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want is a nice frosty green
nugget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you guys get started trimming
you'll see what's leaf material and what
[SPEAKER_00]: is a usable bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start digging in there and just
start knocking off some of the leaf you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: find that bud in the middle and it will
start to become very obvious what you do
[SPEAKER_00]: and do not trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your buds are kind of airy and fluffy
don't trim too deeply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just knock off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grab the bud by the base by that
little stick at the bottom of the bud and
[SPEAKER_00]: just use my thumb to push the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of spin the bud in a circle
with my left hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking that's counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: No that is clockwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn the bud clockwise and as it
comes toward me I'll use my right thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using my left hand to spin the bud
toward me and as that one side comes
[SPEAKER_00]: toward me my thumb just knocks the leaves
off right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wiping them off like I'm just
scraping the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so dry that they knock off on
their own and don't press so hard that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fucking up the shape of the bud and
knocking off trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this really gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find the technique after you do it
a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really comfortable and you'll get
really fast at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to do this with
scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hold it in their left hand and
they'll take their scissors and just turn
[SPEAKER_00]: it and trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are sticking off horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep your scissors horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust your angle as you need and
just spin that bud and keep cutting just
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're giving it a haircut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to take off those leaves and
leave that bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just knock off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't carve too deeply into the buds and
don't squish the buds while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't squeeze them super hard and try not
to handle them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little tiny bud doesn't need a lot of
handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get all those trichomes
on your gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to leave the trichomes on the
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use scissors if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my thumbs for most trimming you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little edge of my thumb and my
thumbnail is a perfect little trimmer for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mastered that technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knock off the little leaves and cut the
big buds into smaller sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys can see a stick in there and
it's like one bud and then a little stick
[SPEAKER_00]: and another bud, take that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to buy a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connoisseur quality bud is taken down to
the small part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to leave your buds in big
buds, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't want to buy a big
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have some customers that want big
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have people that just wanted big
buds and then some people know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, man, I don't want to buy
that quarter, that one bud that weighs a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter because I know right up the middle
of it is a gram of stick and I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people want it, some people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got it trimmed up to the
size you want it and the amount of trim
[SPEAKER_00]: you want, I cut off all the little leaves
at the bottom also.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people leave little cabbage-y
looking leaves at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut that shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also take out the handlebar sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom, you're going to have the
branch that the bud was actually stuck to
[SPEAKER_00]: the branch to and then there's two little
sticks that come out that those first
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves were attached to and they're all
dry and shitty looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut those off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a pound of weed and you've
got all those little tiny sticks in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: those little sticks make your pound look
like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take it out and your pound is going
to look so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so much more desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get you more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim it and it's worth more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take off all the leaves, take off that
little stick at the bottom, knock off all
[SPEAKER_00]: the crow's feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a little tiny pointy leaf
sticking out of somewhere, cut that out or
[SPEAKER_00]: knock it off with your thumb, those little
triangle leaves make you look lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did a whole good job on most of the
bud and you just left one or two little
[SPEAKER_00]: triangles at the tip, you look lazy,
take that stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I'm doing this, all the trimming
work, I trim over a tray or a container to
[SPEAKER_00]: catch what I trim off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that little stuff that gets clipped
off is going to be used to make
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates or edibles in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gather all that stuff up, take care of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just, don't trim into the floor and
then sweep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't trim onto the table and then scoop
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim onto a tray, trim into a container so
that it is kept clean so it's treated with
[SPEAKER_00]: respect because it may go into edibles and
things that you're going to eat need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: treated with respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things you're going to smoke need to be
treated with respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gather this stuff up and vacuum seal
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep the trim in a vacuum sealed
bag in the dark until I'm able to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that to your extractor as soon as you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sticks, those are thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw all the sticks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, they're thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, those should go to the
compost pile or they could be burned or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, but the sticks are trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to extract sticks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a waste of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get anything out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you're adding the sticks to
the trim, you're just making the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not making it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What goes in comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just put shit in to make more,
you're going to get more, but it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gather up all your trim, vacuum seal
the trim, keep the trim in a dark place
[SPEAKER_00]: and get that to somebody that can turn
that into concentrates for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got like yellow or brown
or funky leaves that are falling off as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trimming, separate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull those out of the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send that to the extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make your hash dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make your hash taste like
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make it less potent and it's
going to make it less desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do a little work, clean it up,
get it out of there and you will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use your thumbs or some scissors to
gently remove the excess leaves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: little stems from the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of the handlebars, get rid of the
crow's feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once the buds are trimmed to your
satisfaction, you can place them into a
[SPEAKER_00]: container for finished products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I say to your satisfaction,
how you want to trim your buds is up to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to leave it a little fluffy,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to trim it nice and tight,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your product is for you personally,
then you can leave it as leafy as you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can knock those leaves off right
before you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean it up yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on getting top dollar for your
product, you'll need to have a tight,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean trim job.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention that will help
us speed up the process of trimming is the
[SPEAKER_00]: rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bud you are trimming is not bigger
than the tip of your thumb, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: better to let that bud go to your hash
pile and trim something more substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put those little popcorn buds in the hash
pile, put it in your trim pile and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make better hash that will improve the
quality of your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a little tiny bud, don't waste
time trimming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw it in the hash pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't waste your time trimming little
tiny buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like that little tiny bud is
worth less money than the time it is
[SPEAKER_00]: taking you to trim it, set it aside and
put it in the hash pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to trim that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If herb costs $10 a gram and it takes you
like a minute to trim that little nug,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So toss that little nug into the trim bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll add that to the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab something that we can trim and get on
the shelf and make it purchasable for the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's real tiny, if it's ugly,
don't bother trimming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put that in your hash pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add that to the to be extracted
pile and that will just improve your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also speed you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you need every little half
gram, every piece of gravel out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to make your goal, to make your
weight, go ahead and trim that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be weight in the bottom of the
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not necessary, if it's just
for you, put that in the concentrate pile
[SPEAKER_00]: and speed yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, the growers are
expected to kick out a pound minimum per
[SPEAKER_00]: person per shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people turn in two pounds every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they spend time trimming that
little gravel shit, they would never get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a way of separating all those
little tiny buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that little stuff gets filtered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets pushed to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of that, those little buds
and the trim, they're combined and it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: turned in two concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do a nice tight trim if you want to
sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't go overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't trim it too tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also don't try trimming all those
little buds or you're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself in debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay your trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spending your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something I want to mention,
trimming will be very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buds are tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buds are real fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buds are little compacted little
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just kind of rub your fingers over
those and those are going to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buds are airy and have a lot of
texture to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be a little harder to
trim because you don't want to knock off
[SPEAKER_00]: all those calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're working for somebody else,
you're going to have to adjust to how they
[SPEAKER_00]: want it trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to a grow and you're working
for someone else, they get to dictate how
[SPEAKER_00]: tight your trim is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't over trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't under trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trim to their expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not sure what they want,
have them trim up a bud and show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have them trim up two or three buds and
set those at your workstation so you have
[SPEAKER_00]: something to refer to as the day goes on
so that you don't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if they come by and say,
hey, why are you doing it like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple little buds to show
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say, hey, these are what you
showed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me where I'm going wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they can say, fuck, you're doing it
just like I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a nice tight trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're setting the trim in one pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're setting our little tiny buds in
another pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mixing that up so we can make good
concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting rid of all the sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I think we have covered most of
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One great thing about trimming is
scissoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scissor and glove hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that sticky shit that builds up on
your gloves and scissors is smokable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike loves scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do if I've got,
if I've been trimming, so say you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming, you've got this weird layer of
like sticky, gooey looking shit all over
[SPEAKER_00]: your gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rub your hands together and you'll start
figuring out how to rub your hands in a
[SPEAKER_00]: circle to make that stuff stick together.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of heat goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your hands get warm, it'll start
taking that resin right off of your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke it off your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we used to call it finger
hash, but please wear gloves now and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to call it glove hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can scrape it off your scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke it off your gloves,
then put it in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it on top of some pot or just
put it in an empty bowl and just put a
[SPEAKER_00]: flame to it and melt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just slowly melt that shit until it starts
smoking and you can smoke that scissor
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, that glove hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please don't pass that shit to me if
you did that off your skin and weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one good thing about trimming is
you get scissor hash right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that anything that sticks to your
gloves, that's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come trim for me and that shit
sticks to your gloves, I have no problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with you rolling that right off your
glove, put that in a pipe and smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You earned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're trimming your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's on your scissors, scrape your
scissors off, smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a lot of people will do, all the
trimmers in the room will just gather all
[SPEAKER_00]: their scissor hash into one pile and put
it into a big ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the day,
you guys all smoke that together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little celebration,
but it's smokable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make edibles out of it if you want
to, but I would recommend smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike loves smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my favorite to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little, it's heavy on the lungs and
it tastes kind of wet, but it is potent
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will give you a big fat hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about dry trimming
that I didn't mention is that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were done trimming, you can now weigh your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been cutting off the extra crap and
throwing that in one pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've been throwing those finished
buds into one pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is set that container on
the scale and weigh it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would recommend, it's a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever container you're going to throw
your buds into, your finished buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's going to be a bucket, if it's
going to be a Tupperware container,
[SPEAKER_00]: weigh that and write the weight of that on
your container so that when you're done
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming into that container, you know how
much that weighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just subtract the weight of your
container and now you know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: product is on the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always rewarding knowing how much
product you've got right at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trim process.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you wet trim, you don't know because
you've got to wait for it to dry still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people say, how much did you trim
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, I trimmed a wet pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're paying people to trim by the
pound, dry trim is the way to go because
[SPEAKER_00]: now you've got dry pounds to weigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a wet pound to guess on the
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one more thing I should
definitely mention to all of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: who have never trimmed before,
everybody who is new with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something that I have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are trimming or working with
plants in general, do not touch your eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: with sticky trim fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rub your eye with the back of your
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go wash your hands before you touch your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you rub your eyes with trichomes or
plant resin on your finger, it is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn for the next hour and it is sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time you blink, most of the time
you think you can blink and it'll fix your
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky eye or whatever's in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not when you have resin in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you blink, it gets fucking
stickier and it feels like your eyelid is
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking to your eyeball and it just
burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need to itch your eye,
take your fucking glove off your hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: then itch your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost consider washing my hands
before the itch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the glove off, go wash the hand,
then scratch the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand sometimes you just got to
stick your finger in your eye because
[SPEAKER_00]: shit's going weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that glove off, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put plant resin or trichomes in your
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will fucking suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the technical term for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking sucks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I've given you a pretty
good lesson on trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I didn't teach you exactly how to
trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: The act of holding the bud and putting the
scissors to it is something you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will develop your technique and your
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've given you a pretty good
outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to do with the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to get it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need some practice doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some buds and put some scissors to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way you're going to get
good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only way you're going to get
faster at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we hire new trimmers at The Grow,
we don't always hire the people that claim
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the fastest trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hire the people that interview well and
seem like they're going to fit in with the
[SPEAKER_00]: crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say they can only trim a half a
pound of weed when they start,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is fine if that is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say they can trim a half a pound
and they only do a quarter pound,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I've got issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they say, I can trim a half a pound in
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will train them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will teach them our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll teach them some tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, they'll be trimming a
pound and a half a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about just finding the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about finding the groove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes you a little bit of time and
experience to get in there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these are buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are precious to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in this industry for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grab a flowering plant that's a few
days in and just cut that fucker down and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel no remorse or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what needed to happen in a
commercial grow, I kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people treat little buds like
they're the most precious thing they've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen, which I respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to grow a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have produced over a ton of cannabis in
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am responsible for a ton of cannabis
having been produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't have that under
their belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every bud is precious to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to fuck up one single bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're new at it, they go really
slow, especially a hired trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your bud that they're playing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect them for taking their time and
going slow with it, but also encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: them to go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn and go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people like to go slow in the
beginning because they're playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing with little pieces of
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got little babies in their hand and
they're new, so they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: intimidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get faster as time goes on is what
I'm trying to say, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need some practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll become a good trimmer if you want
to become a good trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to get your foot in the
door in the commercial marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: being a trimmer is probably the number one
way to get in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimmers and bud tenders are how you get
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trimming can be really time consuming
and tedious, but it is the last step
[SPEAKER_00]: before you claim victory in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your garden is for sale, you're one
step away from money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your garden is for medicinal uses,
you're one step away from feeling better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trimming sucks, but you're almost
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the hardest, most time consuming,
tedious part in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my least favorite part, but it is
one step away from sweet success.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast ruled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this trimming lesson made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the only way to get good at
trimming is to get sticky and get some
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there, get your gloves dirty,
get your scissors all sticky, and start
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming up some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn and you've got
friends that are harvesting, volunteer to
[SPEAKER_00]: trim for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody could use a free trimmer and we
know we're going to have to teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine, but we hope that in a few
harvests, you're going to show up and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to trim your ass off like a
savage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people that will help you
learn by letting you trim for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get those opportunities,
please do take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure I left
something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I missed something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I sparked any questions with this
episode, I invite you to email me all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is

[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear what I skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear what I left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got some other random
questions, I will answer those also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for listening
to the trimming episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the part where I pitch my Patreon
campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would truly appreciate your support on
Patreon.
