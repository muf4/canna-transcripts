[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we already read that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will start with this one from
Alaskan Pure Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me turn on the music just a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This iTunes review comes from our friend
Alaskan Pure Organics and it says,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was left on September 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I listen to every show,
informative and great guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's become my favorite show about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some other great podcasts out
there about cannabis so I appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing that I'm your favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks for the email and huge thanks
for the five star rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, our next review comes from a
listener who calls themselves Akatsuki
[SPEAKER_01]: Leader and they left the review on October
1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me of course a five star review
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff, keep up the fantastic work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just listened to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I started listening to your podcast
sometime about four to five months ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: the information and humor and love that
you put into this podcast is unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to many more episodes,
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm gonna put out a whole bunch more
episodes so stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been around for four or five
months, probably close to six months now,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since it's been a month since you left
this review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else that would like to leave a
review, please do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, just go to iTunes,
go to the iTunes store, search for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart podcast, find the
review section, type in a little comment
[SPEAKER_01]: and let me know what you think about the
show and I will read your review on a
[SPEAKER_01]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, big shout out to Akatsuki
Leader and Alaskan Pure Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate the reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the next thing on my agenda,
ladies and gentlemen, I wanna read some
[SPEAKER_01]: emails from a few listeners and I'm
searching for that email now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this listener, I don't know if
this person wants me to say their name so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip that, but it says,
Rasta Jeff, your podcast is so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were really entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly so much fun to listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly so much fun to listen to you host.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your growing lessons are on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearing you listen to JRE, I knew right
away this podcast was gonna be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna fucks with iRE genetics forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing legal cannabis for myself in
SoCal and I want to know how I can listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to your first 50 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I really wanted to give
thanks for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they signed their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you for the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am a huge, they said JRE.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Joe Rogan Experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge Joe Rogan Experience fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never skip an episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to almost every episode as soon
as it comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably my favorite podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Followed by The Church of What's Happening
Now with Uncle Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest with you, Doug Loves Movies
with Doug Benson is probably my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my top three.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also say my grow lessons are on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend a lot of time trying to create
grow lessons that are useful for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like it when the listeners
send me emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like creating content that is generated
from questions from listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you appreciate the grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you find them to be on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to fuck with IRE genetics
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you've got some IRE genetics in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, we need to figure out how to make
that happen for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing legally in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely need to get some IRE
genetics in your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you're growing out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to know what part of SoCal
you're in because that's where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually grew up in Bellflower,
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Bellflower High School for
middle school and then I moved to Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of ninth grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm from SoCal also.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people call me out and they're
like, what part of California are you
[SPEAKER_01]: from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what are you even talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that the clothes I wear and the
way that I am, they can tell I'm from
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been called out a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you also say you want to listen to
the first 50 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the feeds apparently don't have
the first 50 episodes because I'm all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way up to 160.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be 164.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like the last 64 episodes are
getting bumped out of the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been talking about doing is
going and finding those old episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on my drive over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to plug that in and find the
old episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably on my web server still
and just repost them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't know if I want to go back
and edit them at all and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a repost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I just want to repost it and put it
in the feed as a bonus episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's probably the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want them super bad,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are dying to hear the first 64
episodes or something, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can work out a way where I can
send you the files through WeTransfer or
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropbox or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I may just throw in the first episode
the first 50 episodes back in the feed,
[SPEAKER_01]: like every five or six episodes or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put another one in there so that you
guys can go listen to the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll also be a fun exercise in
seeing how much we've progressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you'll be able to spot the old
episodes right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may have to put the old episodes back
in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe if you send me an email and you
ask really nicely for a few episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't send you all 50 at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to blow up my computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you ask me for a few episodes at a
time, maybe I can send you a few at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can make a list or something,
a few people, and then I can just dump all
[SPEAKER_01]: the episodes to a few people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like five at a time or something,
five a week, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to help you out though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it going for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email me back if you want them as a file.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's listening, if you want the
first 50, we can figure something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see how many people are interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get on to the next email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from a very frequent listener,
somebody that I interact with on Twitter,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that's been a long time listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate you for hanging out so
long with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, I could probably say your name
because you use your Instagram and Twitter
[SPEAKER_01]: handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our friend FastBerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: FastBerry says, hello, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy hearing your curing episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your drying and curing method is almost
exactly the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know that people out there
are doing the things that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know that other people have
the same ideas that I do and are working
[SPEAKER_01]: with the same methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little affirmation is always a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also say, I would add that I trim dry
my plants on a piece of parchment paper so
[SPEAKER_01]: I can collect the resin heads off that
fall later when I clean up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, when you're about to trim your
buds, put down, what did he say that he
[SPEAKER_01]: added some parchment paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Put down a sheet of parchment paper over
the table and then trim onto the parchment
[SPEAKER_01]: paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're done, you can clean
up all the keef that came off of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a bunch of resin
heads on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can either put those in a
bowl and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're really into it, you can press
them if you know how to make rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that's useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the heads up on that one,
FastBerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also continues he says, I have a
full-time job, so no time for excessive
[SPEAKER_01]: burping of jars, but I do put the lids on
upside down, metal to glass, and loosely
[SPEAKER_01]: screw on the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, instead of sealing the cap
the normal way where it's got the waxy
[SPEAKER_01]: seal against the glass and then you put
the lid on real tight, he flips it upside
[SPEAKER_01]: down and puts the metal to glass on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not making a super tight seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he only screws it on medium
tight, apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loosely screws on the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, it allows some air exchange,
but it prevents buds from drying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that for 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I start the 12-hour check burp and
will repeat as needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then daily, then weekly, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, you know, you just did the
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: FastBerry on Instagram and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you go follow my friend
FastBerry on Instagram and or Twitter,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you let him know that you heard
his email on the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out FastBerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know that other people are
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys, that's a great update and a
great addition to what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a full-time job, if you can't
dedicate 24 hours a day to your grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is understandable, I'm not calling
you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people have a normal job and they
grow in their spare time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is you and you can't check those
jars, if you've got to go to work,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, for a long time, for like a year,
I lived 55 miles away from where I work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would take me one hour to get to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would be at work for eight to 12
hours, maybe 14 hours on some days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's another drive home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to do whatever you do
when you get home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to eat, you got to poop,
you got to shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put on clothes for the next
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get all that shit going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course it limited me to maybe four
or five hours of time that I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: work on my garden at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I totally understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are in that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can put your buds in these jars
and you can leave the lids on upside down
[SPEAKER_01]: and loose and you'll get some airflow in
there and you'll still slowly dry the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's your main objective is to
slowly and evenly dry these buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, FastBerry, I appreciate the
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys keep the emails coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is super helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got one more email that is actually
a correction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said something in an episode about THCA
converting to THC, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that shit backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me read an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says his name in the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, Hey brother, my name is Beep and
I've been listening to your podcast since
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard an episode on Tok Radio earlier on
in the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friends at Tok Radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Citizen Jay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you can listen to our podcast
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Wednesday at noon on TokRadio
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will correct that by the end of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will make sure I've got the right time
and date.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of shit in my head right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he listens to me on Tok Radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I'm a huge fan of the podcast,
your grow techniques, your advice,
[SPEAKER_01]: and your Airy Rasta way of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an aspiring cannabis enthusiast
myself, and I'm working on getting my foot
[SPEAKER_01]: in the door of the cannabis industry here
in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the past few years, I've been learning
as much about cannabis as I can before I
[SPEAKER_01]: enter either the medical or recreational
side of the industry when we establish a
[SPEAKER_01]: rec side that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to thank you, your friends,
and your podcast for supplying me with a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive amount of cannabis information and
grow tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that our podcast has put you on the
right path to where when you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into a facility, you could be a
leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could be one of the bosses,
the cultivation directors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe since it's new, maybe you can just
invent the phrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I'm cultivation director.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them so and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can get you your foot in the
door when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Connecticut, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever been to
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to a lot of places, and I cannot
remember ever going to Connecticut for any
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish would be the only thing that would
take me that direction, and I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen fish in Connecticut, so I remember
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, I'm going to continue with the
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, on a separate note, in the
episode you put out this morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: you asked to correct you if you got the
THC, THCA conversion wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I remember, the THC is what the
trichomes started off as, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: transform into THC when heating through
decarboxylization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through curing, most likely increases the
psychoactive potency of the trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: since THC decarboxylates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I got to spin the page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since THC carboxylates, where am I now?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the form of water vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if that was the solid
knowledge, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the rest of your day is iry,
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you were totally correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you said is, completely correct,
so thanks for the correction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, don't be afraid to correct me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I say something stupid on the podcast,
if I say something wrong, please send me
[SPEAKER_01]: an email and let me know that I done
fucked up because it's the only way that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can correct it, and I don't want to teach
people the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big part of why I started this
podcast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be on the forums, I'd be on the
internet, I'd be in Facebook groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I would see people give the
shittiest advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would be like, I'm in week five in
flower and I've got spider mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody would be like, go in there
and spray fluoromite, and I would just
cringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just now slapped myself in the face when
I read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh shit, I just did the
Macaulay Culkin, like no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of what inspired me to do
this podcast, was trying not to pass along
[SPEAKER_01]: fake information and try to give useful
information from experience because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a crazy grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have an idea and I think that
something might improve my crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only way to find out if it's going to
improve it is to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figure I've been growing long enough
to where I've got a good foundation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can skateboard, I cannot skateboard,
this is an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can skateboard real well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to hit the half pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I'll go in the grow room and
do half pipe tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, what if I just totally do
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And occasionally I fuck up and kill
plants, you guys, but that's all part of
[SPEAKER_01]: learning and experimenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm way sidetracked,
I'm way off my topic, but if I do
[SPEAKER_01]: something wrong, if I say something wrong,
please do correct me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse corrected me a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Jesse's dad told Jesse to come
and correct me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Jay and Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to anybody else who's ever sent
me a correction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like being corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me a better podcaster,
it makes me a better grower, and it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: me a better teacher, and it humbles me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So help me out and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I want to appreciate,
I want to appreciate, I already do
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody who sent me an
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody who sent me an
iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a shit ton more emails,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not ignoring the emails, the Facebook
messages, the Instagram messages that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many of them, but I picked a
few for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a few more in the next couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I feel like I'm talking really
fast, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably use a drink of water,
and of course I need a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to medicate myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hydrate myself, and I'll be
back in just a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a couple of fat dabs of some
Jack Flash shatter from our friends at TR
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super shattery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the, I said this before
on a previous episode, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: the consistency of a Jolly Rancher.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you tried to break Jolly Ranchers with
your fingers, it would just go popping and
[SPEAKER_01]: flying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of that hard consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hard texture, but it tastes really
good, and obviously it gets me really
[SPEAKER_01]: rambly high because I have been freaking
talking a million miles an hour in this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
my rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I promised you guys some grow tips and
grow tricks, but before I get that far,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about my most recent
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you listen to the podcast,
you know I made some Arise F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also crossed Arise F1 to Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those seeds have been harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've all been dried out properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend Jesse was given a few of those
the last time he was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barefoot Grower was given a few of those
when he was here for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of those have gone out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working some of the new seeds into my
grow schedule so that I can grow some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to know what the Arise F2
does, but I really want to know what that
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise to Lemon Skunk is going to do for me
because everything I've crossed to my
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Skunk female, everything has been
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also did Arise to Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super curious about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one will probably not be released for
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play with that one for a little
bit by myself, and then I'll put it out in
[SPEAKER_01]: seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to make more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have a small handful of seeds of
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The others, I have a lot of seeds,
so they'll go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my new breeding project, ladies and
gentlemen, let me talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am using the same Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a stud.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow me on Instagram,
you have seen this dude on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows for a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows some of the biggest colas,
the biggest male flowers I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: He puts resin out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He smells terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got this really funky stank to him,
which is a good thing for a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise is Golden Goat was the female,
and Daybreaker from Gage Green Genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: was the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the ones that the Joseph O
.G., Chem D crossed to Golden Goat,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is Island Sweet Skunk, Hawaiian
Sativa, and Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's such a good combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise is a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the male, and now the males are in
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast won't go out for quite some
time, but the males are now in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went into flower yesterday,
and I've got two huts with other plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: them, two five-by-five huts with
two-gallon pots, and the huts are crammed
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two-gallon pots stuffed in those
huts, and there are cookies and cream
[SPEAKER_01]: females, cookies and cream females,
white widow females.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lemon skunk females.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lemon Jeffrey in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple others in there that I
don't even need to mention yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we'll talk about those later in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are probably going to go into flower
maybe Monday, but anyway, pretty soon,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are gonna go into flower here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the male to get ahead just a little
tiny bit, but I don't want my girls to get
[SPEAKER_01]: too big, and they're starting to kind of
get tall, so I need to time this out just
[SPEAKER_01]: right, but I'm gonna keep the male
separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna let him flower out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same strain, but I just need
enough pollen to do two huts, so I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: two male plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna keep them separate to keep that
pollen in there, and then around day
[SPEAKER_01]: 25-ish, depending on how the plants look,
I'm gonna go and pollinate 25 of flower
[SPEAKER_01]: for the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go in and pollinate both of the
five-by-five huts worth of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we'll make a bunch of new
crosses, so that's what's going on in my
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep you guys updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you guys really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you guys probably don't care at
all, so let's move on to some grow tips
[SPEAKER_01]: like I talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I've been talking about growing
in cocoa coir a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've experimented with several brands of
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've experimented with different nutrient
feeds in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the cocoa, but one thing that sucks
is if you don't mix something in with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of compresses a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of gets to be too much around your
roots, and I feel like the plants that I
[SPEAKER_01]: did in all cocoa could have harvested
better had I mixed something into that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the cocoa that I used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the plants probably could have
been a little bit better, so if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna grow in cocoa, mix in maybe 50% soil
or maybe mix in a whole bunch of perlite,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've used a couple brands of
cocoa, and some of them compress a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them don't, and it's hard to tell
when they're in the bag, and I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: call out brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just learned that I want to mix my
cocoa with some soil and or some perlite,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's something I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: My babies, my clones, hated going into
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just died.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, no, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too much pressure on the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no air in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to die, and so I mixed some
50-50 with soil and threw it in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they grew but they weren't happy,
and then I put some just into straight
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, a soilless mix that I make for
babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no cocoa in it, and those plants
took off, so start your babies in some
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, maybe, unless you get them really
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're coming from Rockwool,
then it might work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming out of the easy cloner,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what happened from the easy
cloner, so I think soil or a 50-50 mix is
[SPEAKER_01]: better than just straight-up cocoa,
so that's something I wanted to mention to
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys through experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, one of our friends at Listen to
the Podcast was posting on Facebook that
[SPEAKER_01]: he's got a strain that takes a really long
time to flower, and it's way late into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower already, and it does not show any
signs of slowing down and being done,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was just asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to know WTF.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, what the fuck is going on with
this plant, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: My guidance, my advice was to reduce the
lights on that plant to speed up the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant is waiting for a signal to say,
hey, are you done yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just waiting for something to hint at it
that the season is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever that plant, it's hard to even
guess where that plant came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what strain you're working
with, but that plant comes from an area
[SPEAKER_01]: where the day and night cycle between the
winter and summer seasons does not vary
[SPEAKER_01]: very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it takes to make those plants flower,
they're very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll flower very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes those plants, those type of
plants, if they get root-bound,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they get crowded and they're not
getting enough light, they'll flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cool because they'll start
flowering very easily when you're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put them in the flower room,
you'll notice sometimes those will show
[SPEAKER_01]: flower earliest, but also they don't want
to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the season doesn't change,
let me get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mind is racing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the season doesn't change very much,
those plants can pretty much just go on
[SPEAKER_01]: until they wither up and die is what would
happen in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to keep going until they
receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like, hey, pollinate me,
pollinate me, please, please, please,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're just going to grow until they
fry themselves out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to reduce the lights to give
them a hint that, oh shit, grow season's
[SPEAKER_01]: over, I better finish up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on 12-12, turn the lights down
to maybe just give them 10 hours a day
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go 10-14 and just do that for two weeks
and I'm sure they'll start finishing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be finished up in two weeks from
doing that, so maybe start flushing,
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that will certainly help
you with a strain that is taking way too
[SPEAKER_01]: long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a Durban poison strain that took 16
weeks to flower properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started chopping down the lights a
little bit, it certainly sped up the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cut off two full weeks if I did it,
two weeks if I timed it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That grow was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even fuck with that Durban poison
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need for that shit in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have a good Durban poison cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense to yours, but the one I had,
no, I did not want to work with that
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing, everybody got, not
everybody, a lot of people got powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew last winter and the winter is
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to get powdery mildew
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about some ways that you can
prevent powdery mildew that possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: happens because it's winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it gets cold outside and it stays
warm inside, so you're growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you are in a basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you are in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably got one concrete wall
somewhere that your plants are really
[SPEAKER_01]: close to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outside of that wall is going to get
temperatures that are really ridiculously
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the opposite side of that wall,
you've got a beautiful grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that moisture builds up on the
outside and makes that wall a weird cold
[SPEAKER_01]: wall and then the heat hits it,
a lot of grow rooms, I see it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happened to me the first time I moved
into this one house that I grew in this
[SPEAKER_01]: one basement that had a concrete wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant, we've talked about it before,
that plant in that corner where the
[SPEAKER_01]: concrete corner was, it got completely
powdery mildew all up that one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at another facility that had a
garage door type of thing and right there
[SPEAKER_01]: in that area, those plants started getting
powdery mildew on the first snowfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something you can do, something you're
going to need to think about is how to
[SPEAKER_01]: heat those areas properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe build a separate wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this sounds extreme, but if you've
got a wall, if your grow facility has a
[SPEAKER_01]: wall that is on the exterior of the
building and it is concrete or it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: well insulated, you may want to build a
six inch gap in there and put some
[SPEAKER_01]: insulation in there so that when it snows,
you've got a buffer zone so that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not freezing your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else you can do to help prevent
powdery mildew, and this is just for all
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons, when the plants start going into
flower and getting a little bit of chunky
[SPEAKER_01]: buds, I like to go in and take off most of
the big fan leaves, most of those water
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves, the sun leaves, whatever you want
to call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to pull the majority of those off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think that I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think I'm nuts for doing it,
but go in there about week three of flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and take off all those pedials and watch
them grow back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll freak out because they come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants will be way more productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see production and what you're
doing is you're letting the light
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get light down to the bottom buds
to where you don't have to lollipop as
[SPEAKER_01]: high and you're also creating more air
space and at the same time, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: removing places for powdery mildew to land
and build up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times what happens, you guys,
in a warm, humid grow room, you've got one
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf and another leaf resting right on top
of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine you're on the bus and the dude
next to you just rests his fucking hand
[SPEAKER_01]: right on yours on the bus in the middle of
the summer and his hand is sweating and
[SPEAKER_01]: your hand is sweating and you got to ride
all day, 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got fans going on in there,
but there's this area sometimes where the
[SPEAKER_01]: fans don't hit every single leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to ride in there for 12 hours with
the lights on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine how sticky and funky your hand is
going to be after 12 hours of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top leaf is sweating on the bottom
because all that leaf pressed against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom leaf is sweating from the top
because all that leaf against it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just creating funk inside of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildew will pop up from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pull off all these extra leaves,
you eliminate the opportunity for that
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew to develop under your
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that's really helpful,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's less places for bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go in there and you pull off all
the leaves, it's way less opportunity for
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs to hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs prefer those leaves with longer
pedials that stick out a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: further.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to go right underneath those
real big ass leaves and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first place you're going to see
bug damages on the low, larger leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eliminate that shit, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even give the bugs an opportunity to
get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, clean up the bottoms of your plants,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing should touch the pot or the floor
or the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the stuff that's hanging off the
bottom of your plant should really touch
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get in there with some scissors
at the early start of flower, just clean
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the size of pot and size of
plant you're using, I usually have at
[SPEAKER_01]: least six to eight inches between the pot
and the first two stalks that come off my
[SPEAKER_01]: branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will clean that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if I'm going in a larger pot and
growing larger plants, I'll clean a foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes a green and healthy,
when I had the large warehouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would over veg for too long and then we
would just trellis everything out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that didn't reach, I would just chop
off all the branches that didn't reach to
[SPEAKER_01]: the trellis and we'd have a foot and a
half of just naked shaved legs,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes two feet of just naked bare
shaved legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that promotes better airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it gives you less opportunity
for bugs to get in there, less places for
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not trying to grow leaves,
we're trying to go grow buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get in there about week three,
excuse me, get in there about week three,
[SPEAKER_01]: take off most of your fan leaves,
if not all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to leave the two on the top of the
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got that top cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to leave two or four leaves up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grab some light, create some
energy, but that lower stuff, just go mad,
[SPEAKER_01]: I take most of that lower shit right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I get in there about week five and do
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll feed it a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will feed it a root pack and a foliar
pack to make it explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse the throat clearing you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to TR concentrates with their
tag flash hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge fat dabs made me a little choked up,
but I like to get in there and take off
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves, feed it a root pack,
feed it a foliar pack, feed it a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom booster about week five,
week six, and then go in there and pull
[SPEAKER_01]: off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll really notice it in the whole cup,
that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica strains really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow, blueberry, that type of stuff really
appreciates it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the sativa dominant strains don't
go super heavy, but still get in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: take off some leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's what I think about
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Jesse and I did an episode,
we talked about cleaning up your outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean up your indoor garden, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a broom and sweep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just why not sweep up at the end of the
day?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend an extra five or 10 minutes and
sweep up that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick up all the little litter that lands
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's a zip tie that you use for
something that you cut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to leave extra stuff
sitting around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put all your tools away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put all your equipment away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean out your sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean out your pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean out anything that can be cleaned so
that it's ready for you the next time you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take a couple minutes at the end of
the day and clean shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing at home, you guys,
have dedicated stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a dedicated broom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a dedicated dust pan for your grow
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to have a dedicated trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you clean up, when you sweep up,
if you've got dead leaves on the floor,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you find that you've got some dead bugs
on the floor, sometimes you'll find
[SPEAKER_01]: randomly just there'll be a little pile of
dead like white flies or fungus gnats or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you sprayed and then a few days
later, all these bugs died and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: all landed over there by that fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you clean that stuff up, sweep it all
up into a trash can and take that trash
[SPEAKER_01]: can out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't leave it in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got dead leaves in there,
don't leave those in the grow either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every dead leaf and piece of stuff on the
floor is another place for a bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said this to somebody the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, if you got five spider mites
hiding underneath one leaf, two of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to hook up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of them are going to fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to make a million spider
mite babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the math on that because it's just
going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got five people at a party,
by the end of the night, two people are
[SPEAKER_01]: hooking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how these spider mites are going to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you leave one leaf and you got five
spider mites under there, in five days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have that multiplied by
whatever spider mites breed out,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a ridiculous rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean up that one leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need for all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out the shop vac and clean up the
corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dust the tops of the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be amazed at how many bugs are in
the crevices in your Gavita lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a large commercial facility
and you get up top and you clean out your
[SPEAKER_01]: lights, there's a bunch of bugs up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean all that shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to have that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also clean your fans while you're at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been rambling on for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's enough info,
enough tips, and a bunch of email talking
[SPEAKER_01]: for one episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
an episode of just me rambling by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still working on the episode I
promised you about pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pets prevention, management,
identification, and eradication.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing how to take care of a whole
bunch of bugs, a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a multi-show piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to write out at least two full
episodes before I get it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of episodes I've got written out
and I'm getting ahead of myself with,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a debate about organics versus,
I don't know if it's a debate,
[SPEAKER_01]: but whatever, the pros and cons of
organics versus synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a lot of other great stuff
coming up for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys stay tuned to future
