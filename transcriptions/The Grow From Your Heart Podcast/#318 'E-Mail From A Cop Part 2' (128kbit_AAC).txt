[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 318 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No music today, just a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by my
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this podcast is brought to you by my
friends at PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you the type of grower that wants to
know what's going on in your garden while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're away?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay attention to what's happening
at all times with your PL Grow Systems
[SPEAKER_00]: Minder Unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more about the Minder Unit,
check out PL Grow Systems at plgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: .systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, podcast world, I like to start
the episodes off by letting you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of New York
City Diesel Ambrosia Batter from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cracked open the jar and I'm
holding it kind of low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not up by my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can just smell the diesel funk turps
coming out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take a dab of this, it leaves
this decently layer of funky cotton mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: over your tongue that is just disgustingly
delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so thick and so funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my mouth super dry, but I love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes on super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes right to the face, right to the
head and something that I've noticed from
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually my eyes don't get very red when I
smoke, but today my eyes are bloody dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: red from the New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary and Colorado Springs for the
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City Diesel Ambrosia Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my eyes are so red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever been able to feel how red
your eyes are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they're bubbly and just bloody
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, what do we want to
talk about next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got all of the videos up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All 317 episodes are now up on YouTube,
which means I'm one behind because this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode is out, but I'm going to try to
get everything out within a week of
[SPEAKER_00]: posting a new episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the episodes come out,
on iTunes and Stitcher, within a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to have it up on YouTube,
which shouldn't be a challenge at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying a week to buy myself time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me a little bit of time to make
the video and then loading the video takes
[SPEAKER_00]: several hours and then YouTube has to
process the video and then it finally pops
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to stay less than a
week behind on all of the YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the people watching on YouTube
are almost current.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're less than a week behind at all
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the videos are on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to watch on YouTube,
just simply search for the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart Podcast and you will find the
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode of the podcast,
I read an email from a cop and while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: reading his email, I actually asked him a
few questions and he was kind enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: reply already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a response from our friend,
the cop, and if you didn't listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you go back and listen to
episode 317 where I read the email from a
[SPEAKER_00]: cop and this is email from a cop part two
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, I hope this message finds
you well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to the podcast and I was really
stoked to hear my letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to address a few points we
brought up during the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave a small rant on how cops giving
tickets and arresting people has a
[SPEAKER_00]: snowball like effect on people and becomes
more punitive than a simple ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally can't stand highway patrol or
traffic enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into this to help people who can't
help themselves and to go after the
[SPEAKER_00]: predators in society.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people deserve warnings,
a chance to be educated, about traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: violations and to be wished well on their
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save the ink for the real bad dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I like that approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to pull people over and
say, hey bro, we need you to slow down in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area because we got trucks coming on
the highway or whatever, but just pull
[SPEAKER_00]: them over, explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull them over, give them $150
ticket and fuck up their whole month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they hate the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like your approach, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull them over, explain why, don't give
them a ticket, tell them, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: be careful, have a great day, send them on
their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I think policing should be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's respectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the email goes on and it says,
I also wanted to address your question
[SPEAKER_00]: about if I will be able to be a cannabis
advocate with my law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: coworkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: By my actions and my attitude,
I can influence other officers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will not be able to be open about
the amazing effects cannabis has had for
[SPEAKER_00]: me while I am still employed by the
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go talking about something that
could get you fired and will cause turmoil
[SPEAKER_00]: within your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your coworkers are seeing it
and they're like, man, he's actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well just using cannabis and you're
not too braggadocious about it and too
[SPEAKER_00]: open about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet your close friends see it and I bet
they're telling their other friends and I
[SPEAKER_00]: bet words getting around and they know
without you blasting it too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: without airing it out there too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they're accepting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nobody's targeting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more paragraph of the email
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, is any strain with black
cherry in it meant it was originally from
[SPEAKER_00]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really enjoying some black cherry
cookies Indica right now and it's super
[SPEAKER_00]: yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he's referring to is my strain black
cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a cross called black cherry Kim
several years ago, which is discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer available, but no,
if it says black cherry Kim, that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the black cherry clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't even use black cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black cherry Kim was at plush berry cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plush berry was very black cherry
dominant and it made it brought out the
[SPEAKER_00]: black cherry in the black cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got the name black cherry Kim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make the black cherry soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from another breeder who I
believe may be from Oregon, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of an older strain and no,
I did not breed or create the black
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything with black cherry in it was
gonna be from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't give me credit for all that black
cherry stuff you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black cherry Kim is the only one I
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wraps up the email by saying,
have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always able and willing to answer
questions should they come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks again for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the great interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did respond with another
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, thanks again for the great emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: What state do you live in?
[SPEAKER_00]: If this guy is in Colorado and he's
willing to be on the podcast, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask him to be on the show and I will drive
to wherever he is and we will record a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice podcast section with a cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys have questions,
you want me to ask a cop, start sending
[SPEAKER_00]: them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start getting your questions
prepared to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask a cop on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Hey Mike, I might want you to come
with me for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to read a couple of more quick
[SPEAKER_00]: emails before we wrap up this Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stacks and stacks of emails that
I'd like to catch up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is quick and it says,
Hey Rasta Jeff, still loving the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of your time and effort
that you take out of your schedule to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce and deliver great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes on to make a couple of
offers to help me catch up on the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel and do a few technical things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey man, I've got that taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a new MacBook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some changes and I've got it all
solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you reaching out and
trying to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever got any questions,
please send me a question and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: answer it on the show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another quick email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Jeff, congratulations
on the 300th episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice milestone brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, keep the train rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he asks a question about a
previous conversation him and I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how that was resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me another email and we will get
back on that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their names set
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, get roasted and toasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 is this person's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, I just started listening to
your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for about a year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to know what you think about
back building or bud pinching technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, plus do you have
a strain that's 20 to one CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm needing a strain for my wife who has
lupus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannot have high levels of THC due to
being a patient of a pain clinic in my
[SPEAKER_00]: state that has not gotten there as far as
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get roasted and toasted 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start from the top here,
get roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back building and bud pinching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to Google that and figure out what
that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to ask this emailer what they meant
by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that back building is where you
cut off the top of a bud to induce bud
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like one 10th of the bud size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he told me to Google it and he
said he just saw it come up in forms and
[SPEAKER_00]: on Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did this a long time ago to a
plant on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was moving a plant that had just started
budding and the top of it got chopped off
[SPEAKER_00]: and it made a pretty good size top bud,
but it never tightened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom of the plant made nice buds,
but that top one just grew funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have any experience in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I would encourage cutting
off buds during flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be totally wrong, but in my
opinion, I feel like this would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: slow down your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may make them explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be very strain specific,
but it's not something that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend for a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be time consuming and
unless it's going to give me a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of more bud, I don't think it would be
worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I don't have any experience with
back building or bud pinching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about it to say that I
would recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it sounds like something that I
would probably skip personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe experiment with it in your personal
garden if you want to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pick one plant and back build it,
bud pinch it, and then don't do that to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other plants and see if that one
performs better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's strain specific, but from my
experience, when I accidentally did that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not like the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to grow things that you
just want to make concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that would work for you because in
my experience, it made a fluffier bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't tighten up like it should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the buds tightened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the plants of the same strain
got tighter, more dense is what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that top bud where I had kind of
pinched it on accident, that one didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: tighten up like the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my experience and I wouldn't do
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the next part of your email,
you asked if I have a strain that is 20 to
[SPEAKER_00]: one CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, unfortunately, I do not breed that
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I breed is the exact
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am breeding for high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a fan of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just not what I am breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually breed strains that work for my
brain injury, strains that work for my
[SPEAKER_00]: body type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains that work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm my guinea pig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm my tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm breeding high THC, high limonene,
high turpentine type strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the 20 to one CBD strain that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want you to find something that will
help out your wife with her lupus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend Tora Bora from DNA
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find Tora Bora, that's a high
CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been lab tested and it's a proven
cannabis cup winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for the Tora Bora from DNA
Genetics and hopefully you can find some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that's a high CBD strain and
it should certainly help hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviate some of the effects of the lupus
there with your wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man, stay strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very admirable of you trying to
find strains specifically to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: your wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough emails for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to catch up a couple of
those quick loose ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a ton more emails that I want to
work my way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start getting through the pile now
that I've got the YouTube channel caught
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little bit more time,
more areas to focus my energy.
