podcast ladies and gentlemen I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: if you could still hear it in my voice I
could still feel it in my body still kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of recovering from the the virus the
plague that I had for a little bit so if
[SPEAKER_00]: this show feels a little bit low energy a
little bit slow I do apologize I'm up here
[SPEAKER_00]: doing my best the virus kicked my ass dude
I feel like I've still got low energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: high temperature is how I felt I'm still
doing what I got to do trying to get my
[SPEAKER_00]: day going get the world going get the
podcast going the business going taking
[SPEAKER_00]: care of the garden back in action but I do
take a little bit more breaks and it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: me longer to do things anyway that is my
covid update also one thing I've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: my attention span is really ah it's it is
messed up something's fucked up the vid
[SPEAKER_00]: messed up my attention span so I apologize
if I feel a little bit out of focus I
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking am dude I am also something I'm
gonna notice and mention after covid dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: are wrecking me oh my goodness when I take
a little dab or a medium dab or a big dab
[SPEAKER_00]: it feels so so incredibly dabalicious I'm
getting lit from the dab right I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling now let's get into the main part
of this podcast here I did say that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: some patreon messages here in front of me
this one comes from our friend SC Dung
[SPEAKER_00]: Slinger and it goes a little bit like this
it says hey buddy could you send the
[SPEAKER_00]: patreons and advanced text when you add
drops to iri direct I listen to all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts and IG but I don't do discord
when I found out about iri direct and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff I would have enter ah let's see
it it's a year your autocorrect blasted
[SPEAKER_00]: you out here it was already gone by the
time you saw it was available I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what autocorrect turned your sense into it
doesn't make sense to me but we'll not
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with that here on the show it says I
know you have stuff I know you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a staff like the dude gross show but they
send the patreon to text every time they
[SPEAKER_00]: post anything to the DGC patreon so what
our friend here is talking about is I have
[SPEAKER_00]: added iri direct comm to my lineup iri
genetics comm in the middle of the web
[SPEAKER_00]: page there is a tab that says direct or
you can simply click or simply type in iri
[SPEAKER_00]: direct it will get you right there that is
where you can get iri genetics you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: the regular seeds the feminine seeds a lot
of new stuff a lot of older stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: available there so what my friend is
asking for is for when I post new items on
[SPEAKER_00]: iri direct is that I let the patreon
members know that there is new stuff up
[SPEAKER_00]: there so that they can get a jump on it
that is a great request that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: question yes I will do my best to start
doing that like you said I don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: staff it's just me doing 99% of this work
I get some help here and there with some
[SPEAKER_00]: things I feel comfortable with but
honestly I like to do most of it by myself
[SPEAKER_00]: it lets me know it's getting done
correctly if there's a mistake I blame it
[SPEAKER_00]: on me I fix it quickly things will happen
but I do most of it by myself also I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't advertise on the patreon and the
discord and as much as I could I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: advertise online as much as I could
because that's not really what I'm there
[SPEAKER_00]: for people know that I exist people know
the company is established the seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: available I'm on discord and patreon to
kind of hang out with the crew to hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: with the people part of the to be a part
of the community not there just to
[SPEAKER_00]: advertise I do throw my advertising out
what kind of business would I be if I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't that's a big part of social media a
big part of why I'm there but I try not to
[SPEAKER_00]: bombard you with like hey buy seeds hey
buy seeds you know they're there but I do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the request that I let you know
the seeds are there yes I will let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when I put new beans on the iri
direct com website also the patrons are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get exclusive and discounts I
know that for a long time you guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for deals on seeds through patreon
I can't do it directly through patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: because patreon doesn't agree with that
what I can do is I can give you coupon
[SPEAKER_00]: codes where you can go to my website or
the beans are available I can do the
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon codes I can help you out there so
in the future there will be exclude
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusives and there will also be discount
codes for the patron members also sign up
[SPEAKER_00]: for the mail chimp because if you go to my
website there's a part on the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the website that says sign up for the
newsletter if you sign up for that you
[SPEAKER_00]: will also get notifications about fresh
drops you don't have to join the patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: the newsletter on mail chimp will help you
out but patron patreon patrons are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get exclusives early drops discounts
things like that I do plan on putting more
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff up on iri direct there's plenty of
stuff up there right now there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: great deals up there I'm not going to talk
about too much in here on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some great stuff I will be adding
a lot of stuff right after the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: concerts in September the start of
September fish is playing four days at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick's soccer field in Denver and I am
going to all four nights then I will need
[SPEAKER_00]: a day or two to recover from that then we
will load up iri direct with brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff for the month of September the
patrons will get a coupon code there will
[SPEAKER_00]: be a mail chimp newsletter to let you know
that it happened discord will get notified
[SPEAKER_00]: but once again the patrons will get a fat
coupon code it'll be tier-based based on
[SPEAKER_00]: your level of contribution all right there
is more to this do I need to read this
[SPEAKER_00]: part on the show no this part is for me
that was personal thank you bro I did read
[SPEAKER_00]: this part where you gave me a huge
compliment I do appreciate that thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter how long I do this podcast no
matter how many people show me love give
[SPEAKER_00]: me respect send me letters the type of
thing that you said those compliments that
[SPEAKER_00]: encouragement that always matters that
does go a long way that feels the fire so
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you I do appreciate that all right
I'm gonna keep moving I've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: more messages here in front of me and I am
already running out of air I operated a
[SPEAKER_00]: high pace when I do this podcast I go kind
of quickly somebody told me that it felt
[SPEAKER_00]: urgent I just tried not to lose my train
of thought is really what's going on but I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't keep up my own pace I don't have
enough air the vid got me bro I apologize
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not making excuses I'm just letting
you know that's why I sound like I'm out
[SPEAKER_00]: of breath and I'm trying to get through
the show excuse me for the throat clearing
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna edit a lot of this this message
comes from they don't even say their name
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not gonna say her name because you
didn't put your name on here the message
[SPEAKER_00]: says hey Rasta Jeff what's up bro good to
meet you says I live right near the beach
[SPEAKER_00]: that sounds like a good time until we read
the message it says I see that my early
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering plants were pollinated that's a
bummer maybe they were pollinated I would
[SPEAKER_00]: go check it squeeze a little bit and see
if there are seeds in there those could
[SPEAKER_00]: just be swollen bracts a lot of people
assume sometimes that a swollen bract is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated plant go give it a squeeze I
could be just a swollen calyx a swollen
[SPEAKER_00]: bract up there go check it out I could be
completely wrong I haven't seen your girl
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any pictures I'm hoping for
the best it goes on it says do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a bad idea growing outside living
right near the beach or a tourist
[SPEAKER_00]: destination so you live near the beach or
a tourist destination and you're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody could pass a hemp farm on the way
to said beach and then you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna pass the hemp farm and then
they're gonna bring the pollen to your
[SPEAKER_00]: girl one accident as they travel that is
less likely than my suspicion my suspicion
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it is probably wind there's
probably somebody else growing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area you're not the only person who got
the idea to grow some ganja this year and
[SPEAKER_00]: there is probably somebody else growing
hemp or cannabis within a few miles of
[SPEAKER_00]: your cultivation site hemp hemp and
cannabis it's the same pollen pollen can
[SPEAKER_00]: travel for quite a distance in the wind
and it can pollinate your plants so it was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably wind somebody in your four or
five mile radius probably has a male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever the wind it travels wherever you
are you could be in another country you
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a different part of the world but
the wind is probably going this way
[SPEAKER_00]: there's probably somebody with a male that
way and you're down this way and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen is just going that way I don't
suspect it's people going to a hemp farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting pollen on them and then
passing through your neighborhood that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't seem it's possible could be more
likely it would be pollinators birds bees
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that and the wind is probably
the number one culprit there or it could
[SPEAKER_00]: just be weird genetics or something went
crazy and the grow also but my assumption
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've talked enough about that one
I think there's a male plant within the
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five mile radius of your plant and
it's simply skeet skeetily deeded on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant I don't think that it was tourists
let me answer the question because there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a specific part do I think that it's
risky let me dial that in and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: ramble past it do you think it's a bad
idea growing outside living near the beach
[SPEAKER_00]: no but you're gonna have to these are the
kind of things that we're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with as the nation the entire country
is starting to legalize cannabis there are
[SPEAKER_00]: way more states that have legal cannabis
than illegal cannabis this is a an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural issue that we're gonna have
to deal with when people are growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: their own personal grows and some a lot of
people out there don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify a male a lot of people don't even
think about identifying a male some people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do the way that I think it should be
done in test to plant indoors and then
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it outdoors they don't all have that
opportunity so there are gonna be males
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors wherever people are cultivating
males will happen and this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in a culta in a in an agriculture
and let me try that again I'm not even
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna edit that in an agricultural
environment like in farmland back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day before cannabis came about I feel like
they forgot about this when we started
[SPEAKER_00]: zoning for cannabis here in Colorado they
would make sure that certain crops or
[SPEAKER_00]: certain distances apart so that this guy
can't pollinate this guy's crop and this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy can't pollinate this guy's crop they'd
keep them so many miles apart I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like 2.4 miles or one point I
obviously don't remember the exact number
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a distance they would put
farms apart where they couldn't cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems for each other seems like we
totally forgot that when it came to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis a lot of new people out there a
lot of just home growers growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard this is something we are going to
have to deal with so be ready for that be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared also don't be that grower I've
done a full episode on making sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't put male plants outdoors all right
I've got another message here in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: me this one is kind of long let's go for
it this one says rasta Jeff what are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of your favorite integrated pest
management management this that's harder
[SPEAKER_00]: to say than it looks let me try to read it
again what are some of your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated pest management products and
rotations you did mention evergreen but
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't list any of your other
favorites all right that's a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: question what pesticide products do I like
to use I often work in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities I've also got a
personal grill I'd also do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting for friends and family most of
what I'm going to talk about are products
[SPEAKER_00]: that are approved and regulated by the
Colorado marijuana enforcement division
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the Colorado Department of
Agriculture and also the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Public Health and
Environment I do not know the rules the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations the laws the fine print where
you are I can only say speak on my area
[SPEAKER_00]: and honestly I didn't read these rules
change so rapidly and frequently here that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the products on my list could have
been banned since I blinked after I wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: this I could have came from the computer
sat here they could have sent out an email
[SPEAKER_00]: saying hey you can no longer use some of
the stuff on your list that's just how the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry goes right now it's how it's
going to be we are evolving we are
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting and adapting when they find out
there's a problem with the product I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to adjust find a new product to use
for that so what I'm going to tell you is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'd recommend for my personal
facilities my commercial facilities in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Colorado you're going to have to
make your own personal decisions when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to pesticides what level of toxicity
do you want in your facility a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to stay organic a lot of
people don't care if they're using nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: war in their grow it's all chemicals no
matter how organic you go no matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: abrasive of a product to use it is all
chemicals people like to stick with the
[SPEAKER_00]: buzzword organic but then I remind them
that cyanide is organic does that make it
[SPEAKER_00]: okay to you and then they get flustered
with me but keep in mind that you're the
[SPEAKER_00]: one making the ethical decisions in this
grow so if you want to use something that
[SPEAKER_00]: may stick around in that plant that could
cause harm to somebody don't share it
[SPEAKER_00]: don't sell it smoke it yourself but if
you're going to share stuff use things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more health conscious to your
consumers also the big hippie in me is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to remind you to be conscious of the
environment don't destroy the earth don't
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the planet that small patch of
land right there is yours right now but
[SPEAKER_00]: everything around it is other people's the
part above it below it other people and in
[SPEAKER_00]: a few years it will be somebody else's so
don't fuck that up now my other rant when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to pesticides I am trained by the
Colorado Department of Agriculture I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trained by a lovely lady named Theo Walker
took a nice long class passed a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great test and if I did not remind you
guys to always wear your personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment when mixing and using
a pesticide I would be doing my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Theo Walker a disservice and not honoring
my education so you guys out there I'm I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to say this as part of just who I am
my responsibility my my morals my ethics
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want you to be safe wear the
appropriate personal protective equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're applying a pesticide when
you're getting it off the shelf have your
[SPEAKER_00]: eye protection and gloves on when you
start mixing it up have your long sleeves
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on your pesticide container if you
grab the container there's a little book
[SPEAKER_00]: that folds out inside that book it will
tell you the recommended clothing or
[SPEAKER_00]: personal protective equipment the minimum
personal protective equipment required for
[SPEAKER_00]: that pesticide please wear that also
inside of that booklet you will find what
[SPEAKER_00]: is known as the reentry interval what that
means is from the time you spray it this
[SPEAKER_00]: is how long you have got to wait before
you can go back in that environment they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want you to get contaminated if
you're spraying you're creating air
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles there's a mist in the room you
don't want the misty part in your lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't want the wet fresh pesticide
off the plants on your skin and your eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: and your body now you're contaminated
let's not do that to ourselves honor that
[SPEAKER_00]: reentry interval something I'm going to
add if you are in an indoor environment
[SPEAKER_00]: which means your house inside your house
inside of a cultivation facility a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse may not be fall under this
category if you're an indoor enclosed
[SPEAKER_00]: environment or the Sun is not getting into
there I recommend that you increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: reentry interval by a minimum of two hours
I would recommend four hours my reason for
[SPEAKER_00]: this is I mentioned the Sun a moment ago
most of the time the Sun the wind the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment will break down a lot of the
pesticides which you have applied to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants nature can happen better outside we
are in an indoor environment there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: wind we do have fans but it's just moving
it around the room it's not traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere necessarily then we've got no Sun
in there to break down that pesticide the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights not going to do the same thing the
Sun is magic so give yourself two to four
[SPEAKER_00]: more hours of reentry interval time before
you enter that room after applying a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide application I recommend applying
a pesticide right as the lights go out or
[SPEAKER_00]: right after the lights go you can open it
up and spray spray them you they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna mess anything up if you're just in
there for one or two minutes hit them with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pesticide spray zip it back up close
it back up whatever do it right as the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights go out then you've got at least
eight twelve hours before you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: in there again so you've got plenty of
time to dry up then when you go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: again look at them they should look super
happy sometimes if I've applied an oily
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide or something that is really
abrasive I will go in and just hose the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants down with just fresh water I'll get
my pump sprayer or my paint sprayer
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I'm doing and just spray the
plants down with clean pH balanced water
[SPEAKER_00]: just to wash off that extra pesticide just
give it a little bit of a rinse I'll turn
[SPEAKER_00]: off the lights give it a spray let them
dry turn the lights back on business as
[SPEAKER_00]: usual keep rocking so we talked about
reentry interval we talked about pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about your ethics we talked
about not sharing contaminated products
[SPEAKER_00]: with others people smoke whatever you want
bro if you're gonna fucking smoke it by
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself if it's not going anywhere you
can spray whatever you I don't recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: it it's not what I would do but you can do
whatever you want if you've got to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bugs just don't share that shit we
make medical marijuana was our goal here
[SPEAKER_00]: not make other sick make other people sick
marijuana keep that in mind the people are
[SPEAKER_00]: already sick they already have a
compromised immune system possibly they
[SPEAKER_00]: could have cancer they could have other
conditions and you want to give them
[SPEAKER_00]: something to make them better not sick
that's your goal don't be that guy now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's actually talk about some of the
pesticides that I will recommend my
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy all depends on the space the
environment the room the type the time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year what am I going to be facing as a
problem as a bug what's my problem in this
[SPEAKER_00]: room what am I trying to get rid of we all
know that most of the time we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of spider mites thrips fungus
gnats white flies those are most and
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew also is a very common thing
that we're mostly trying to get rid of or
[SPEAKER_00]: keep away from our grow I work in a lot of
commercial environments a lot of big
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces in Colorado where they get a lot of
spider mites it's like they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: passing around the mites it's the trim
crews that are bringing them around I
[SPEAKER_00]: suspect I can't prove it but they're the
only new people coming and going it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: trim crew bringing the spider mites shout
out to the trim crew I still love you but
[SPEAKER_00]: um we get a lot of mites here and we get a
lot of powdery mildew so I know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: beat that very well a lot of people are
getting russet mites I can destroy that
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus gnats thrips white flies that's
amateur hour we can get rid of that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: so I really treat to prevent spider mites
powdery mildew things like that the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do it is I like to have a yellow
sticky trap every three to six feet ish in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden so if I got those six foot by
five foot trays I usually put two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky traps per tray down kind of low we
do a lot of lollipopping between the pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and the start of the plant is about 12 to
18 inches depending on the strain and how
[SPEAKER_00]: long we fucking vegged in that area I will
hang yellow sticky traps the bugs love to
[SPEAKER_00]: go in that area then I may put some up
higher also but I definitely get down
[SPEAKER_00]: there by the legs those are not in any way
designed to eradicate or remove or
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate a bug those are there to
indicate the presence of a pest those say
[SPEAKER_00]: hey dude there's these black sticky things
all over here count them see how many
[SPEAKER_00]: there were you saw them on the first break
before you went to break check on them
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go to lunch and check on them
at third break then if we need to up our
[SPEAKER_00]: game we know we've got bugs in there so
the yellow sticky traps are my first line
[SPEAKER_00]: of defense my second line of defense is
just myself and the grotex looking just
[SPEAKER_00]: use your eyes when you're in there
watering defoliating popping twisting
[SPEAKER_00]: taking out the trash whatever you're doing
just look at the plants occasionally do
[SPEAKER_00]: you see signs of spider mites do you see
thrift damage do you see anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates hey there are bugs so the first
way to get rid of and prevent them is just
[SPEAKER_00]: to scout for them and have some sort of
alarm system those yellow sticky traps let
[SPEAKER_00]: me know that they are there now let's talk
about what I like to apply what I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is I generally apply pesticides on a
Monday it's just something that's easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind every Monday we do apply a
pesticide if I know that the season is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming where the mites are gonna get
strong or the fungus gnats get real strong
[SPEAKER_00]: or if another facility has bugs or
something like that then I will increase
[SPEAKER_00]: to Monday and Thursday depending on which
bugs I'm facing if I'm doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative or if I'm doing an
eradication spray or if I'm doing a holy
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck spray that tells me which products
I'm going to use I do rotate I do like to
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate the products I will use two or
three products together at one time also
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mix them in this pump sprayer and
I'll spray two or three products at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you rotate that's a very
important thing is to rotate if you hit
[SPEAKER_00]: them with one product today and the same
product tomorrow by day three they're
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for it it's not gonna even matter
they're just gonna get stronger you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna make super mites so I recommend to
rotate a product if you can afford one two
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three good products spray two
products on day one and hit them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: third products on the next spray and then
two different products two different
[SPEAKER_00]: combos on the next time just keep
switching it up somehow sure they got a
[SPEAKER_00]: new way to try to figure it out understand
the mode of attack how does this product
[SPEAKER_00]: to work on the bug I am treating also the
first thing is identify the pest which
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to get rid of what are you
trying to fight if you don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'll never win identify the bug
then think about multiple methods of how
[SPEAKER_00]: to destroy that bug first of all make an
undesirable environment if they don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: being there if the leaves are sticky if
the leaves are wet if the leaves are oily
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to be around then attack
them a couple of ways some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products make them forget to eat the bugs
just walk around and they're like I should
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing something they don't eat they die
some of these products make a mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: grow out this little they eat this little
bacteria and it goes inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom or inside of the bug and it grows
out of them and makes a giant mushroom and
[SPEAKER_00]: they die and then the mushrooms decompose
it's kind of cool to see the little
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and videos of that happening but
understand the the methods and mode of
[SPEAKER_00]: attack some just stop them from being able
to reproduce so that's cool you got them
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't eat they can't reproduce and
now we're blowing them up with mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: and we made it sticky think about multiple
modes of attack and then also think about
[SPEAKER_00]: not letting them build resistance now
we're gonna kind of just focus in on a
[SPEAKER_00]: list of products that I wrote down
identify your bug I didn't understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide you're using and apply with
purpose and rotate your pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide now um let's just talk about
some of the products that I wrote down I
[SPEAKER_00]: like a product called the pyganic I also
like evergreen those are both pyrethrin
[SPEAKER_00]: based very similar products but very
different application rates I like as a
[SPEAKER_00]: max and as a trawl I think as a max is
banned in the commercial facility excuse
[SPEAKER_00]: me for the burps I also do like a product
called venerate venerate is a very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: product be careful with that one I like
botanogard max let me tell you what I use
[SPEAKER_00]: these for let me back up pyganic evergreen
as a trawl venerate those are good for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost everything but especially spider
mites botanogard max I will use the
[SPEAKER_00]: botanogard max as a spray for fighter
spider mites fungus gnats and then I will
[SPEAKER_00]: use it as a soil dredge for fungus gnats
or whiteflies also the pyganic and
[SPEAKER_00]: evergreen those make a great soil dredge
as well for fungus gnats and whiteflies
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're treating for whiteflies I
recommend you do a soil dredge and a spray
[SPEAKER_00]: application at the same time because if
you spray one and don't do the other they
[SPEAKER_00]: just move they'd go hang out in the other
spot they go you fuck up the soil we'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the leaves you spray the leaves they go
to the soil you got to do both when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: messing with the whiteflies for whiteflies
I recommend Monterey garden spray with
[SPEAKER_00]: spinosad spinosad is a bacteria made in
the bottom of a whiskey barrel and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: work very well on your whiteflies I also
like a product called cease cease is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good product I like smite and banish
however if you use smite and or banish
[SPEAKER_00]: rinse your plants off before the lights
come back on those products will cause
[SPEAKER_00]: phototoxicity I also like a product called
regalia that's good to keep away the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew and a lot of pests and an
outdoor grow I would use a lot of regalia
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like double nickel anything with
spinosad grandivo is a great product
[SPEAKER_00]: triact 70 is like one of my last lines of
defense if everything else didn't do it
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll mix in some triact there are other
products that are more abrasive more
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive I'm not going to talk about
them here today I don't want you to use
[SPEAKER_00]: them if you want to do your thing it's
your grow it's your ethics but I would not
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend it another great product if
you've got soil bound problems like
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies fungus gnats and you want to
drench that soil something that works
[SPEAKER_00]: really good is mosquito bits it like your
local hardware shop maybe target
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely Home Depot and Lowe's they sell
things called mosquito dunks they look
[SPEAKER_00]: like little it's a red package with yellow
writing they look like little shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: donuts in a package there are six of them
small six shitty donuts I will take one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those and crush it up into like a very
fine dust and then put that in my
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir with my water and water the
plants with that you may see some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chunks floating around that's just fine
inside of those mosquito bits is a
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria beneficial to the
plants not so beneficial to the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats and whiteflies it'll wipe them out
so give them a soil dredge with fun with
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus now what is it called the
mosquito dunks in there and that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe out soil borne pests and they're
super cheap and affordable those products
[SPEAKER_00]: are really cheap and readily available you
can get that at your local hardware shop
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully if not Lowe's and Home Depot
will have it over there in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: center all right so I was losing my breath
I tried to go fast I got my shit back
[SPEAKER_00]: together really quickly I'll go through
the list pyganic evergreen azotrol
[SPEAKER_00]: venerate botanic garden man seese smite
banish regalia double nickel Monterey
[SPEAKER_00]: garden spray let me add tangle foot to
that mix you can get Monterey garden spray
[SPEAKER_00]: and tangle foot both it like your big box
hardware store so if you're limited on
[SPEAKER_00]: resources and places to shop tangle foot
Monterey garden spray those will both be
[SPEAKER_00]: available at your local garden center you
can also use grandivo and triact 70 and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes don't tell anybody that I said
this but granulated sulfur is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: product for getting rid of a lot of pests
now that I've told you products that I do
[SPEAKER_00]: use let me tell you something that I do
not use I do not recommend neem oil I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like neem oil in the garden it
tastes like shit it doesn't go away it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the plants taste terrible and I also
don't like to use botanical oils like
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie oil sprays rosemary oregano oil all
that stuff I don't do that in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: why not because a lot of the stuff that we
grow turns into concentrates we make hash
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it and you can see when you're
making a concentrate you can see those
[SPEAKER_00]: oily pesticides float to the top I did
just tell you a bunch of stuff to spray on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that's gonna make them sticky
but you're going to apply it way early
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna last long enough to where
you don't have to apply it again and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will be gone they'll be broken down
evaporated dissipated and gone away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant before it is harvest time dry
cures smoke that shit will all be gone by
[SPEAKER_00]: then but those hippie botanical oils they
just leave that flavor I can taste the
[SPEAKER_00]: mint I can taste weird shit and the
concentrates and the flowers I can taste
[SPEAKER_00]: it when I get certain products so I don't
recommend that sort of stuff no botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: oils none of that neem oil stick with real
and my this is my opinion my
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation stick with the real
agriculturally recommended pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application if you want to really
strategically get rid of your pest if you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys want to use the hippie oils do that
also something I do really like another
[SPEAKER_00]: completely flipped option whole b-side to
using all these pesticides is why not use
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of predator mites you can
release swarski's hypoaspis miles
[SPEAKER_00]: persimilis kukumaris green lace wings I
know I went really fast on that but rove
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles all those guys will really really
help you out in your garden and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: harmless that way you don't have to smoke
oils that we don't have to spray things
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have to disperse the bugs if you're
growing in your home a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like that but for a commercial grow I
greatly highly recommend aggressive
[SPEAKER_00]: predator bugs once again swarski's
persimilis hypoaspis miles rove beetles
[SPEAKER_00]: kukumaris what else did I say green lace
wings get get the green lace wings that
[SPEAKER_00]: are on the cards and they are just about
to hatch they turn into little fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: alligators and those things will eat all
of the bugs in your grow all right ladies
[SPEAKER_00]: and gentlemen that is my rant on which
pesticides I would use I think I stretched
