[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the I
Grow Culture podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode number 46.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff and I'm coming to
you this week with a solo episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the day after Christmas and all my
friends are hanging out with their family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put together a quick show this week
and I'll probably do a short episode next
[SPEAKER_00]: week also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a wonderful holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever holiday you choose to celebrate,
I hope it was wonderful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge thank you to my mom for an
amazing Christmas gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot believe what my mom put together
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a big thanks to my queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot Angela.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made Christmas awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you spent that with my family and
I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your family now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I owe a big Christmas shout out to
the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me be a part of your
Secret Santa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt blessed to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm still dabbed out from the dab
gauntlet we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wearing the socks that I scored at
the Secret Santa exchange right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my Huff socks on and my feet are
nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a cold ass night here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, it's snowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's windy as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these socks came in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, I hope you're warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week is New Year's Eve actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be at the String Cheese Incident
concert in Broomfield, Colorado with my
[SPEAKER_00]: lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a little mini vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next week and this week will be kind of
easy shows without a ton of info.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do promise you guys that I'll get
back to the original format with tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: info and great guests at the start of the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The holidays got everybody in chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all growers and we all have jobs and
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the guys just decided to hang
out and not do a show with me this week,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who has been on
the show, who's taken some time out of
[SPEAKER_00]: their life to come put in an hour,
an hour and a half with the I Grow Culture
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The listeners love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a few people to thank and a few
things to remind you guys of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into too much of that
part, let's pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with Nature's Green Remedies.

[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Denver store at 6271 Beech
Street or the Pueblo location on 618 East
[SPEAKER_00]: 4th Street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, if you go to the 4th Street location
in Pueblo and there's no parking,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a right, right at the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a taco place right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then turn into the alley kind of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that first door is actually Hygro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's parking in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go park back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot easier to carry your stuff out
of the back also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that Hygro runs a special for
the podcast listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you check out at Hygro, tell them you
listen to the Hygro Culture podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: they will give you commercial pricing on
your entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they had a whole bunch of advanced
nutrients stuff at the point of Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: location and they're dying to get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went in there and made them an
offer on a bunch of advanced nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: products, I bet Burn and Jesse would hook
you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them, I listen to the Hygro Culture
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff said to come in here and get these
nutrients and they'll give you a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this podcast is also brought to you by
our good friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treethugger.com, live music lifestyle
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: www.treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to all the sponsors for
making the show possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: That song that just played was from the
Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let me play all of their music on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every episode I try to give them a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're socal reggae, kind of funk reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a lot of cool stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably going to play in your
neighborhood sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kids travel around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they are in Europe right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last pictures I saw, they were in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's good to see the Mystic Roots
band in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're just out having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're playing,
but all the pictures I've seen is just
[SPEAKER_00]: them on vacation, and that is
well-deserved, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are having a great
vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kat and Coot and the Mystic
Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a bunch of comments and stuff to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I want to do first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just smacked the microphone with the
papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have taken a bunch of dabs
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to remind you guys that we're
going to change the name of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is not going to be the
iGrowCulture podcast for much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be called the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said before, there's an
agricultural educational entity that has
[SPEAKER_00]: the moniker iGrow taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I was told that iTunes doesn't
appreciate people ripping off the I.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to change it to Grow From Your
Heart because that's what this is all
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow your herb, your cannabis,
your medicine from your heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will produce better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't grow your cannabis from your
wallet or your ego or your camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I take a lot of pictures,
but I grow dank herb because I grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I'm able to take the dank
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not thinking about my wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not thinking about the harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay attention to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm in the grow room,
I'm thinking about what's going to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: after I grow this herb properly,
after I flush it, after I chop it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: after I trim it, after I cure it,
after I give it to my patients that smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an older friend, his initials are
DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to call him out on the
show, but he's who I think of when I think
[SPEAKER_00]: of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good friend of mine and I'm his
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see him consume the herb that I put
my love into, I can see him get something
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of him feels better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just a physical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just him getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an emotional thing that happens to
that guy when my medicine makes him feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that emotional thing happens back to
me and it fulfills my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grow from my heart and you should
grow from your heart as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'll improve your outlook on
your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll improve your cannabis overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll improve your relationship with your
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just make things a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit growing from your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit growing from the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit growing from your camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit growing from your ego and grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our new motto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming with a new name requires a new
logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't change the name until I have a
sweet ass new logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you artists out there would
like to throw me down a grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast hosted by Rasta Jeff logo,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to tell you the truth,
but I would compensate you in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: that made you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take multiple gifts over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will work something out because I like
to pay back my community that helps me out
[SPEAKER_00]: and you like to help your community out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do me a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make me a logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse said it actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've ever grown pot,
when you germinate seeds, they crack open
[SPEAKER_00]: and the taproot comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that cracks open, it kind of makes
the shape of a heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could kind of make that into a
heart with the little thing coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but then make that taproot actually
turning into maybe, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get creative, but I want to see
that heart coming out or just whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: with a heart in it or grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I like red, yellow, and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Rastafarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, I've never said this on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to make a Rastafarian
themed logo, the red goes on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's red, gold, and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, red, yellow, green, but the red is on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually green, yellow,
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do that properly if you're going to
make me a logo because I'm a Rasta and I
[SPEAKER_00]: want it right because it's almost
disrespectful to put your logo with the
[SPEAKER_00]: colors upside down if you're bringing it
in a Rasta way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to bitch about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a real Rasta, you'll understand
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if I put the American flag
upside down, it would piss a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just imagine you people getting the
Rasta flag backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of frustrates some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give too much of a shit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just letting you know that you're
doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we need a new theme song.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds awesome, but wouldn't it be a
lot cooler if I had a customized theme
[SPEAKER_00]: song that was like something about grow
from your heart?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how it would go,
but maybe some dance hall reggae or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your job, not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's got a song for me,
I got the same deal for you as I do the
[SPEAKER_00]: logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some kind of kick down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado, I'll hand you packs
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get irie genetic seeds,
feminized or regular or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get more hoodies made.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the irie genetics hoodies are
being planned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're negotiating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to kind of hesitate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do it at the start of the
year just for tax purposes and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get some more hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get a hoodie out of the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just asking for a new logo and a new
theme song for the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast because I'm too busy putting
together shows and growing gardens and
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching people how to grow herb to
actually be able to make a new logo and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really have good art skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next part?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a ton of emails,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting so many emails,
tweets and Facebook messages about the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming in such a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for messaging
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The huge response I've gotten the last few
episodes has really inspired me to push
[SPEAKER_00]: the show to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting more time into the shows
and doing more research because I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep bringing the best show that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you guys message me,
that makes me want to try a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to step it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of tweets that I saved
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them in my phone so I've got to
search through the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just said I want to bring you
guys better shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring you a half ass New Year's Eve
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any guests or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd have people here,
so I don't have a lot planned,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to make it dope for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Party McFly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, Rasta Jeff, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, you can tweet me at the
iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at iGrowCulture or you can also tweet
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Rasta Jeff420 if you just want to
hit me directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check them both quite frequently,
like once a day probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude says, bro, I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first podcast I've been into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to start from the
beginning and catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm embarrassed that you're going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, well, let me not say I'm
embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm proud now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 25 episodes or so, I didn't know
what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned on the microphone and just
blurted out a bunch of shit and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of my face is how the show went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started making too many notes
and it got a little weird, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of comfortable with the
microphone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a few bullet points and start going
and it all comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so hyper critical of it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dude, Party McFly and the way you
wrote your Twitter handle is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even, I don't know how you did
that, but it's at Frivolous,
[SPEAKER_00]: F-R-I-V-O-L-A-S if you want to follow
Party McFly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for the tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you listen to every single episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to listen to them all,
they're on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the last 10 are on Stitcher,
but every single episode, all the way from
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning, all the way up to whatever
episode you're on, will always be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: iregeneticscolorado.com website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to change the tab on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a lot of changing,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going to be in the same feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're listening on iTunes or
Stitcher or whatever, the feed will still
[SPEAKER_00]: be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're coming to the website,
it'll still be easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lose me when I change my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be super easy, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Party Mc, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a bunch of dabs, a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made these dabs even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party McFly, thanks for messaging me on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next tweet came from Road Runner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at road underscore runner 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, listening from the UK,
still underground here, but great to see
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys leading the way for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those words of encouragement mean a lot to
me, like I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to hear that they're doing
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just put in a bunch of work
and nobody says anything and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, but you guys have been making me feel
like I'm killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten 6,500 listens on some
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episode with King Kola is probably
going to hit 10,000 episodes eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be the first one to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is remarkable because it's a newer
episode and there's been a lot of time on
[SPEAKER_00]: other shows and they haven't been listened
to nearly as much as the episodes with
[SPEAKER_00]: King Kola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to King Kola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And episode 35 with drying and curing also
has been a huge success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys haven't listened to that one,
it's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back and listen to number 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a recommendation for you,
35 and then the ones with King Kola.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could pause and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back and checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly think that from 35 on,
is where if 35 through 45 are some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: best episodes ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 44 is random chatter because we got chatty
and then 41 is chatty stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, the 35 through 45
are some of my favorite, most proud
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 more about organics with King Kola.
[SPEAKER_00]: 43 intro to organics with King Kola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some great episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 42 intro to NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got a lot of response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episodes about building your grow 39
and 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those really crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 37 was planning your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That did a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 35 drying and curing definitely has
been listened to a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot, guys, for listening to
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know that you're paying
attention and liking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I turned on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab right quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some dabs sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mix of stuff that I recently
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: My homie, Spence, taught me how to make
this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually wasn't making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was letting other people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why not be self-sufficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is White Widow, Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's no cookies in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's White Widow, Golden Goat,
Flow, Ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Gorilla Glue number four in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some Lemon Jeffery in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is quite a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys take a dab with me, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to Giddy up
in Emotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting this G-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it turned on for about a month
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't turned it off, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was a big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this G-nail has not given me any
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a USB port on the front that'll
charge up your phone so you can plug in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've only got a limited spot of
plugs, you can plug in your E-nail or the
[SPEAKER_00]: G-nail, and then you can plug in your
iPhone into that and charge your phone
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're taking hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Giddy up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came right before Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the tweets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Jake and Emily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I just yelled into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the software fixes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Jake and Emily for the
emails they sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be in touch very soon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't responded to a bunch of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been the holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been a little overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get back to you, I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys said some things, and I'm
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a big thanks to G35.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even ask, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can be G35 if he wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brent M and also Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for all your
interaction messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweets, emails, Facebooks, all of the
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the emails, guys,
so keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them to iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, I'm going to have to change that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make another email address
since we're changing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just keep that and I'll forward it,
but we'll make up another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 50 is coming up, you guys,
and I'm planning a small celebration
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get as many
microphones as I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get that many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: My software or my setup here, I could
probably put in 20 microphones with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the inputs and other inlines I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to get Adam and Jesse and maybe
Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Matty, you're invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have Matty on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be great to have the first chick on
the show be you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the first woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say chick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sexist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have the first woman on the show be
Matty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to correct myself there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like your guys' input about episode
number 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few questions for you,
so if you want to email me or tweet me,
[SPEAKER_00]: now's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, what were some of your
favorite moments on the podcast so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: What stood out to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's an episode or a moment that
stood out, tweet me and tell me what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to celebrate that on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you guys learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something that you learned that
really stood out that really... Like,
[SPEAKER_00]: have you ever heard somebody say one thing
and you're like, oh my God, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to this guy ramble for a whole
hour, and that's the one thing that made
[SPEAKER_00]: it worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got one thing that you learned or
something that really stood out,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you guys learned from
me or us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, who's your favorite guest on my
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of people on, Spence,
Jesse, Mike, Adam, Kingkola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addison DeMora was on the show via
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my most proud because that
was my second episode and I called up
[SPEAKER_00]: Addison like I had a podcast going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of funny of me to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should try that again and see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to know, what would you guys
like to hear next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot and why not make it be about
something that you guys actually want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I'm just going to talk,
you can tell me what you want me to say
[SPEAKER_00]: instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of me just rambling and rambling
and rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me some input, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tweet me at iGrowCulture or you
can find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a personal Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys find that, I don't accept
every friend request right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of, I'll troll you a little bit and
see who you are before I approve your
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff because I'm getting, if Facebook's
getting weird, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be that open anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see, I'm completely open
with the iReGenetics stuff and the
[SPEAKER_00]: iGrowCulture stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is fair game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tweet, I Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, my iReGenetics Instagram blows up
and I'm going to brag a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom spoiled the shit out of me for
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows that I've been looking at this
Nikon camera and so on Christmas,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gifts were all done and then she slid
this other box toward me and just smiled
[SPEAKER_00]: and had a tear in her eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I opened it, I kind of got a tear
in my eye also because she hooked me up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Nikon D32, the D3200,
the package with the extra lens in the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been eyeballing that thing for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks, mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's why I shouted her out at the
start of the show, but holy shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, that's the one of the best gifts
I've ever gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to discredit any other gifts,
but I mean, holy crap, that's the camera
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been eyeballing for months and moms
bought it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again, mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that my Instagram is going to
improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see better pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see more angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see more zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see better, better,
better, just because I've got better gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been shooting those Instagram shots
you see if you follow me on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those shots come from a Panasonic Lumix
point and shoot camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was $199 at Best Buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm pulling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I've upgraded to this freaking
badass camera, I think you'll see some
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But follow me on Instagram if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iGrowCulture or iReeGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of stuff on iReeGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post about every three hours I try just
to keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crap, guys, I'm dabbed out and I feel
like I'm talking really, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a big yoga breath together and
slow down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the sound of me calming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that shit sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to calm down for this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend whose name is Deacon
Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deacon Gray is a comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Oklahoma, but he currently
resides in the great city of Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've gone to a show at ComedyWorks,
there's a good chance you've seen Deacon
[SPEAKER_00]: Gray as an opening act.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little white haired dude that tells
weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about being from Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hilarious, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deacon Gray has made me laugh my ass off
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I'm going to go to this website
that I've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to search through it real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm stumbling because I was trying
to be somber about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to back up one tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deacon Gray, this page is called Help
Deacon Gray Grab Cancer by the Throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help Deacon Gray Grab Cancer by the
Throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deacon was living his life and slinging
his jokes and doing his duties as a new
[SPEAKER_00]: talent coordinator at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was hunky dory, except that his
friends say hunky dory when he noticed he
[SPEAKER_00]: had a lump on his neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm, better have that looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he had it looked at, and they wanted
to look at it a little closer,
[SPEAKER_00]: like take a tonsil out closer,
which they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad news?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cancer, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a highly curable kind of cancer,
the same kind the Nuggets coach George
[SPEAKER_00]: Carle beat recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: His prognosis is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: His spirits are good, but he's got several
weeks of chemotherapy and radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says click more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read all this to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm headed for is Deacon Gray has
made me laugh my ass off several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's funny as fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tells weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: His delivery is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in return for making me laugh,
I want to shout out his website so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can raise this guy a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got throat cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get him through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't smoke cannabis right now because
he's got throat cancer, but he can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely eat edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you live near Deacon Gray and you
see him, lay an edible on him,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give him some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a good, clean, quality edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, go to giveforward.com
and search for Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for the, it just wants to show
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giveforward.com slash fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go to giveforward.com and search
for Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's D-E-A-C-O-N, and then his last name
is Gray, G-R-A-Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can donate as little as $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody on here donated.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the last donations that I saw was
$1,000, and I thought that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could give somebody $1,000 for
their cancer treatment and help,
[SPEAKER_00]: but man, I will contribute a little bit to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't disclose how much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my personal donation, but I will
donate to this cause as soon as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving the tab open so that I can do it
right after the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd appreciate it if you guys just
went through a couple bucks toward Deacon
[SPEAKER_00]: Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to beg for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's got throat cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laughter is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give forward and help out
Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, I'll read out his website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giveforward.com and just search for
Deacon Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really close to his goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to raise $10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already got $4,120.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's almost 50% of the way through 39
donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deacon Gray, shout out brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you get to hear this somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope somebody relays this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made me laugh a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the least I can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to go and read a news article
that kind of hit home for me because,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you'll understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the agriculture podcast, but I'm also
the guy that owns iRead Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am iRead Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse is actually part of the team now.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of his stuff is available through me
yet, but it will be very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jesse is part of the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse grows, follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see his projects coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll understand why this hits home
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article was written by Jason Blevins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from the Denver Post originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was published December 24th at 5.05 p
.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, pot growers new quest,
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patent protection for cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Holmes gently lowers the turntable
needle onto the album and traffic's
[SPEAKER_00]: medicated goo begins to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Winwood's wistful tenor sweeps
through the centennial seeds laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: My own homegrown recipe will see it
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone stole from Steve Winwood,
Holmes says, his foot tapping as he
[SPEAKER_00]: injects a syringe of dark syrupy liquid
into his gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is stealing from Holmes,
a self-taught scientist, engineer,
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, and cannabis seed geek who next
month will take a rare step to apply for a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent on a laboriously created cannabis
super strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is awarded, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patent on Holmes medical grade auto two
strain will be the first to protect a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant and a first step in
establishing plant breeder rights for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who only a few years ago were
considered criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry came up in stealth,
born in basements and crawl spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: Holmes said, but now with companies
forming and making larger investments,
[SPEAKER_00]: the desire to protect intellectual
property is becoming paramount,
[SPEAKER_00]: bleeding edge stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of hits home to me
because I breed seeds and I create strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and I see people, I don't want to say
ripping them off because I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: they thought of it before me, if they just
happened to post it to Instagram after me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people, we like to borrow names in
this industry for strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we're coming up with something
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to hear a thumping
noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm moving this microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sliding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to tighten this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tighten up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry if that sounds like shit in the
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to censor or edit that out
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making stuff, my strains get stolen
often and I can't complain about it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm actually using other people's
strains to make mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody had to make the seeds for me to
breed with, but just give credit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now people are going to be able to
patent stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm worried about mainly are
people with more money going to punk me
[SPEAKER_00]: and patent my shit and squeeze me right
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to see other people claiming
that they own Capelton?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know the legal parts of this
enough to know, but I do know that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any money compared to a lot of these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am small time compared to a lot of these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to Greenhouse, compared to the
Cali Connection, compared to DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys could squeeze me out
tomorrow if they wanted to, but luckily
[SPEAKER_00]: we're a friendly industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big business doesn't give a shit about
friendly industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll squeeze us all out by doing this
kind of stuff because they've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I fear, but I'm a paranoid
hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on too many fish parking lots to
have a clear head about that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just always think the paranoid part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me read more of the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: damn, that's such a great cliche in one
fucking sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got pie-eyed long hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see those guys pie-eyed long
hairs all, I'm high and I got big eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a long hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So haphazardly hurling pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just got this male plant and
they're just beating it into the room in
[SPEAKER_00]: the jungles of pot plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no strain selection here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put a bunch of females in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm just talking shit about this
sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping to meld two strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's top readers are geneticists,
taking years to weed through carefully
[SPEAKER_00]: engineered generations of cannabis to
elevate the most desired traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a pretty accurate statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the new super strains are high-end
cannabidiol or CBD, one of several dozen
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid chemical compounds in cannabis
and the plant's major non-psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aw man, I was proud cause he said chemical
compound, but then he said ingredient and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that ruined him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so critical of these guys' articles
and I bet I say some really dumb shit on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast cause I'm high, but these guys
have editors and proofreaders and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just here spouting it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken dabs and drink mate and can't
be held accountable for anything I say
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD has been credited with relieving some
epileptic seizures, prompting widespread
[SPEAKER_00]: calls for additional research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop killing powdery mildew that plagues
grow operations across Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like we only have that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have powdery mildew all over the
place, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why you're singling out
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit ranting about that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get more into the article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some super strains are simply super stony
with sky-high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the
psychoactive compound in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta scroll way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like seven ads here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gas chromatograph is Holmes' key in
shaping auto-2, a high CBD, low THC strain
[SPEAKER_00]: he hopes can fuel medical therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 50-year-old gizmo separates molecules
and converts them into an electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: impulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: A green line tracking across screen
reveals the THC level in the substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That line will be the baseline for a
measurement of auto-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holmes produces a well-worn label
tablet-laden with acronyms and millivolt
[SPEAKER_00]: values from the gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those figures reveal his painstaking
progress toward breeding the THC out and
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD into his treasured varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in many ways the result of a
lifelong career dedicated to breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, cloning, engineering,
and charting the most useful cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Wynwood sings the oft-covered Dear Mr.
Fantasy, Holmes shares his plans to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect auto-2, which ranks among the most
valuable of his collection of 400
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of cannabis seeds, both
marijuana and hemp, most of which are
[SPEAKER_00]: stored in an additional freezer in his
Lafayette lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the patent, he hopes to be
the first cannabis breeder to secure
[SPEAKER_00]: protection under the Plant Variety
Protection Act, the Seminole Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders' Rights legislation from 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of that seed long-term could be
very, very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: An annuity, said Holmes, a father of two
who serves on the state's Industrial Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Advisory Committee and is collaborating on
the University of Colorado's
[SPEAKER_00]: groundbreaking Cannabis Genomic Research
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys haven't checked that out,
you should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Cannabis Genomic Research
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link to it in this article on
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can find this article on the
cannabis, it's the article about pot
[SPEAKER_00]: growers' new quest U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patent protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This link is in that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone who does this wants to produce
something with durability, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seed with good utility that produces
well can have longevity for generations,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read a few strains that I can keep
those seeds around, and that Capelten,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bounty killer, will be good forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get back into the article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of a random rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Holmes is sort of a modern-day
Luther Burberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burbank, who you should read about,
guys, the pioneering American botanist and
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulturist who developed more than 800
varieties and strains of plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 1800s and early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Luther Burbank, if you want to
Google him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wikipedia, that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burbank faced intellectual property
challenges in his career as he created
[SPEAKER_00]: still-herald peaches, plums, daisies,
and the world-dominant Burbank russet
[SPEAKER_00]: potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holmes follows Burbank's lead,
offering a few types of seeds to a single
[SPEAKER_00]: large distributor who can flood the market
in the first year before anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: can take it as their own a bunch of them
until I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time copycats have cloned Holmes'
strains, he already has made his money.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also licenses the use of his heirloom
seeds, but not the extra special seeds he
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't want copied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really the focus, minus any patent
protection, is non-licensing and careful
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of distributors, Holmes said.
[SPEAKER_00]: State trademark protection can safeguard
the name of an innovation within a state's
[SPEAKER_00]: borders, but protecting intellectual
property through state law is a bandage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patents are exclusively federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is illegal under federal law,
and federal law trumps state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy could get completely denied
for his attempt at patenting his cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, but if he does, he's going to open
the floodgates for a lot of shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people will start patenting their own
strains, I bet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means I'm going to have to get on
the game, get lawyered up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: harder for a lawyer that knows about
patent laws too.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, this game is getting so vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have your hands in everything
now to be able to keep up in this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to move to Colorado and
get in the cannabis industry, I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: you do like a year of research before you
get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe come here and talk to somebody who's
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can help you out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know a lot about getting into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like into, if you want a
dispensary or something, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to get you into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be hard, so be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I want to talk about in this
episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about the new year is
coming up, and the new year is always a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says they want to do new year's
resolutions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good time to start a new
grow calendar or a schedule to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: make a game plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up your grow room, get everything
started fresh again, and then instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just cutting a bunch of clones and having
a bunch of plants and veg and having some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit over here and some more shit over
here, think about what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how many lights you have in
each space.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many flowering lights do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants fit under each of those
lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do they take to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you got about 65 days underneath
this light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in about 65 days, you need more
plants to go under there, but you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple days to clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to sweep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to wipe the walls down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to clean all the dirt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to repot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get shit back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that in like nine weeks,
you need more plants in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you got to cut clones about three to
four, maybe five weeks before that,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how much space you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get your shit ready,
so start planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good time for you guys to
start working on an advanced grow
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it your way is what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll make an episode out of that,
but it's the start of the year coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just make a calendar, because if you
pop a bunch of seeds, you cut a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, and you got a veg room full and a
flowering room full, and you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: full plan of where those plants are going,
you're going to run into some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overcrowding causes problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overcrowding promotes problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see that plan on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell there was a spider mite
infestation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got spider mites everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got way too many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be diligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think ahead of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be five steps ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you be a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to predict what's going to happen in
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just watch and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, oh, this is going to happen,
because I've grown weed a million times,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've paid attention at least 10 of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm ranting again, but that's
really important, I think, and it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of the year, so it's time for that
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a good time for all of that,
and clean up all your shit right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your carbon filters are all mucky,
buy some new carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your bulbs are all shitty, get some new
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spoil your gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spoil you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my personal advice from the heart
of Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I must be dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying from the heart of Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to wrap up this
episode, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you join me next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be another quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go see the string cheese on
the 29th, 30th, and 31st.
[SPEAKER_00]: The string cheese incident at the
Broomfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first bank center in Broomfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you happen to run into me, say what's
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably wearing an ivory genetics
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks,
and there's a little short chick with
[SPEAKER_00]: dreadlocks next to me, and she's sweet
looking, it's probably me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of people that
match that description, but I'm probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing the ivory hoodie, and she's
probably got the ivory hoodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to remember to take some stickers
or something with me, and throw them in my
[SPEAKER_00]: back pocket, so that if you say what's up,
shake my hand, give me a hug, I'll give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really funny when you hug the
wrong hippie, because there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of tall white guys with dreadlocks
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what's up to me at the string cheese
incident, if you see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll smoke down or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have some dabs with me if we're not
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I'm going to sneak my rig
into the show, but I'll definitely have a
[SPEAKER_00]: spliff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, happy New Year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys might be ... When are you
listening to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might hear this on New Year's,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me look at the calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: When does this come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: When does this come out, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into the calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to press pause on the
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try not to do any editing
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like it when I just talk a lot and
don't ... Do you like it when I talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: my life and my stuff, and I don't just
keep talking about weed and have it all
[SPEAKER_00]: scripted, or do you want me to keep it
tight?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will come out on the 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit, you guys are probably ... I hope
you're listening to this on your way
[SPEAKER_00]: driving to the cheese show, wherever you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see me at string cheese,
give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next ... Happy New Year also,
because Wednesday is the New Year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are safe, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drink and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye out for each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be able to see all
your friends again tomorrow.
