[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 5354 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, a professional
grower, if you're a new smoker,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who's curious about the current
state of cannabis, this, my friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll up a fat joint, grab a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are joined today by King Kolo once
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: His real name is Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call him King Kolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call him Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll alternate between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got an alter ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a superhero and shit over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the organic as fuck superhero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ross Kolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across the table from me is our
good buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, dude, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to let Jesse talk a lot on
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you have a lot of good shit to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed up with the sheets,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jesse brought notes and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for coming, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: On time and everything, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to give a big shout out
to the Mystic Roots, man, for letting me
[SPEAKER_00]: play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, huge thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Kat and Coot and the Mystic
Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do an ad, but Sean just said
something that really got my attention
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that NPK value no longer matters
to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to elaborate that now that
I've got some microphones turned on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I think NPK with organic,
true organic gardening isn't a necessity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that is, NPK value is all
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was invented for synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a way to sell them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just giving the plant what they
need, when they need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason I brought this up to you is
I actually saw a post earlier today,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was out of a publication.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just read it for you real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give credit to who it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so this is Plant and Prosper.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't follow him on Instagram,
it's plant underscore in underscore
[SPEAKER_03]: Prosper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw him throw this up earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Justin von Leibig.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's actually credited with creating
synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a little excerpt that Plant
Prosper posted from a book that he was
[SPEAKER_03]: reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: NPK gardeners owe their practices to the
great scientist Justin von Leibig,
[SPEAKER_03]: the father of artificial fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: What most don't know is that later in
life, von Leibig acknowledged a grave
[SPEAKER_03]: mistake in relying only on chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, he saw negative impacts of
artificial fertilizers on life in the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: in his own vegetable garden, and
thereafter preferred organic matter to
[SPEAKER_03]: inorganic chemical fertilizer he invented.
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote von Leibig, after I learned the
reason why my fertilizers weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: effective in the proper way, I was like a
person that received a new life,
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding how nutrients will make us
work, will make us all see the light,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then ultimately make us better
gardeners with more sustainable gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, kind of butchered that at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, that's pretty much been your
message the whole time anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the synthetics are disrupting the
eco-life, the organic life, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and that we need to get away from
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And have I said on the show that you
brought me a book kashi bucket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I said that yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last show I mentioned I was going to bring
it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got to give you a big thanks for
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and shout out to the Rocky
Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean brought me a Bokashi bucket,
so I'm one step closer to becoming organic
[SPEAKER_00]: as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ordered one last week too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll be Bokashi buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say that out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a little weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the growers are like, sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else is like, what the hell are
those guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the purple Kalanji.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Kalanji club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winston and purple too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a lot of pictures today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Kalanji Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sweet strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were you saying about the NPK?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, basically NPK was created with
synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of the basis behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give plant nitrogen when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give the plant phosphorus and
potassium when they need it, or when you
[SPEAKER_03]: think they need it and you buy perhaps
this nitrogen natural process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by doing that, when you bypass this
process, basically you're just leaving the
[SPEAKER_03]: salts, the mineral salts and everything
that's left over from the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not immediately taken up by the
plant's roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're leaving that in the dirt because
you've bypassed all natural chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not being digested.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not being broken down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stays there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what you were saying about CO2
in synthetic rooms in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing that, you know,
I'm going to have some numbers on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically if I just drank
Gatorade all day or something salty all
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say Gatorade because they'll see
the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I drank some, if I just put salt
water all day, that's essentially what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're feeding the plants by feeding them
synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you'll pee out the water,
but the salt stay in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, it's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to say, but I flush
heavily, but you don't flush often enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you get runoff, that salt is still
binding to your, because your plant has to
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does metabolize is still
coming out of the roots as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the extra buildup you put in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the part that was never used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got the part that was
metabolized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a lot of salt stuck in there using
the synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then it also forms the plant
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in the plant materials as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to smoke those salts, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you rolling up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're a couple of feet away from
me and that shit smells delicious over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear it's getting stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I brought the Wi-Fi Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wi-Fi Tahoe smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you grow that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I picked it up from a local shop up in
the Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to that local shop in the
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the MPK, we don't rely on the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We rely on more of what it's called the
nutritive cycle theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant's a baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs things to aid in its vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where your nitrogen comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where your potassium comes in to
help strengthen those cell walls as your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants get bigger to make sure that
everything's going properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of giving the plant directly what
it needs, what we'll do is we'll let the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant decide for itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those things will be available in
the soil and not in the sense that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to load it down with alfalfa meal or
bone meal or blood meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the soil will have an MPK value.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, I calculated last time and just
with the real basic mix of neem and
[SPEAKER_03]: carrage and kelp meal and things like
that, I think we were running around like
[SPEAKER_03]: a 3-2-4 is kind of what the fertilizer,
quote unquote, was coming out at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fairly low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure that plant got everything it
needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's where we come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the reason that when you go to the
grow store, you'll see that organic
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers are like 1.23 or these
extremely low numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people see that and they're like,
oh, the other one says 0060.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to yield me way more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a common misconception.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you will get bigger buds using
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to be the tastiest or
the cleanest in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ate a bunch of pennies, I would feel
full, but I'd just shoot out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pennies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wouldn't get anything from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll argue that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not necessarily going to get bigger
buds from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the 0060, that sounds like a
powdered bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things can really fuck your
plant up in a hurry if you try to go too
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, as far as the whole MPK
thing, I wouldn't stress it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd make sure that when you go into your
cycle, make sure your soil's amended
[SPEAKER_03]: properly, and then make sure that you're
feeding it beneficial bacteria,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's getting everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll have alfalfa in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll have kelp in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need that booster, you can always
top dress with a fish bone meal or make a
[SPEAKER_03]: nettle tea or a yarrow tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many different options.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those, while they may not be high in
MPK, that's what they're predominant with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you enter that into the soil,
that's going to get the bacteria and the
[SPEAKER_03]: fungi cycling whatever nutrient you just
ingested.
[SPEAKER_03]: You enter it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're just going to keep carrying on
that process and keep delivering it to
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant as your plant needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your plant know when to stop eating
at that point?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be like, oh, so you don't run as
much risk of burning it with the organics
[SPEAKER_00]: as something I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I really first got into it,
I kept getting a lot of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiencies at the beginning of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, every ran I did organic,
it would just, for some reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just get these yellow ass leaves
week three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to follow your feed to keep up and
try to do everything you can to chase it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but week three, if you're already
yellow and it's a lost race.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that it was because I wasn't
feeding the plant enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't necessarily the case where I
really saw the improvement was when I
[SPEAKER_03]: dialed my amendments back, when I really
slowed things down and was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I'm not going to pound it with stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make sure that the soil food
web's alive, that everything's cycling how
[SPEAKER_03]: it needs to, that everything is working
and we'll let the plant decide for itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't dealt with the deficiency in a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't ran comparisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't run traditional growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't say that you're going to yield
compared to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just transferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made the switch back to full
organics in my indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been using bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took the clones, my first set of
plants that we transplanted into a good
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never fed them any bottled nutrients or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wasn't any flushing involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I use the soil mix that was pretty
much what I'd been using previously when I
[SPEAKER_01]: grew indoors and I nitrogen burned some of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first half of the plants I
transplanted used one amount of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs and I got yellowing instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people could have been like,
oh, that's lack of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I already knew there was a shit ton of
nitrogen in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next night when we transplanted the
other half of the plants, I just cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount in half and use the half amount of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those plants just exploded instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're still outgrowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's been three weeks ago and
they're still outgrowing the plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: we transplanted the first night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go easy with the organics because
they're bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are that's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they don't have to do as much work
to eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can speed them up too much by
overfeeding them with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we're talking about
with one of our favorite products is OGT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sean was teaching me how OGT can kind
of speed up the metabolism of your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go easy on the OGT guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been recommending that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replace that with Rocky Mountain worm
castings if you're able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering when I heard, I listened
to the podcast last night, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering if that could be useful in
flushing in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it can.
[SPEAKER_03]: It absolutely could.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a lot of good sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're a super huge fan of OG
BioWare.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started using them here recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so impressed with OG BioWare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm talking just from the
standpoint of the plant's overall health.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I haven't seen a damn yellow leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's green and waxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but that goes to the new patch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had read somewhere that somebody had
actually mentioned hitting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're only supposed to use the
nutrient pack, I believe three times
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I heard them about introducing it a
fourth time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, about like, or not even into flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were saying like around like
week, you know, a couple of weeks before
[SPEAKER_03]: flush actually like really start cycling
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, that's definitely
something worth looking into.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to have to start taking
a lot of notes on these next few episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have Sean back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean wants to do a full episode on
recycling soil and reamending your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a listener ask specifically about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, FastBerry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who you are, but you're an
awesome person.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate you listening and
your input.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to let Jesse talk a little bit
or a lot actually about, he wants to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain is blank today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to talk about light deprivation
and getting a head start on the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean's got a bomb he wants to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to drop it now or do you want
to put people in suspense and give this
[SPEAKER_00]: new idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we'll bring it out on the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the next time that Sean comes over,
he's going to talk about reamending
[SPEAKER_00]: recycled soils and then he's got a bomb to
drop on the entire growing world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to either, you're going to
hate me or you're going to love me,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we're going to change the way you
think about a certain item that most
[SPEAKER_03]: people are using regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that I know is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's using regularly in their
lineup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use it regularly in my lineup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just learned this too, so I'm guilty of
it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably give you two weeks to study
up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably skip you on one episode
just because we don't want you too many
[SPEAKER_00]: times so you don't get stale and expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just ash run on the table,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, perfect tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm too lazy to get up and get an ashtray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll have you back and we'll let you
drop that bomb on the show and disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's growing mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to do a couple of commercials
because I did not do them and we're about
[SPEAKER_00]: to let Jesse talk a lot.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what the coupon code is for
this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to update you in the next
episode, but make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to interrupt you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what it was, but it was
25% off and that's a hell of a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can find that coupon code,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone on Instagram was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out
naturesgreenremedies on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like green remedies nature or
naturesgreen or something because
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is kind of a bitch and they've
been killing people's pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Yankee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I don't have a coupon code for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to figure out the date that this
show posts because if this goes out after
[SPEAKER_00]: February which I think it does,
then I need a new coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to post one up at the end of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Code is what I'm writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since Jesse's here, this podcast is also

[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely saves you some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying a big bag of soil,
it definitely chops down the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used it today myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saved myself four and a half bucks on a
bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four and a half bucks counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it cheaper than everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That coupon code is actually better than
the employee discount I'm supposed to get
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.

[SPEAKER_00]: How do you spell it actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at K-I-N-G underscore C-O-L-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew there was an underscore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an underscore between the words
and at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to the Rocky Mountain Worm
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now an official sponsor for the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will write them a really super ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not sure how to advertise that
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ads sound the same, to tell you
the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're great guys, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get them back on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, we're going to have the
guys from... I shouldn't even tease you
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dragonfly Earth Medicine people are
going to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunt, Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for you to come be on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody send the Grimy Gatsby an email
and tell them that they need to be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of love to all the sponsors for
making the show possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to sponsor the show,
just send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you all the information that you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't forget that there is a
donation button on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the iregeneticscolorado.com website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top right, there is a donation
button.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like donating a few dollars
for the time that I spent putting this
[SPEAKER_00]: show together, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to know that it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that, do that, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's time to let Jesse talk
about light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of notes over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to just let you go about
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to ask you a couple of
questions I had written down?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think it's cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a good starting point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then get started, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't have as many notes as it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even read most of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really big print.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: This top paragraph or three is the
important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was written by either Eric or
Jonathan from Forever Flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to shout them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great guys, great products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found it on a website called the
ganjier.com, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a great website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joint break.
[SPEAKER_01]: So light deprivation, this is just a
definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can taste the Tahoe in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having trouble and I've always had
trouble explaining light depth to some
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will use someone else's definition of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light deprivation, AKA light depth,
is the process of forcing plants to flower
[SPEAKER_01]: with sunlight in a time of year that is
not normally the flowering period of the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun's natural light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to controlling the light cycle
with the grow light by turning it on and
[SPEAKER_01]: off with a timer, farmers can control the
budding cycle by blocking the sunlight and
[SPEAKER_01]: making the plants think it's time to
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, this is done with the hoop
house or greenhouse of some kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's not actually necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my track.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll recap a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll recap a little while you catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what we're trying to do,
we want to grow outside, but we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little bit of a jump on the outdoor
season before the police and thieves go
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our trick is to build a greenhouse
outside or a hoop house, which I'll let
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse explain how to build a hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's our construction guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we need to do,
we want to put our plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outside, we'll put them out early
before we get to our flowering cycle that
[SPEAKER_00]: nature gives us with the sun, the sun
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo period is what makes these
plants flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to trick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover up our outdoor
greenhouse or hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover that up every day at
the same time and let them sleep for 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and then uncover it every morning at
the same time so that these plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: tricked into thinking that the season has
changed to fall and it's time for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we can do this with the... If you
schedule it right, you can get these going
[SPEAKER_00]: four weeks, maybe three or four weeks
before everybody else is in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull off one crop before everybody
else and that shit won't get stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can... Shit, I have it all
figured out because I'm doing it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put your plants out April 25th
here, you will harvest July 30th,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because nobody gets a harvest till
late September, early October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid-October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's with the 65-day strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to worry about any cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get that freeze that
everybody worries about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our region possibly a little bit in
the early season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put plants back in there and
re-flower them, couldn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually... You can get two runs
out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two runs easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen three runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I've seen four runs,
but that was with a forever flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, forever flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a hoop house or a small greenhouse is
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are trying to do this on a
small level, the smallest level of light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation I think you could do,
put a couple of potted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to use a seven gallon or bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, some people... This is for the
guy that's just trying to do one plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: himself or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your seven gallon... A lot of guys are
going to use a five gallon bucket from
[SPEAKER_00]: Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're going to go get.
[SPEAKER_00]: 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up 44?
[SPEAKER_00]: So 44, you take your... And 44 was kind of
doing this last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your five gallon Home Depot
bucket with your big ass plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day at six o'clock or every day
at seven o'clock, whatever time you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose, you got to pay attention to what
time the sun goes down, get that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: go put it in a closet in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put it back in your grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, put it in your grow room or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a small operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put it in the room for the night and
let it sleep every night at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it has to go back outside under
the sun every night or every day at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you give that plant 12 hours of
consistent, 12 hours of darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted every night, you can do a
light depth like that and use the sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the trick too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't actually have to put it back out
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just have to wait for 10, 11 o'clock at
night, safe time, sun completely down,
[SPEAKER_01]: no lumens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then use your farmer's almanac to find
out what time the sun goes up that
[SPEAKER_01]: morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically you're probably getting your
first actual... This is from Jonathan,
[SPEAKER_01]: a Forever Flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not this smart, but you get your first
lumens probably before the sun actually
[SPEAKER_01]: comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take 20 minutes off that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it before the other way of seven
and seven, and it's very tedious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take it back outside,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sun's going to set at eight o
'clock, bring that plant in at seven o
[SPEAKER_00]: 'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it chill out before you go to bed at
11 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go put it back outside because it's
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you got to find out what time the sun's
going to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be 6.30, seven o'clock in
the summer probably, depending on where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy a pot, a big ass pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy some soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy some Rocky Mountain worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy some Gro Kashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of cool other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Azomite a little bit makes that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean's going to teach you what to put in
your soil in a couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put all that shit in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a nice clone of some grateful dog in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw that sucker outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's free weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could use a garage,
a shed, you know, anything if it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people take a big ass trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a little plant, you take a
little big 30 something gallon trash can,
[SPEAKER_00]: drill some holes in the bottom of it so
that you got airflow and then just set
[SPEAKER_00]: that bitch right on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them do that for hailstorms,
but also seen them do that for a shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure it'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be, you know,
it's not going to be the most amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to teach these guys how to
do a hoop house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a quick, since you're the man
with the hammer and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real simple one is just you need a gravel
pad or an elevated area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you don't need it, but you need
drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps it from being a muddy mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus, I'm stoned again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the mistake of not smoking all day
before coming at Jeff's.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you show up at my spot, it's dab time
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a pregame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got to warm up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, take two by fours,
lay them down on the ground, screw them to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other, make a big rectangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight foot by let's say 12 foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need two eight foot, two by fours,
two 12 foot, two by fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a rectangle pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Handful of screws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build that, stake it to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of different ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A piece of rebar or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then nail the rebar to the two by four
with a fence staple or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then take you, let's see, eight or 12
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing construction math.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say at least six pieces of at least
two inch PVC would need to be at least 12
[SPEAKER_01]: or 14 foot long, I think, to make the
entire hoop over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the front you'll screw,
basically you're just going to bend the
[SPEAKER_01]: PVC into a hoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, into a half circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're making kind of a, it just looks
like a really cheap greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll use some clamps,
like some conduit clamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even just screw straight through
the PVC into the, but I mean, you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: secure it to the two by four somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a 12 foot greenhouse, I'd put up
four of those pieces of PVC or four hoops
[SPEAKER_01]: and then use one as a skeleton beam down
the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be at the peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attach it with zip ties or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a really windy area,
you'll probably want to beef up your
[SPEAKER_01]: material a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the front range of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you, you know, just throw some
plastic over it and boom, you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some thin see-through plastic right over
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got a weatherproof or
weather resistant greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so now you basically built this
big rectangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've secured the rectangle to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took PVC and made arches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just made one, two,
three, four or so arches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got one at each end and then a
couple in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take that one right down the
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just drape plastic and secure
the plastic at each on the bottom on each
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you let it hang and you get,
make some on the front back too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you just leave the front back open?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wanting to do it cheap,
I just really recommend leaving them open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get some airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get, unless it rains
totally sideways, you should be legit,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can have the plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that greenhouse is good all year,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can use that for, if you don't
want to do light depth, that's a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap little, little hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can produce a bunch of cannabis in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: An eight by 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a lot of pots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys get, get some seeds going or get
some clones cut now, because you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to get these suckers outside
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is real time stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegem inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't actually addressed this,
but Vegem inside to the size that you
[SPEAKER_01]: would normally flip a plant or even
fucking bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top them a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fim them if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our light depth plants are fucking
gigantic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean- And they're terpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're as big as an outdoor plant when it
starts flowering outdoors, an in-ground
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional or natural light cycle plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the yield is, I'm not going to
say numbers, but it's very much worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will definitely pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that outdoor cannabis is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sun does amazing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouse cannabis, you know,
it has been protected from the wind and
[SPEAKER_01]: rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot more frostier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks a little more like indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think greenhouse weed is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly prefer it to indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sun terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't match that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this hoop house and it's
pretty much weather resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's eight by 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: How tall does it usually end up?
[SPEAKER_00]: About seven, eight feet tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually about where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I was thinking of in my head would
be about seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the one that I've pretty much
been in one that you've built.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in two that were side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what we're dealing with
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get some big ass, your plants can
finish seven feet tall in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get gigantic with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some guys in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have scissor lifts to pull
the plastic over and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, I mean, just huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the part we're going to have to
talk about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make this light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to put our plants out there
when they're waist high ish, maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm tall, so I can't really judge by
that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're about 36 to 42 inches tall,
you want to start inducing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can't just flip the light like
we used to indoors to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to do it like Jesse was
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to use some sort of cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to use some kind of tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need, if you've got, if your
greenhouse is 12 feet long and eight feet
[SPEAKER_00]: wide, you're going to need like 12 by 12
at least to cover it because that arch is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take a lot more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 12 by 15 or so, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just get a 15 by 15 tarp just that you
have plenty of coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make sure it's actually, it actually
blocks out the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to use two layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used, I get green tarps because of
the green spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposedly, you know, I don't know if
that's actually, yeah, I don't know about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the science behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, I was standing in there and I
was like, green tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is to keep out all of the light
because you need it dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever time you pick every night,
if you pick seven o'clock, you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what time the sun's going to
come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you pick seven o'clock,
you got to go out to this hoop house every
[SPEAKER_00]: night and cover it up with a tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's completely dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first few times you do it,
go in there and hang out, wait for like 40
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, just lay down and hang out for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close your eyes and adjust to the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can see any light,
if you can see any light in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make it darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I continuously do that through the season.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's with tarps and cheaper material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, forever flowering makes really
nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some money to spend and some
land to put it on, check out Forever
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering Greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not your backyard setup though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get just the greenhouse fabrics
from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're actually not too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also have a blackout tarp that's
breathable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's, and it's not too
much just to order the tarp from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can afford that, otherwise...
Totally sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to close the deal for you,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But damn, I lost my train of thought
thinking about their bitching hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Covering it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheap plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to tear throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, continuously check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have extra plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the tarp and then plastic over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to make sure I get a total blackout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't have any light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our point, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every night, this is the whole time
you're doing this, every night,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody, hopefully you, hopefully you've
got the dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's got to go out there every night
and make this shit dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every morning you have to go out
there and turn the lights on by uncovering
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to get some air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to get airflow in
there while it's covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about a way to get airflow in
there while you're covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might need a fan towards the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some air in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A trick I use for that is this also helps
keep everything secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean's dedicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just pulled out Forever Flowering
stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a business card.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Help you get in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them, yeah, I sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him once kind of, so yeah,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a dab session?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when they were through the greener
side one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No smoking allowed there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But shit, I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, was that like some sativa or
something in those dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually some lemon Jeffrey sour
diesel dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to warn me about that shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a sativa smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting here losing my shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of wiggling around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to sit still.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys would be proud of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I couldn't sleep last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dabbing this stuff, just going,
I'm trying to get tired and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dabbing it, dabbing hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally an indica guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the name of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse lost his train of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, just I'll remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light depth is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were just kind of talking about what
fabric and stuff you were going over
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
Ventilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a booster fan, like a 10 inch or
12 inch one, and hook the ducting to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: tie it to the side of the greenhouse so
it's up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't suck any dirt or anything into
the fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set that on the floor of the greenhouse,
plug it in, pull your tarp, hook to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: have like a six foot chunk of ducting and
pull that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrap the plastic around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make it do a couple of S's on the
ground and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the S's are where the light comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to bend your ducting to keep the
lights out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody tells you to keep your
ducting straight, but at this time you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to bend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you keep light out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that puts a negative pressure on the
greenhouse too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps suck the tarp nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got it sealed up good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use some timbers, rocks, whatever that is,
or whatever, to hold the tarp down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you pull it over, you can have
sandbags, but that'll be on the edges on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something heavy enough to keep wind from
lifting, taking your tarp away,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you sunlight when you don't need
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then squeeze clamps from Harbor
Freight, like big old alligator clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a jumper cable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use those to help secure it all to the PVC
frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also close up the ends, wrap the
plastic real tight and clamp the clamps on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a sweet structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some big ass plants to go in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you got some good irie genetics
or some gauge green genetics or something
[SPEAKER_00]: to put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the opposite with this also,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to keep your growing
season going longer, you can put lights in
[SPEAKER_00]: this greenhouse too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which sounds strange, but sometimes your
plants are going to flower earlier than
[SPEAKER_00]: you want them to in some areas,
if you're in a warmer place, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you may have to add a heater
later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to get two grows out
of it, like we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pull off that light depth grow,
hang up a couple of lights, veg some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do when the sun goes down
at night, just turn on one or two lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and those will keep your plants awake so
that they don't go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're ready, just take the
lights down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can get that whole other... It
can just be CFLs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to... Yeah, just enough to
keep them awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to stay on all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just walk through every couple of
hours with a light and it'll wake them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just disrupt that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't hurt them out because they're
out in the sun like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to get two full
harvests out of this cheap... You're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to put a heater in there by the
end of the season if you do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll get two full crops out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're doing 18 by... What are we
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 by 8?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 12 by 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fit quite a few plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to get you hyped up on
numbers, but... Well, it depends on your
[SPEAKER_01]: container size and your plant size too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're eight feet wide,
you can do either two or three pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, crown them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to have a walk space.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to get in there, just pull the
plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's freaking outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like to army crawl through your rooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big and clumsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave a little bit of dreadlock space or
I'll get a dreadlock hung up on a branch
[SPEAKER_00]: or something and ruin my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 96 square foot of biomass if you do
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping, lots of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the plants going.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 96 square feet of tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's a decent start on white
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys all have questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to email me or Facebook or
something, me, Twitter, me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's grow from your heart at Hotmail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bad habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Instagram me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call me if you know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because I'll get like text
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just listen, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, you should email me or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels weird getting it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of bad about answering direct
messages, but I swear I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I normally get to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not very timely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may take me a week, but I'll get to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to sit down and answer just all of
my emails and Facebook and Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: direct messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these days just go right through it
and empty out the inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes work though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you assign yourself tasks when
you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I can do this for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, oh, there's more
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already kind of, I'm already working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light debt takes a lot of dedication and
commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like ninja status.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the cost of the supplies,
the time you're going to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to pay for any electricity
and the sun is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're reliable with getting
out and covering and uncovering every day
[SPEAKER_00]: and not letting, keeping the airflow in
there and not letting it get stagnant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be cool, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when Sean comes to talk about his
soil recycling, we'll talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about keeping bugs away, unless you guys
want to talk about bugs in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spino said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about, yeah, how are we going to keep
bugs away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend ask me about caterpillars
last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a lot you can do about
them once it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just manual labor, pick them out,
cut away the rotten spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to call a manual and have them
come pick them out for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Pueblo thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a local joke, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually used to know a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told everyone that was his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his first name actually was Manuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we keep the caterpillars from
getting into the grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I was told those little fuckers
lay their eggs about three weeks before
[SPEAKER_01]: you actually see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when it's still pretty early bud
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's especially outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still stretching a lot at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just little popcorn nugs on shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Spino said is something I had great
success with last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it in a Monterey spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monterey bug spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually we don't have that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I bought it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have the Captain Jacks now too,
which actually has more Spino said in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then Monterey, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem oil, although I mean, Neem oil works
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about Spino said it's a,
it's actually a bacteria found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of rum barrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, it's good to be used.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be, it's something to be used
strategically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jesse was saying, it needs to be well
planned, thought out, talk to other
[SPEAKER_03]: people, figure out when they usually see
these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put my thoughts on Neem oil too
strategically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't just spray willy nilly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you want to, you want to apply for
reasons at certain times.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to get in tune with your
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you, yeah, you want to utilize
everything that you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, you don't have too many options,
especially here in Pueblo with our extreme
[SPEAKER_03]: weather and pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, you're high and dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was a spider mite, I don't want to
live here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen crops here completely
wrecked by, here goes organics again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen crops here completely wrecked by
spider mites and powdery mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've never had an issue with them
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've found that, you know, occasionally
you'll have some, when the plants come out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the spring and they're very easy to
deal with a little Neem oil, maybe some,
[SPEAKER_01]: like lemongrass based water is,
you know, very easy to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the bugs just don't like water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gardens I've seen wrecked by them are
neutral or bottle fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pouring fucking chelated nutrients
into the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think the, the, the big
problem is, is that it's usually in,
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes in two situations, either a,
they don't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they just get the infestation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's usually where they want to
come in and treat with like an Eagle 20 or
[SPEAKER_03]: Tetrazan or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the other situation is, is that they'll
actually use those things on a regular
[SPEAKER_03]: basis as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant builds no sort of self immune
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're all, you're doing it for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second that you forget, or the second
that that insect builds up a resistance,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've lost the war.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the trick is prevention.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really you want to go out systemically.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to add in neem cake and
crustacean meal, things like that into
[SPEAKER_03]: your soil mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to plan out spray regiments of
neem oil, essential oils, like he was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, lemon grass, peppermint oil,
rosemary, rosemary kills spider mite eggs
[SPEAKER_03]: on contacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you, if you see a little bit of an
infestation, your first thing is to go and
[SPEAKER_03]: remove any stippled, you know,
anything with stippling and then go back
[SPEAKER_03]: through and hit them with some,
rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have rosemary growing in my yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would I go about just taking the raw
plant and utilizing that into a,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can go a couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's either a, you can make it like
a traditional essential oil, which is,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea how to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just, that's just a quick Google
search.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really not that hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of like you, you know,
you mix it, set and forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you might have to apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some heat to it or things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other option would be like a cold
process, kind of like a ferment to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: extract those essential oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be more like a fermented
plant juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you would go, that would go back
to like the Korean natural farming that I
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of do where you would take the
rosemary or whatever plant you would want,
[SPEAKER_03]: mix it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, you could do mixtures of them
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do personally, I do ginger, garlic,
cinnamon, sticks, and then I'll grind all
[SPEAKER_03]: of that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it in with the indigenous
microorganism and EM1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's usually how I create.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll create a little, you know,
spray off of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a damn, I bet that smells
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my girlfriend actually likes that
when I spray it in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So damn, I'm like, forget what I'm saying
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to smoke different dads next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only took one or two dads and everybody
looked at me like, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so preventatives, stuff you mix up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you just want to, uh,
preventive, uh, preventatives are key.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to plan out your neem sprays,
your essential oil sprays, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: your spinoside, anything that you're going
to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to make sure that you have it
planned out on a calendar when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to use it before you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to make things like I was
saying, you want to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_03]: give yourself a month or two in advance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can make them and they'll be ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause these are, you know, 30 day firm
ends.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making warm casting teas and things
has taught me to plan several days ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to start it, you know,
12 to 48 hours before you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to apply it before it's even useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that foamy layer, which when you,
when you get used to it, it actually is
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of turns out to be a lot easier
because you're like, well, I'm on your way
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start this tee up and you'll hit it
the next day with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works out like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting away from the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got some hookah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoop house action kind of got some ideas
on how to keep away the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what was the one thing you talk about
a lot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Karanja meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so there's neem and then there's
Karanja.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear a lot of people talk about like a
neem and Karaja 50 50 mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big difference is that like neem oil
technically has, uh, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, almost like birth control style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, properties to it, which for human
health reasons and Karaja oil doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of my basic understanding
is that they're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically Karaja oil is a hell of a lot
cheaper to source or at least Karaja meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I can't, I've never personally used
Karaja oil specifically, but the,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's basically the same thing as neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me curious about these birth
control properties now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, if you really want some birth control
properties, go use Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make you stare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't get laid at all because your
eyes are twitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely birth control right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want her to see if I got over all the
stuff we wrote down because we're coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up on 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep this about an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed we get a lot more listens
when we go like 50 instead of a 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we ran out of our attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of my problem is I'm over here making
notes and reading shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are just high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got over all the stuff that I wrote
down on this page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I promised you guys, I'll get you a
coupon code at the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw that in right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, one of the cool words I learned
today, nutritive cycle theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to do that again and
read more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just made that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's new to me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of posts up about it on
my feed and then Rocky mountain natural
[SPEAKER_03]: farming's page.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a little post about it up because
make sure you check out the Rocky mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming and the Rocky mountain
worm company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All their internet stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will learn so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on the podcast, put in some headphones
and go type in Rocky mountain worm company
[SPEAKER_00]: and just find, just click on links and see
where you end up and see what you learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you read on there is useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just read it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you have a question,
just comment and ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll bring Sean back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like this guy asked this question
and Sean will come and he'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the answer young Jedi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll all learn to grow like a pro
here organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every bit of this applies to your
gardens, to corn, tomatoes, all that good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use worm castings on all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not just pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that, and you don't have to buy
everything at the hydro store either.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other stores and I hate to say
that since the hydro shop is a sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can go to the farming store and
the regular grow store there's a nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: around here that sells, uh, grow supplies,
but they don't have any grow lights or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but they've got lots of great
amendments and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a garden supply store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to those places too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, agriculture, horticulture stores,
supply stores, support your local economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know why you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't rub it in their face.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a garden store, man.

[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I mean, as always shout out to Rocky
Mount worm company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, everybody who's helping us

[SPEAKER_03]: Nick, you know, coming on last time and
obviously you for having us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on and giving me great
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you two are probably you guys and
Clint are my most listened to guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one's probably going to blow up
since you're both here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like superhero status.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Clint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come do a show with us sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Clint keeps his, he's like training
wheels because he's, he doesn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about Ken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not like, I'm not even being a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not know shit about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like weed ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be saying stuff and he'll look
over at me like, what does all that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got, Oh yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should tell everybody what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we just talked like pros and they're
still learning with training wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have them come ask us questions
about organics beginner, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a dude who doesn't even, you know,
come quiz us, come ask us the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked too quickly over and lost
people come remind us to slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you six questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that we'll give you six
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's never taken a dab before,
so I don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready to give a dude six dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my friend D said that he's coming to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a friend told him that his first dab
he's going to take is a gram dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been trying strongly to
discourage that from happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's insisting on taking a gram dab
for his first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These listen to my friends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know you and they advise
against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him he's going to fuck up his whole
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody's going to laugh at
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to look an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to eat and then go
lay down and then wake up like 10 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: later and eat again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to cough for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to look like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to feel like shit for
probably 30 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's coming from three people that
really smoke a lot of dads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do gram dabs and a gram dab is a big ass
dab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half gram is a little more than I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Point three is comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, and that's a big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people do about point one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just dick waving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, but yeah, there, there's no
need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Jeff has his reasons and,
and he's very aware that it's just dick
[SPEAKER_01]: waving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to take big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pretty good at waving his dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when, when that dad,
when you're not sure if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come have a stroke, a little bit of a
heart attack, or if you want to jump up
[SPEAKER_00]: and high five all your friends all at the
same time from a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, and that's what a point five does
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheerleader dabs, cheerleader dabs guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take a big dab, your arms just
start moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me an a, give me a B and you're not
even trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to the Josh blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, he'd laugh his ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Josh blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Josh a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hilarious guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned a whole bunch of stuff
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned how to build your own
outdoor hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're going to build a hoop house
in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're going to grow a whole bunch
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you, your neighbors, their
neighbors, their neighbors, and all your
[SPEAKER_00]: other neighbors are going to be like,
damn, whose weed smells so good because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody is growing a big plot of outdoor
cannabis this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want happens on a county
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang around on overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't bust us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't take down every crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow, grow, grow, grow, grow some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach your friend how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're teaching your friends how to
grow, teach one of your friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: teach two of your friends about the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you teach one person,
they'll get high and forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tell two people, the chances are
one of those people might come and listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So teach more people about the show while
we're teaching everyone to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your mom listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your mom listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your mom, make her listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might be, she might think that weed's
a devil and she'll listen to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problems we had today was we all
forgot what the hell we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse needed extra water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could already have ADHD, but I could
barely sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a very hard time sitting still
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're like the construction
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you build shit all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're like, I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta build things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I smoke indica, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's all cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made these lemon Jeffrey dads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone had some sour diesel the other day
and it was very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cousin Tater there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out cousin Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good cousin Tater.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a bunch of my genetics and he's
been killing it with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does well with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd give them a best new grower of the
year that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Adam, let's get Adam that award
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make Adam the best new grower of the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta earn it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not giving it to you yet,
but that's what we want from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to be the best new grower that
we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're part of the grow crew now,
like it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does what he's told to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He puts the lotion on the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more whip for Adam again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to close the show with all that
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called Sean at like, I was like,
can you be here like a half hour for a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, sure, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, thanks for coming, dude.
