[SPEAKER_01]: and use their music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, across the table
from me covered in sweat, bright red eye,
[SPEAKER_01]: putting on his headphones and recovering
from a giant dab, it's White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, man, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just took a choker of a dab over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be dying right now, but I low-tempted
a little too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect, because I didn't need you
dying through the intro of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not used to that double bucket of
yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not used to the thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had I cooked my regular banger that long,
I would have taken a ridiculously hot dab,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'd be dead right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does take a little extra heat,
but the dab you get off of the thermal
[SPEAKER_01]: banger with the bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the bubble cap, that thing's
useless.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that little bubble cap, it wrecks
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, such a great, great dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you took a nice... What were you
dabbing over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some massive cherries from our
material out at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And processed by CSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the critical mass and the black
cherry ran together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the dab you gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job to our friends over at CSC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to start the show always by letting
people know what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, we're smoking on the massive
cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to take some dabs of some
platinum tangy here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will also smoke some Stardog PHO wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a whole bunch of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a nice pile of hash on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a fun party.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, I'm feeling a little... I
don't feel 100% super good today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a headache and I've got the
sniffles.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a fun show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got like a weird migraine thing
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to have some water and some snacks
and I shook most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dabs kind of made it go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I haven't felt 100% today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dab through it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dab right through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as... I noticed when... As a
musician, I noticed something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel like shit or you can be too
intoxicated or you could just be having a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you get your instrument
going and the music starts playing,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that shit just disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I hit play and heard the intro
music, I noticed when I went, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, my headache just kind of
faded away for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, all that good stuff will make it
go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 250, this is almost muscle memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but at the same time,
I'm not phoning it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's something that you do mainly out
of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as you start doing it,
your body remembers why and how much you
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're at the podcast table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw some dopamine and a little
adrenaline at you to get you through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we want to start episode 250?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start... I just wrote a note on
my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a whole list of notes and then I
wrote one more note on my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is episode
number 250.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is your first podcast,
if this is your first episode of the Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: From Your Heart podcast you've ever
listened to, or if this is the 250th
[SPEAKER_01]: episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast you've ever listened to,
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome to the show and thank each and
every one of you for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked to have made it this far.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said it was going to be episode
250, I was like, I don't care what I have
[SPEAKER_02]: to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be on that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you were on the first episode,
weren't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were not on number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin was on number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I was on number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam wasn't around quite yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Adam came just a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: My timeline's a little fuzzy since the
head injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff, I remember it, but down all
the pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got 50 or so hours of show on top of
that in my head just from going back
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to old stuff again on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many episodes do you think you've been
on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're recording on 10-7-17.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to mention that for archive
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I wrote that down,
but I want to mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What date?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote that down on 10-7.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is 10-9, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me pull up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 10-10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I made these notes a couple of days
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote the date a lot of times today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely 10-7.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look on Mike's face when I said 10-7,
he's like, oh, fuck, what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard 10-17 and I was like, no,
it's the fuck not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be taking a whole week away from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we got to harvest too soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't have three harvests in that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to start a podcast with sad news,
but man, we lost one of the greats,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Ralphie May, one of the best comedians
on the planet, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ralphie May, past of cardiac arrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ralphie May had been struggling with
pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know Ralphie May, he was also quite
large.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had been cleaning up his act.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was eating better.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was off drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All he did was smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hung out with Joey Diaz and did comedy
shows in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a resident comedian in Vegas and
they found him dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get to see Ralphie at ComedyWorks
South, not the small downtown club.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my first ComedyWorks experience
was either Doug Benson or Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure which one happened first,
but Ralphie May was a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a heckler in that show and I
have never seen a comedian fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A heckler like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ralphie May must have planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get to his status, you've got a
few in your pocket ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got anybody who messes with your
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crushed that fucking heckler,
rolled them up into a little ball,
[SPEAKER_01]: rolled them down the bowling lane,
got a fucking strike and then took a
[SPEAKER_01]: breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back to my bit now and just fucking
crushed his act just like he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he didn't miss a fucking beat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ralphie May was known as a partier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ralphie May liked to eat some mushrooms
and smoke a little weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite Joey Coco Diaz stories
involves Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to summarize here because
it's a great story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't listen to anything with
Joey Diaz, you should.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's offensive, so be forewarned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you like it as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey Diaz tells a story about performing
in a comedy club and a girl had cocaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know anything about Joey Diaz
and cocaine, I think he was more into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cocaine than the girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this girl had some cocaine and he took
her into a walk-in freezer in this
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, I was eating a monkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was putting coke rocks in her vagina
and snorting them out and they got caught
[SPEAKER_01]: by the manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was smooth enough to stick the bag of
coke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't promote drug use, but this is what
Joey does and he's a fucking adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joey steals the cocaine and sticks it
in a sock and dips and he runs upstairs
[SPEAKER_01]: and he tells Joe Rogan, hey, Rogan,
I just got myself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Rogan hands him a hundred dollar bill
and tells him, good luck, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joey Diaz starts walking on the street
like, I got to get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ralphie May drives by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or walks by and he tells him, Ralphie,
get the car, Jack, get the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, Coco, I got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, get the fucking car,
Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so finally fucking Ralphie gets the
car and picks up uncle Joey and they drive
[SPEAKER_01]: off and fucking Ralphie May rescued uncle
Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of their many stories they've
told together on the podcast, but that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: great story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost glad my life path never took me
into their life paths because honestly,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I think I would throw myself down
that path a lot harder than is survivable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I purposefully ducked pretty much
everything, but weed and psychedelics
[SPEAKER_02]: until I knew myself well enough to know
that anything that picked me up and gave
[SPEAKER_02]: me a bunch more energy was something I
needed to stay the fuck away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like those kinds of feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychedelics were my friend for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I went to a bunch of fish shows
and I'm a dead head and I'm into that side
[SPEAKER_01]: of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've, I've done my fair share of DMT
and more than my, I've done your share of
[SPEAKER_01]: LSD along with mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done everyone's share.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, if you, if you'd never done acid and
you're not into it, I did yours for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had that handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was, that was like the nineties
and early two thousands and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's way in the past,
but I never got into like the cocaine and
[SPEAKER_01]: the other weird drugs, like the
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be fucking woo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't feel like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought those were as a,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw people digging through
dumpsters to get a hit acid, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, you don't get addicted to
those kind of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm, what are you going to do Friday?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to eat some acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be back to a normal person
and go to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to keep my job up so that my
apartment can still be mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're playing in the band and
they're paying you an acid, then it gets a
[SPEAKER_02]: little, those lines blur.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things that like non
drug consuming people often don't realize
[SPEAKER_02]: is that like 98% of drug consumers,
you would have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consume drugs, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like because they just do it occasionally
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that drives their
existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that they promote regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a friend who has a name that is
a name of an inanimate object and his name
[SPEAKER_01]: got brought up today and somebody was
actually talking about the inanimate
[SPEAKER_01]: object and somebody was like, do you mean
this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, I meant object,
not person, but it's funny that you say
[SPEAKER_01]: that that guy's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, Oh, you know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started talking about his rampant
drug use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, dude does a bunch of
fucking drugs, but you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drug user.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that person had to think about what
they were saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He does do every drug on the fucking
planet, but he doesn't lie, cheat or
[SPEAKER_01]: steal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's not like addicted to anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just does drugs on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets really fucked up every Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the week, he maintains a
fucking life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only one anybody ever discusses or
that anybody really sees out in public is
[SPEAKER_02]: booze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everyone knows 50 people that drink
regularly, fairly heavily, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: influence or fuck up their life in any
dramatic ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sure shit might be a little better if
they didn't do that, but they get up every
[SPEAKER_02]: morning and they go to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come home, they have dinner on the
table for the family.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to bed, they get up and do it all
again the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go fishing on the weekends or to
Little League or whatever the fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one has any issue with it because
it's not impacting anyone else in a
[SPEAKER_02]: negative way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see it all the time with regular,
like that's why I was watching a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-pop videos yesterday, so it's kind of
on my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you watching anti-pop videos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Know your enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to know what they're talking
about so you know what's going to pop up
[SPEAKER_02]: on our radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the shit the anti-pop people are
railing about today is the stuff we're
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with in regulation 18 months from
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't understand at all the
history here or the numbers involved and
[SPEAKER_02]: the number of people involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you listen to them rant, as far as
you can tell, marijuana is something we
[SPEAKER_02]: invented around 2000, like 99,
2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just appeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: We manufactured this high THC Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a bunch of people who wanted to get
rich off an addiction for profit industry
[SPEAKER_02]: just showed up with it and started
marketing to children.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is it's always been here
through all human history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis has been around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Countless drugs have been around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for most of that time, most of the
consumers have had other shit they had to
[SPEAKER_02]: take care of all day and just did so
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: for enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went nuts with it 80 years ago and
here we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were afraid of colored people
raping white bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly it's money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money and votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money and fear and votes and control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us do what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't hurt ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some of us will, but we'll weed
ourselves out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard left, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring you right back on course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, this podcast is
brought to you by our good friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: TheDankTeam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to add some regular or
feminized seeds to your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: TheDankTeam.com is where you can find
Alpha Chronic, Mile High, Canaventure,
[SPEAKER_01]: iReGenetics, Rare Dankness, the Cali
Connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're showing me something.
[SPEAKER_01]: La Plata Labs, Sin City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember the old ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the old ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to repeat the old ad from the
early episodes, but I'm not sure who's
[SPEAKER_01]: still on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they've got a whole bunch of very
reputable and trustworthy breeders on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would highly recommend to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: TheDankTeam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know you're listening to the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got regular, they've got feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly suggest some iReGenetics or some
Rare Dankness or maybe even some Mile High
[SPEAKER_01]: or who's also really fucking cool and got
some seeds on there probably by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully Sour Seeds is available on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a pack of Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go there, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some iReGenetics seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they got that Storm Shadow from
iReGenetics, that's a really good cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's White Widow Cross to Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes big, giant, super frosty bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Storm Shadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered the Dank Team ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, look how far we have gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: 250 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just spend a rough week?
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost Tom Petty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost Ralphie May.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Petty got a shout out on the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like I'm missing somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm missing you, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make anybody else die with your
Ricky Bobby curses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I lost one of my dogs this week too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been a crazy, heavy loss couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about the past week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the past 250 episodes,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when we started this and it
sounded like this in the background?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounded like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we didn't have any compression and
everything sounded like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was none of these blinking lights to
look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't watch the green bubbles go up
and down with the level of my voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we sound all smooth like we are
NPR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it sounds nice and crisp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even big name people that do podcasting
now, when I listen to most other shows,
[SPEAKER_02]: like man, they need Jeff doing their
sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if your podcast is recorded through
your phone or if you've got a call in
[SPEAKER_01]: guest, half the time I won't listen and I
just can't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to hear quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: People deserve quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like honestly, it didn't like neither of
us are engineering experts or fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: electronic equipment experts like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were in the band.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know a lot more about this than your
average Joe, but shit, Google it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to Cliff Ravens, crafters on the
fucking minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, that's a good I was going to
talk about how proud and grateful I am to
[SPEAKER_01]: have done 250 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we started sounding like shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought you'd make 250.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured you'd do like eight and give it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get like five thousand downloads every
time I put out a new episode within the
[SPEAKER_01]: first 48 hours of releasing a new episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get about five thousand downloads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bounce between super proud of that
number and super like scared of that
[SPEAKER_02]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because every now and then it'll dawn on
me just like, dude, you've said some
[SPEAKER_02]: insane shit and like five thousand people
downloaded that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the shows that we've done that
were super in depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the numbers you've told me like,
oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the Fillmore Auditorium in
Denver?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We filled that twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how many people heard that twice
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I never would have said that on stage
in a room full of people, but it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: you and me and your little recording
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so comfortable here at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for joining us, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am grateful and I'm proud to have done
250 episodes and I'm going to keep keep
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing you more great content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've become a good ambassador
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be a good representative for

grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of want to thank all of the
guests that have been on here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't want to miss anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to try to say too many
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, Mike, Rob from Sour Seeds,

[SPEAKER_01]: I've never paid for anything and I've
learned fucking plenty from that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of information that
honestly, if you're doing a podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly, and you haven't started looking
for people like him to kind of help
[SPEAKER_02]: improve your show this way or that,
and it's not like, oh, every 30 seconds do
[SPEAKER_02]: something funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, he's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's a lot of really good
information on bringing together a tighter
[SPEAKER_02]: show, a more informative show,
a better produced show.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to get more listeners based on your
metadata.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a lot of tricks.

[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But big shout out to my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of times when I was
like, guys, I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sick as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need help doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Adam and Mike and Kevin all showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Jesse, a whole bunch of people
showed up one night and we did a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically sat here and looked at
everybody and nodded and ran knobs because
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys put out a podcast for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks to all my friends that support
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all my friends that share the
podcast, not just the people that come
[SPEAKER_01]: over to the house and record, not just the
people that hang out at the dab table,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just the people that I work with that
support me, but my friends out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: all my social media friends, the people
that I interact with online, the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't interact with online,
but I try to because I'm overwhelmed with
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said a couple of names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who wants their names set on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're missing people,
but I feel like I don't want to stop and
[SPEAKER_02]: go back and listen and make a list.
[SPEAKER_01]: His initials are A-L and he made some
seeds and he shared some seeds with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he wants his name said,
but shout out to that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite episodes I did was with
Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, old Doug is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug, I don't know if you listen,
dude, but much, much love and respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people that I want to
mention, but it's hard to remember
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the people that helped me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I owe a huge thank you to the
always lovely, always beautiful Miss Jenny
[SPEAKER_01]: Beth.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: She lets me get my podcast done.
[SPEAKER_01]: She needs me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She needs my attention and it takes me a
little bit of time to get this done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: All the listeners that trust me,
you guys that you send me questions and
[SPEAKER_01]: you count on me for quality advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you take some advice to take advice you
heard on a podcast and take it into your
[SPEAKER_02]: own garden and try it on your children?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your children, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like part of what made me start
this podcast was I was reading a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit on forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would say, oh, you've got this kind
of bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake up a Mountain Dew and spray that on
your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would mean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, what the fuck are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: People would tell me like, oh,
just grab this random thing out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: house, grind it up and dump it in the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or somebody told me half a jar of molasses
per gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you need for food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on in some of your grows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pour half into one gallon and half
into the other and make it hot,
[SPEAKER_02]: hot water and then stir it up and pour it
into your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was advice I was sincerely given
is though that was the trick they were
[SPEAKER_02]: using to make their.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the things I would see online,
I would, I would see that just causing two
[SPEAKER_01]: more problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got rid of your bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got sticky ass Mountain Dew on
the tops of your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're going to get more bugs stuck to
that and your leaves are going to look
[SPEAKER_01]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to cause eight more
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever put Mountain Dew on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it was a terrible joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's part of why I wanted to do a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I wanted to write a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm going to write a weed
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, a book changes every
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like weed changes, cannabis changes,
the industry changes, the rules change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't write a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I'd write the outline and look
up something, well, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got to update this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A podcast is cool because it evolves every
seven or five days in my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can update you guys and be like,
here, remember what I said six months ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: New tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found a better way or a more
efficient way or a cheaper way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks to everybody that trusts me
because a lot of people send me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, you can see all these emails
right here in this folder.
[SPEAKER_01]: People send me stacks of emails and that
means that those folks trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that the information I give them
is going to be well thought out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know the information I give them will
be tried and true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know that I am not selling them a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I will recommend some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things that you can buy that
will help solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am not paying paid by any nutrient
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not paid by any pesticide companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no money coming my way from
anybody right now, honestly, for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can hear it in the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you listen to other shows,
you can tell when someone's brought you by
[SPEAKER_02]: cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of what inspired this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there was another weed podcast that
the first half of the episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would read emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd say, well, I would go to the
store and buy product A and then turn off
[SPEAKER_01]: the lights and spray the fuck out of
product A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your problem will be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would go on and act like the
show is natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 30 minutes into the show,
they'd go, well, now we're going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the ad would come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast brought you my product A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd be like, oh, is that why you
recommended product A at the start of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they paid you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fake email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody had that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made that shit up so that you could
pitch that product to make some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to make some money off of
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to be able to do it for free if
it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what I use and you can use
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the tips and tricks that he's using
personally and his success with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not getting recommended because
there's a percentage on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's totally what I would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned products like Grandivo and
Evergreen and Cease, things like that we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually use in commercial cultivation
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would recommend all of the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, we had a guy ask you, what do you
think about ladybugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave verbatim the same answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not word for word, but incredibly
close, that you gave on the podcast three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what we use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's where you can get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's why they're superior to ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dude was blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: His eyes got really big and I could see
him itching to take his phone out and
[SPEAKER_02]: start writing shit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladybugs are cute, you guys, but most of
them end up in your ducting and in your
[SPEAKER_01]: shop vac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladybugs are great for photography,
but I don't think they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some Swarovski mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to do you good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to do a lot better work
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you guys for trusting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you trust me because you
continue to send me emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You continue to interact with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You continue to tweet me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you continue to send me messages
on the Instagram and you keep listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that lets me know it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do put a lot of work into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you just hit record and you
talk, but I've got pages and pages and
[SPEAKER_01]: notes and thousands of dollars in gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot going into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to know that it's worth all
the effort to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we do just get really high and
hit record.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only reason we're able to do that
is because two years of homework went into
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't going to be one of those shows
where you need to get out your notebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not going to be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could turn it into one, but it'd be a
real dick move at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hide it at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it like an Easter egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last like eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, we're not going to do that to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be number 250.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, when I started this podcast,
I honestly felt like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's like, dude, if you want to call it,
we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason I handed you a hash that
tastes like cherries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drank two bottles of water and the
second one has a packet of emergency in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's vitamin C and electrolytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ate a bowl of noodles and a
handful of snacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really put me back on my game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just getting talking really got
me gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel a lot better now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for bringing me back out of my
coma, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I was going to say was,
since it's episode 250 and we're chatting
[SPEAKER_01]: our faces off, we're going to take a
couple of fat dabs here in a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a couple of seconds to
get to that because I know that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be so fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see your list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this just occurred to me that I wanted
to send a huge shout out to all the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that have emailed the show over the years
and all the people who are thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: emailing the show in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last couple of episodes, like I
haven't been over here on a show and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't even tell you how long Barry could
tell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Barry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, Barry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so happy to get that tweet from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been itching to get back over here,
but the last couple of shows that were
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy email based were really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved the parenting show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that's not a show that dawns on
you without that prompt from the listener.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not exactly I wouldn't have
called you and been like, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's do a parenting show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I'm a new parent, I'm thinking
about that shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a couple of friends who are parents
are like, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have been on that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, I know, but I know sometimes I
can't I can't get everybody on the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, honestly, I want to I know what
day I want to record.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal is to record on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes it'll be Tuesday night and I
can't sleep and I mean, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just get up and record a show at
midnight and I'll just record it just
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm in the mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like podcasting is maybe maybe
not everybody would feel this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's kind of like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm in the mood to do it,
I should do it because it's going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: out way better than when I'm not in the
mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you guys have heard at least one
or two episodes and I'm like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuckers on this episode fucking phoning it
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple of shows where like we
just couldn't trim anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we needed a long break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like go and grab a bite to eat and come
back and get back to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did a show and then we chilled
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got back to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the eyes uncross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the hands on cramp and just sit and
chill for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a shout out to everybody that emails
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do appreciate all of the interaction,
even though I can't respond to all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is I work a 40 plus hour a week job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I've got my I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run that company as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I've got the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I've got my own personal
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I'm a father that should have been
way higher on that fucking list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for failing at life right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I've got a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just failed at life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, dude, I'm getting emails from one of
the bosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting emails from an applicant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my emails from the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is never stop our bosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We it's my kids bedtime plus 12 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I should be doing story time right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the lead cultivator at Three Rivers
and Mike is the metric guy at Three
[SPEAKER_01]: Rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we stay busy with emails from bosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the front of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the back of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We meet in the middle and talk about a lot
of stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're involved with every decision made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we try to be involved with every
decision made with that business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do stay completely busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do interact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I interact with as many of the emails as I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times I just get at you when
I'm pooping or falling asleep or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do what I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I print most of the good emails out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, when I come over and join those
shows, it doesn't help because let's try
[SPEAKER_02]: to do three emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: This show becomes like we got through most
of an email this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you get a little chatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's working because like I'm going
to segue into my next bullet point nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoothly here this week on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are ranked five hundred and ninety
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crushed overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are a lot of shows on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to research how many in one
section I saw twenty five thousand and
[SPEAKER_01]: another section they boast forty thousand
shows like forty thousand titles of
[SPEAKER_01]: different shows are available on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know which is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody wants to do the real research
and find out and tweet me, send me a
[SPEAKER_01]: tweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at GFY podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know because that way I don't have
to search for it and I can put that energy
[SPEAKER_01]: into a good show.
[SPEAKER_02]: The part of that question I like is that
for your show, it doesn't matter so much
[SPEAKER_02]: if there are twenty thousand or forty
thousand because you're better than all
[SPEAKER_02]: but five hundred and forty of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I was hyping myself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I want to be on that top one
hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I thought about it like we're a
cannabis show, like we're a very niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a very niche show here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends where you look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis consuming population is
somewhere between like 10 and 25 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: of the population is like everybody's good
guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: My real guess is that you'll take a couple
of hits at a concert or a few times a year
[SPEAKER_02]: is closer to 40 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, even then, that's fucking
pushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like other shit that where
they're pulling 20 million views a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of people that listen to
podcasts and the amount of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke cannabis and the amount of people
that actually give a shit enough about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to listen to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a small pocket of people
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I've noticed, my demographic
is the exact same on my Instagram feed as
[SPEAKER_01]: it is on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people are from Denver to Los
Angeles or Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 80 percent of them are men.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them are men between like 21
and 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mostly who's listening to my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to leave you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like your female friends to listen to
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't draw the ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a lady magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they could see the Chewbacca costume,
I think things will be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was ranked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were ranked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show was ranked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me, it's my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was number 39 in Lifestyle and Health
on Stitcher Radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, number 39 in the Lifestyle and
Health category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys for listening on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, thanks for all the wonderful
comments on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have not gotten anything but five
star reviews on iTunes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 250 and nothing but five stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's what's what's awkward
about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't list you in a lot of shit until
you get a negative review because like who
[SPEAKER_01]: cares about all these positive reviews?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get a negative one to fall
into their algorithm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like you're just trolling
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you just beg for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't do that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it, Barry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five stars all around you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing keep the streak alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to edit that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just taunted all five thousand
listeners just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do not do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that five star rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I want to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday shows, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you listening to the Throwback
Thursday episodes that I put out every
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been putting out what I call the
Throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me explain how, who, what,
when, where, why and how I'm doing all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is iTunes and Stitcher hold
100 episodes in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being that this is episode number 250,
that means there's 150 episodes that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get to listen to because they're not
in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm doing for you, because I love you
guys, I'm making old episodes into large
[SPEAKER_01]: three or four hour chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some smart ass shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from his heart, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, I'm taking old episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really does give up his computer for
like six hours per Thursday show so he can
[SPEAKER_02]: post that bitch to all the streams because
it's three hours and change usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out of the long show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually like three, maybe four,
sometimes five episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to have to Denver it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that have long jobs that are at
work all day, they love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take old episodes and I put them in
chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, instead of putting one episode
in the feed, I can give you four episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: put them back into the feed, and you can
listen to that old shit without knocking
[SPEAKER_01]: out a bunch of new content.
You get to go back
[SPEAKER_01]: and listen to that old shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no harshness.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just sent a little thing saying,
hey, by the way, that's already taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: We immediately started working on a new
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, on episode 50, we'll drop the
new name and we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first 20 episodes are on the old
iGrowCulture feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 through whatever, 99 or 100 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are like 105 episodes in that feed,
but only the first 99 or so are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are on the Grow From Your Heart feed
on YouTube, so search for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click subscribe, follow us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get enough videos caught up,
I may put up other random videos,
[SPEAKER_01]: like other stuff that's not actually
podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may put that up on that channel,
just pictures of me doing random shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want to get caught up first.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit a ways away.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, when I was talking about the
Thursday shows, I said there was something
[SPEAKER_01]: else I wanted to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is totally random.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know me and you were here when it
happened or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't cheat because this is going to be a
contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
Kat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike already won.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contest is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got another idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you get a prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a kick in the dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here it comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the magic of radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a prize though, and I'm not
going to tell you what the prize is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it depends on your location and
your age.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were here in Colorado, it's fucking
cooler than it is if you're in fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: Delaware.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll look on Mike's face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I picked Delaware.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Delaware.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a t-shirt and some
stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Thursday episodes, during the intro
music, there are several voices hidden in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several voices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's a voice backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can tell me who the backwards voice
is, I will give you a prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's one that goes, oh shit,
Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can tell me who that is,
I will give you a prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not fucking cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were here or if you know,
don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a dick move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want not cheaters to win this prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to listen and then maybe
somebody will know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody will figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 and Kat aren't the answers,
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are not the answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people's names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you have a friend named 11,
and we do have a friend named Kat,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that is not who- I only have a friend
named 44.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess 11 wouldn't be that strange of
an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, 11 would have been better than 44,
if you know why he's called 44.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywho, but there's a prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not promising you what the prize
is, but I'll send you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you nail one of those, there's a
backwards thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can nail who the backwards
voice is, and then if you could tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: who says, oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two chances to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two winners out in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the backwards one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's it going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can tell me what they say,
front words, you get a bonus prize because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fucking challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the backwards voice to identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a totally different voice says,
oh shit, Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify that voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a prize in it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is this mixed into all the intros for
the Thursday episodes, or just one
[SPEAKER_02]: specific that they got to go find?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I used the same one on episode
240.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look in my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk for a second about something,
and I'm going to go look in the phone
[SPEAKER_01]: here, and we'll see which two episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about, well, they can't be too far
behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to be wrong on the
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 48 and 248 and 246,
but my phone's opening it up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I better turn down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to go playing through the
fucking, if anybody was curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was listening to the Joe Rogan podcast
with Whitney Cummings on it last is what
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like I was listening to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throwback Thursday, number 248 is the
episode you want to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I just play it right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, but then that would give,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Mike said, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to listen to show a little
initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to win the prize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go listen to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prize is much cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're over 21 and you live near me,
the prize gets much fucking cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some imaginary lines that limit
prize capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, bullet point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next bullet point is shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a tiny flow dab on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that dab and then I will talk about
this bad news I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will take another dab after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is the rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to pause and dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we'll just keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is number 250.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done shit yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are we going to press pause for
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, the plane engine sound that
you're about to hear, that's the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn down your mic just a little bit
so that you don't hear Mike dabbing and
[SPEAKER_01]: coughing too much over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk for a minute while
Mike gets a dab going for himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of people out there
that I want to talk about for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to send some love and some light
and some support and some words of
[SPEAKER_01]: encouragement and a thank you and a whole
lot of stuff all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many years ago, I stumbled across a guy
known as Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy out there called Subcool and
he runs a company called TGA Genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Green Avengers, Team Green Avengers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Subcool and his wife, I'm not,
I'm pretty sure that's his wife,
[SPEAKER_01]: known as Ms. Jill, MZ period Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms. Jill are known for breeding some
amazing strains of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give Jill credit because we're
going to do ladies first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jill bred a strain called Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard me talk about Jilly Bean on
this show a whole fucking bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't heard the name Subcool and
Ms. Jill, but you listen to this show,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've definitely heard about their work
and things they've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ms. Jill has created the Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms. Jill also created Brian Berry Cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian Berry Cough was made for Jill's
friend Brian, who had a, it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, it's a condition, a disorder
called ALS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a syndrome is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be correct on those types of
things, but he had something called ALS,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a terrible condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Gary's disease, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in a wheelchair and he couldn't
control his body completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was, it was sad to watch,
but Jill loved him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were friends from school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she bred Strawberry Cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got Kyle Cushman, Strawberry Cough
from Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they bred Space Dude, which is their
Space Queen male, which is the equivalent
[SPEAKER_01]: of my King Solomon Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their version.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same strain or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that's like, I've got the
Arise, they got the Space Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their staple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bred that and Ms. Jill bred that and
made the Brian Berry Cough for her friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool is famous because of many strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apollo 13, Space Queen, Vortex,
The Void.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me turn that mic down for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Void.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many good strains that came
from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Team Green Avengers also does Doctor Who,
The Nine Pound Hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those things are coming from that
camp and that crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember how far we used to drive
for Vortex?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to drive, I live in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a dispensary in Colorado Springs
called The Clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is at exit 102 or 104.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one's Colorado?
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to go all the way up to Colorado
Boulevard in Mexico and Denver to visit
[SPEAKER_02]: the clinic Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would buy all of the Vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vortex hash they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that they would let me buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would buy all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Vortex hash was fucking amazingly
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a trip where the van was like
half full and we were all buying you
[SPEAKER_02]: Vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just everybody go get the limit of Vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy it and then I'll give you guys a
bonus for doing this for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, if you look at my photography
and if you look at Subcool's photography,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is very obvious that Subcool inspired
my grow style, inspired my photography,
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pull from a lot of sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool being one of the main influences
when I started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just very available.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a show called The Weed Nerd where
he will teach you a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool is TheWeedNerd420 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably live right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to log on and watch,
he's doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool inspired me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Jill inspired me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool taught me about breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool taught me about growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool, the plush berry that I made black
cherry came with came from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The space queen that I made space bitch
with came from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kissing Subcool's ass because I love
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He inspired me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without Subcool and Team Green Avengers
and Miss Jill, there would be no
[SPEAKER_01]: iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be who and where I am today
without that inspiration and a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of guidance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent a lot of time watching Subcool
shows and just learning, absorbing,
[SPEAKER_02]: learning to think in things in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first few times he interacted with me
on social media, I didn't know what to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, how do I reply to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to like take a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I don't think he even realizes
how much he inspired me and how much he
[SPEAKER_01]: taught me and how much I paid attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have called me mini Subcool online
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a joke for a little while,
but we're similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny says I'm quite like Subcool,
which I think is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, what I'm getting to you guys is
Subcool and Miss Jill had a very nice home
[SPEAKER_01]: in California and the fires destroyed
fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wildfire in California burned down
their entire house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far at this point in time, Sub does not
know if the safe that they closed just
[SPEAKER_01]: before they left, they contained all of
the TGA seeds, that safe could be
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know if that exists or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get back to their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is ongoing, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that happened already.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the house burned down a couple of
nights ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're staying in a hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sub's putting it all on Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all basically public info.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to send some love out to them
is basically what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm letting you guys know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever... So Sub can't get to the
house to find out if those seeds are even
[SPEAKER_01]: alive because the mother plants that TGA
breeds with burned in the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of their plants, their plants are
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot make strains like the void,
vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all gone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother plants that did that,
the male plant that did that, that shit
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to have to start from
scratch unless one of their friends has a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone of the space dude, because that was
what did it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sub and I were in talks of him sending me
a space dude clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just hasn't all evolved yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to do a collaboration
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a space dude clone
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have it to send back to him when
he gets on his feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't happen yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes timing is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes nature is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you've ever grown anything from
Subcool, Ms. Jill, Team Green Avengers,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've grown Dr. Who, nine pound
hammer, vortex, space queen, the void,
[SPEAKER_01]: plush berry, there's so many strains that
this dude is responsible for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plush berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the one I'm thinking of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Time wreck, blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's time wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: The list of strains that came out of TGA
is just intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been at it for so long.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can hear me shaking up my water
on the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my emergency drink here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have grown any of that stuff,
you guys owe a little nod toward TGA at
[SPEAKER_01]: least.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do anything, if all you can do
is go to Instagram and message Ms. Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Ms. Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you search for Ms. Jill with a Z,
you'll find there's no I.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's MZ Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them words of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jill's having a rough time with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jill's taking it worse than Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sub's a fucking soldier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sub will not acknowledge that he's got
feelings because he's a big manly man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I would probably be playing the
same fucking role as Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's powering forward and trying to work
through it and not deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's working for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way men deal with shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jill is not doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's just got to feel her way through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's been brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been in a hotel room for several
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, guys, like I'm a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got dreadlocks and I'm kind of I'm
not pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put on some shorts and some shoes
and tie my dreadlocks in a fucking giant
[SPEAKER_01]: knot and we can go do whatever needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jill's a woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: She needs her woman thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: She needs clean clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She needs makeup and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't have any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that they're poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their house burned down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're staying in a fucking hotel
scraping by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if you went to dinner tonight like
you and whoever you run a Mickey D's and
[SPEAKER_02]: while you're gone, Mother Nature takes
everything you own that you didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: with you in the drive through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything but your dog and the pipe that
you took with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, Mother Nature's just been
brutal the last couple of months,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the fires in California are just the
most recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is that fucking Subcool,
Miss Jill, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tok, the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope Team TGA recovers from this and I
want to send huge love to one of my my
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers, one of the guys that inspired
me, one of the groups that taught me how
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the grower that I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't run a giant cultivation
facility if I didn't follow the weed nerd
[SPEAKER_01]: so tightly for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down to help however I can to get you
guys back on your feet if you listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see you going again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay strong, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to watch you guys get
depressed and crumble through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're badasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a whole bunch of support behind
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire cannabis community,
all the weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow Subcool, you're known as a
weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sub's a weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the leader of the weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the nerds, we've got your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also shout out to everybody out there
that's being fucking displaced and
[SPEAKER_01]: hampered and hindered and made miserable
by all these fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a terrible situation in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo Dope is about to get burned down
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know anything about Mendo Dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: These fires are headed right for the
animal triangle right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they haven't already screwed with
people, they've completely just upturned
[SPEAKER_02]: Subcool's world and that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're headed for a lot of others.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's going to be a really,
really, really awkward October,
[SPEAKER_02]: November, December this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been saying there's too much
cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this will even it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Between Mother Nature, all over the place,
the fires in Cali, the humidity and the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture, and the cold snap here,
pretty much anywhere you grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: this year, weather fuck with you hard
during your last couple of weeks of bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to fuck with the overall
outdoor harvest this year coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've also in the last like two weeks,
they've busted three pretty large illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: grows down here in southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing the same thing in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw somewhere in Oregon, they busted
like the biggest one they've ever busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's been a lot going after the
crop at the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a rough year for cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There ain't no such thing as too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never too much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the the outdoor grows they got
busted here were all ran by cartels is
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're claiming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the headline, but they just say
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody at the grow speaks Spanish,
it's a cartel grow until everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: sentenced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is the latest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're pimping with ties to Cuba.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've read 50 different news stories on
this Kabuki.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your crew?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single article is just a word for
word repeat of Pueblo County Sheriff's
[SPEAKER_02]: Office, Facebook post about the bust.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just every news agency in Colorado
from the Denver Post to the cannabis to
[SPEAKER_02]: KOAA.
[SPEAKER_02]: To KKTV, all of them copy and paste a
fucking Facebook post and call that
[SPEAKER_02]: reporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking lazy cocksucker journalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to I'm going to take a dab
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to tell them about the guy
that shot the kids in his yard for
[SPEAKER_01]: stealing cannabis last year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a dude in Denver who got
his outdoor ripped by two teenagers,
[SPEAKER_02]: opened fire while they were running away
and he's headed to jail for 80 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: 80 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he kill one of them and wounded the
other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killed one wounded one.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 years for a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't shoot people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't shoot people for your fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow more next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys plant plant a couple extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of stupid rules in
Colorado and Washington and Oregon and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit that you have to follow with
legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one I don't mind so much is keep
it the fuck locked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ripper season right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know two or three people that got ripped
and are all wrecked right now because they
[SPEAKER_02]: got ripped and they're mad and they're
hunting down people and they're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: lookout.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a fucking vehicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, dude, I fucking told you to
put it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I'm a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a cannabis grower before I should
admit being a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the shit that is keeping it
illegal in places.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the fear of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's with these valuable plants you're
putting and you're just setting TVs out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the backyard, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Motorcycles a little heavier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't get a can of spray paint and
spray paint on the front of your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got 10 grand in cash in the back,
poorly defended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're setting bags of money out there,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got gold bars on my back patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so everyone knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're putting a cannabis plant in
your backyard that creates a smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single teenager that walks by your
house from early August to late October
[SPEAKER_02]: knows you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every ripper that's driving up and down
alleyways and neighborhoods with one dude
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting in the back of the pickup and one
dude going up to the door is offering lawn
[SPEAKER_02]: service every now every couple of houses
so they don't look too shady all summer
[SPEAKER_02]: long.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a clipboard in the cab where
they're marking down addresses with
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor grows they can smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they come around in October and they
clean your shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the most predictable thing in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the main concerns everybody
had under prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were worried about rippers and cops in
that order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's like, I don't have to
worry about the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they completely forgot that they were
a secondary fucking concern 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rippers are your real problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to bring that criminal
element to your world.
[SPEAKER_02]: One dude kind of over by where I used to
live got shot to death in his front yard
[SPEAKER_02]: because the three guys he brought in from
Oklahoma to buy his crop that he couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: move here decided they'd rather shoot him
and then pay for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's part of the beauty of
legalization is we don't have to mess with
[SPEAKER_02]: any of that shit anymore, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to narrate my dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a quarter gram or so going into the
thermal banger with the Hitman sidecar rig
[SPEAKER_02]: beneath it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little too hot because Jeff doesn't
like cool dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't waste it, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Q-tip taps for rich chumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or fancy girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tangy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Platinum tangy, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like a dab of that, I will pass
this parchment your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would most definitely like a dab of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess who grew that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that us?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was us over at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our grow extracted by our friends
over at The Craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delicious dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high doesn't like destroy me,
but it tastes really, it'd be a good
[SPEAKER_01]: breakfast dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the realization that outside of this
show, I pretty much just dab at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a funny thing to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a funny thing to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dab at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike cut too high to fucking podcast
correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you forget how to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just look for the torch to fucking
heat the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an unsafe human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure you're going to be okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snort the butane?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times slash people have tried to
hit the microphone like it was the pipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Me doing it was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, of course, but I've seen it
happen a couple of few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room was full when I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coughing from my dab, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Mike, we've been going for nearly an
hour here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're heating up a dab and about
to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to ask you a question before
you hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you've got a microphone and 5,000
people listening, is there anything you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got a microphone in your face
and we start wrapping up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot us some love on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at NemoPunk15 or at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep sending us emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those make by far the best shows at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, support Mike's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I've been slacking so hard on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been inspired, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been fucking tired since we started
this new gig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go inspire Mike, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between the new job and the two-year-old,
dude, I am just wrecked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's wrecked, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send him some encouragement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even on the show anymore,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send him a power washer to wash the sand
out of his vagina.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kicking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prohibition is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited that Trump and Sessions are
talking a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming out of the woodwork a
little bit and saying a little more in
[SPEAKER_02]: public, which they didn't do for the last
eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They learned it not to, but they're coming
back in force.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching them talk at length makes me want
to debunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we like about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me a little love and that's all the
encouragement I'll need to dive all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way back into it, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Debunk Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go be Mr. Debunker.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for listening,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're taking a dab, but dude,
thanks for taking time out of your evening
[SPEAKER_01]: to come hang out and be on episode number
250.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for taking time away from the kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throw that carb cap around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get more from Elevate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that bubble cap rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a safety feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just goes in circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't roll all the way off the table,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this is where I shamelessly tell
you about my Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon, if you feel like the podcast was
worth a few bucks and you would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute, all you have to do is go to a
website called Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon will allow you as a listener to
financially contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not trying to get rich off my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do have a proposition coming up
for you in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Patreon will allow you to do is throw
down a few dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does cost me a few bucks to post to
have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I host my podcast on a website,
on the iRegenetics Colorado website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like shit and it's embarrassing,
but it does exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been touched up in quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a web guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody reached out to me and we may do
some work in the future, but that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: what the topic is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I have to pay for that website to
be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I host the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I give you the podcast for
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will happily pay for it out of my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that you'd like to help out,
send me a couple of bucks on the Patreon,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what I will use the money for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, these little microphone covers that
I'm scraping that probably sounds like
[SPEAKER_01]: shit in your headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep freshies there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like nothing, which is a real
pleasant change sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the orange one that was
here for a year?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that Wade used to use on the old
719 podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing was here for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled like homie's mustache.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I replace those and then I throw fresh
water bottles on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not free to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it if I need to, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not begging, but if you want to help
out, I'd totally appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would help us all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the 11th little box the headphone
jacks plug into, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those things break.
[SPEAKER_02]: We burn through gear here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're doing anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high-speed internet to upload the
podcast is a little pricey, but whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: 250 episodes, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not begging you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I burped as I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not begging you guys, but if you'd
like to throw down, I would truly
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, somebody just threw down $4.20 on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making a $4.20 contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to everybody who has signed up
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Mountain Dew, if anybody's
wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to caffeinated beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has got an addiction that is not a
beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded like a beer a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a product you'd like us to
review or if you'd like to sponsor the
[SPEAKER_01]: show or if you've just got something you
would like to say, you can reach out to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's GrowFromYourHeart at Hotmail.com or
you can find me on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply go to Facebook, search for the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to Twitter and you can search
for GFYH podcast or if you want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: more personal, you can find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at RastaGeoff420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, follow Mike on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Nemopunk15, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number throws me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it's number 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you want to stalk me- That was 15
when I came up with that handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where that number came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is antiquity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hair is older than some of our
listeners, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Instagram, you guys, I've got about
15,000 Instagram followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use my company name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's IriGenetics, I-R-I-E, underscore
genetics, G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: IriGenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're into cannabis photography and
you want to see what I'm growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing over at Three Rivers,
if you want to see pictures of my breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects, if you just want to see what I
think is high quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: photography, I think you would appreciate
my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier, the episodes are
going up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes me a lot of computer energy to
put those up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're going up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check out the YouTube channel if you'd
like to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely don't follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost never use that platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not good with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone, one of the listeners,
I actually, I've been feeling a little
[SPEAKER_02]: guilty about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're listening now, know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody sent me a long message on
Instagram asking about California law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it while I was on break at work and
glanced at it and was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research for a few minutes and get back to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't figure out how to bring that bitch
back up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please don't send me stuff through
there because I will lose it and then feel
[SPEAKER_02]: guilty for months on end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that person is listening tonight,
know that I've been feeling guilty
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly for months and send that question
to me on another platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost a folder of emails and there was
one in there that I was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do that on the show and I can't
find the fucking folder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did an update on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to blame it on that, but I don't
know where it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I screenshotted it or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, I don't know, but I told everybody,
I was like, hey, if you guys, if you sent
[SPEAKER_01]: me a really cool email and you feel like I
haven't read it yet or a message and I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't responded, fucking send it again,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Annoy me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only work if you keep on me,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so much shit going on that the open
mouth gets fed, I guess is the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're quiet and you don't remind
me, I might skip you and it's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I'm doing 10,000 things and I
can't think four thoughts at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Emails don't do much when they don't get
answered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants do a lot when they don't get
watered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, I didn't mean it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how our lives go, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing that game for three days
at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 25 things I want to do and need to
do and would like to do, but I have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the eight things that I have to do first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being the grow manager, it feels like
I'll be like, all right, I got to do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this guy working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trim crew is kicking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put on some gloves,
throw an earbud in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to run in here and start
doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to mix up the water so that I
could do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I start filling the water
container, the doorbell rings and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I'm going to ignore it and let
somebody up front answer it and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, you motherfuckers always walk
somebody right to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jeff, these guys need you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, fuck, I was going to get
worked on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a day that that was happened to
me real bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some reason, everyone that rang
the doorbell, it wasn't ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd get up on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,
ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,
[SPEAKER_02]: ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,
ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,
[SPEAKER_02]: ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember that day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was screaming every time the
doorbell rang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have learned that we have a
grow and we'd like to play our music kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of fucking loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some people, yeah, I know that guy
didn't, but sometimes we've missed people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in there and they're like,
yeah, I sat here and listened to your
[SPEAKER_01]: music for like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, fuck, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did you like that reggae playlist?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's Morgan heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like those harmonies?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a family that's been singing
together for a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crazy busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we've missed you in any way,
just send that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holler, especially that person who sent me
a message on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it seemed like a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like you cared a lot about
getting the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just only got a chance to glance at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only vaguely know what it was about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it disappeared into an app.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a similar message from somebody
asking me about Texas laws and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about Texas law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought I should research that,
but I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my Instagram messages sucks unless you
live in Austin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listener who asked about Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Texas is one of the places that,
um, cops have been busted doing body
[SPEAKER_02]: cavity searches on the side of the fucking
road because the cop is pretty sure he
[SPEAKER_02]: smells weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're also the place where if you
make edibles with a concentrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: say like you put a gram of shatter into a
tray of brownies, they put that whole tray
[SPEAKER_02]: of brownies on the scale, fucking Pyrex
dish included and say you've got 30 pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of concentrate, which they classify along
the same lines as heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because you made hash brownies with
actual hash, you get rung up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you had six kilos of heroin coming
over the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't mess with Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Texas is not the place to cannabis right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, their laws are pretty brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there are a lot of cannabis refuges.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Texas and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there sure are.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Mike, I'm coughing from a dad,
but I think it's time to wrap up this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we, we didn't mean to do it,
but we say we throw a little informative
[SPEAKER_02]: nugget in right at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it to them and we ended up doing it
on fucking random Texas law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how stone works.
[SPEAKER_01]: 250 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, when I started the podcast,
I was like, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started, I was like, maybe I can do
a hundred shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I done nearly in a hundred episodes of
another podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, that wasn't that
hard, but he did all the talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the producer and cohost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to chime in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I would sit here and,
uh, wait for him to say some dumb shit so
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can just seeing him the best I
could was what I did on that podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a lot of practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I can do a hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to a hundred and I was like,
that doesn't even feel like I'm started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like I have a rhythm now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, on episode 100, I don't remember
if it was while we were recording or right
[SPEAKER_02]: before or after someone was like,
I can't believe you did a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were like, yeah, we will do this
again for 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all kind of looked around the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, do you really think you're
going to do this in a hundred times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I knew that there was that kind of
look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, man, he's really on a roll
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these shows are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're rambling and talking, but man,
it's a lot of work to put out this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we just got to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has those days at work where
you're just like, I'm going to put my
[SPEAKER_01]: thumb in my butt and put my phone all day
at work and hide in the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has those days occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you don't have too many,
but I mean, we did that on this show a few
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that I'm at 250, once I got to
like a hundred, I was like, I'll do 250.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got that weird OCD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, dude, the goal is 500 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rogan did a thousand recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's at like a thousand and 20 or
something by now, but he does three a week
[SPEAKER_01]: and eats fucking a bunch of alpha brain
and drinks coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that man talks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a good body mic to take bow
hunting with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a thousand episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll work on a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be here for, you'll be even,
you're getting gray up there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be super gray by a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're noticing because I always have a
hat on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been going gray for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of salt and my pepper now
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to wrap up the podcast
with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been 250 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to put out a Thursday
episode as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three episodes this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to spoil the people and got to
give them what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now it sounds like I promised it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we got to Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday shows are easy to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there's a prize for the person
who I can identify who can identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I sounded just like that just now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds just like that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I identify that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also there's a voice when the record spins
backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a voice in there that goes
backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can identify whose voice that
is, you get a prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could tell me what they said,
you get an even better prize, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: where you are, who you are, how much you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Chung, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like a leavening cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, I'm going to submit those
answers officially folks.

[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, cucumber boat motherfucking wire.

about, you're down as fuck.
