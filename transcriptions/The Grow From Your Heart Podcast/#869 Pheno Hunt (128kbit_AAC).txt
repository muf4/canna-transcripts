[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, there is a strain
description and a strain report on almost
[SPEAKER_00]: every strain available from IRI genetics
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in alphabetical order.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're separated by regular and
feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on those strains and you can
see grow reports from the grow community
[SPEAKER_00]: from the IRI army.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow details.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can interact with people that have
grown those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want full grow reports,
full grow details, join us on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those reports are on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also a lot of grow guides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are SOPs on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone care SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The STS and reversal SOP is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great things on the Discord

of energy in the room lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cordially invite you to come hang out
with us on the Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a link in the show notes and
the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is a link on my website,
IRIgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I feel like I've been rambling for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work our way here into the question
and answer portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say we're going to talk about
selecting a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question that came from my
website, IRIgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from my new friend,
Alexander K.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, when you are pheno
hunting, what parameters do you personally
[SPEAKER_00]: search for in flowers and hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, we're going to focus
on selecting a phenotype for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mainly grow personally for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working my way towards growing things
for concentrates, but I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love to smoke the concentrates,
but I grow mostly for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do grow the flower, the flower gets
smoked as flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of other great
concentrate makers out there doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stick to the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, we're going to talk
about selecting a phenotype for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do I mean about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by selecting a phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people might not even know what
that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we buy a pack of seeds, whether they
are regular or feminized or even auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower seeds, when you make seeds,
depending on the filial generation of how
[SPEAKER_00]: far down those seeds have been bred,
when seeds are created, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: express different phenotypes when they are
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I take, we're going to say Golden
Goat and Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cross those two plants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes my famous strain called Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow the Arise F1s, that first
filial generation, not all of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that come from those seeds will look
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to look more like Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to look more like Arise or
more like Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to look just like both
parents perfectly combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to be weird mutants,
weird different weirdos, different
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions of the genes, however they
collided within that breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about families that you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about brothers and sisters that you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the same parents, but the
brother and the sister, they'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: similar characteristics and also very
different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of them's got, so we'll say
dad's got blue eyes, mom's got brown eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe one of the offspring maybe both of
the offspring have brown eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means dad's got a dominant gene that
he's passing down that brown-eyed gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they both have different color eyes,
then nobody's carrying a dominant eye
[SPEAKER_00]: color gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just depends on how the genes
collide when the breeding happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all came out of the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody check me on my fucking breeding
chart right there with mom and dad and my
[SPEAKER_00]: gene passing theory there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Argue about it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate me please.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I said something, because I said it
really quickly, I'm second guessing
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a phenotype is just the different
expressions of those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it's based on, it could be based on
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this could be based on how the
plants are fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the expression of a plant in a
certain environment, the expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: that genotype in a specific environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to run, we'll say that you
got 10, we'll just go with feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say you got a six pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see some differences in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we grow those plants, we're going to
see maybe very drastic differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe very minute differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you won't see a lot of visual
difference, but when you smoke them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might notice a lot of aromatic or
flavor or effect differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a phenotype, a phenotype is the
different variation that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst the population in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't Google that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pulling that definition out of
what I understand as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a phenotype is to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different, when we grow plants,
we see different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can change if you, so if we take the
same clone and grow in a different room,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother thing to fucking
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you find or how do I find when
I'm hunting, what parameters do I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally search for when finding a
phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to touch on is when I
started putting strains out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet and talking about strains that
I've bred, I highlight specific phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have found amongst these seed packs
or amongst these breeding projects or
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst the progeny of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to use big words at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have given some of these phenotypes,
like people know about the meat,
[SPEAKER_00]: mean girl phenotype, and people know
they're just certain phenotypes that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from certain plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been given names and labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the painted lady cut of the
afterglow, which has gotten famous at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the painted lady cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its own name because it came from
the painted lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those cuts have their, they get their
own names.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I saw the downside to that is now
sometimes you guys will run a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and you'll be looking for the
phenotype that I liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why you want the one that I
liked, but I'm not gonna smoke the pack
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find the phenotype that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admire the fact that you guys want to
find the phenotype that I'm smoking and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to find that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about the one that grows best for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I like to describe it is you
agreed when you bought the pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say that Arise, I'm just making shit
up as we go here, is Italian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say, you went through the website,
you're like, I'm not sure what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You settled on a certain pack of seeds for
a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, it's got this,
it's got this, and it does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that the thing you want is in
that pack of seeds, that you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: allure already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking, you've got a taste,
you've got an idea of what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find the phenotype that your
brain makes you think you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I describe it is that Arise is
Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're scrolling around, you're like,
what restaurant do I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, Italian food sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've settled on Italian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the phenotype is which dish at that
Italian restaurant do I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's mostly all going to be red
sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be noodles, or maybe you
want the white sauce and the gnocchi,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's all going to be Italian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have that Italian flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bought a pack of Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just your turn to pick off the
menu, the favorite Italian food that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do that, don't listen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to choose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want me to choose your meal for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly vegetarian most of the time,
and I like garlic shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like kind of spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some capers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might not be for you at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be a full red sauce and meatballs
kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't judge you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't order my food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't order yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm saying is don't pick the
phenotype that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick the phenotype that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do that is to grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend to grow them all in
the same conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell what's standing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell who's better if you didn't
give everybody the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you gave this one plant recharge,
you gave this one grow dots, you gave this
[SPEAKER_00]: one green sensation, of course you're
going to see different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them all the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow your plants until you can get a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take two or three clones off of every
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give them numbers or letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant one, plant two, plant three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard, especially if you're
just running small numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A six pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take clones, give the clones the
corresponding number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone one goes with plant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone number two came off of plant number
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then now we've got clones for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case we do find something
phenomenal and we want to run that again,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got keepers in the clone dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're over there waiting for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pot those later when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you run the pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get clones from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some notes as they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where you're going to have two
different opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grower, there's going to be one
phenotype that bangs out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to put out all the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be another one that
smells super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are never the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The super good smell or the frosty and the
big weight, two different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get all three of those traits
broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two of those traits and two
different phenomes, but it's hard to get
[SPEAKER_00]: all three.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you find all three, that's a ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So run the pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch them as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the grower, take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one was the easiest or most
pleasurable to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one was the most pain in the ass to
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be one that's harder than
everybody else to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to be harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were those your favorite or least favorite
plants to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or also, did you get spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one handle that better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one give you more weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one taste better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one give you more trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one have just a crazy good fucking
smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was one indestructible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you beat the shit out of the plants
and this one just shined through like a
[SPEAKER_00]: warrior?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants as the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them to your best possible ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim them to the best of your ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then have them all in separate jars the
entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant one through six all in separate
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the buds all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when we smoke them, we can take a
bong rip or smoke a bowl or smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: or vape it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're boofing it, whatever you're up
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But take sample number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with the fresh clear head.
[SPEAKER_00]: First smoke of the day and take a smoke or
a boof of sample number one and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit there for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that taste real good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste like what I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste like something I do not
want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe does this taste like something I
can sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be what you got to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then enjoy number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes if you're that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down your notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to let, here's the hard part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to let your bias as a grower come
into play as the smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may already be thinking number two was
the easiest to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put out all those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want number two to be the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate the grower from the smoker you
and let's just smoke them very
[SPEAKER_00]: discerningly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next day wake up fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you start smoking, smoke sample
number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it what I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it not what I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things that you can think
about when it comes to selecting your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, first you're gonna see visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it visually appealing to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it bright green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dark green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it black?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed is crazy colors now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fucking purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it visually appealing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does it smell good, does it smell
like the flavor I was hoping to get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste the way that I was hoping to
get out of this package of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly the same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the buzz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this what I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you an indica guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this indica weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a daytime smoker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this gonna be good for a daytime smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a medical requirement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this meet that requirement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this reach your clients, your
clientele's demands?
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that as you're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work your way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sample one through six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try some with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a couple of good friends,
like I've got Mike that would come over if
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Mike, we got to do a pheno
hunt smoke selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's fucking, by the time I hung up the
phone, the door would open.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, come here buddy,
let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody wants to come help you out
with a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first jar to get empty in your pheno
hunt is probably the plant that you should
[SPEAKER_00]: keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the one you should smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one to go empty is the one you
liked the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't go for your least favorite
fucking candy every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go for the first favorite candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a color of whatever,
you got some candies in front of you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got chocolate, strawberry,
vanilla, whichever one your favorite is,
[SPEAKER_00]: disappearing first, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna take that chocolate one every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are gonna be left with
strawberry and vanilla and be sad,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's how you know which one is the
best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That jar that runs out of weed first,
grow more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the phenotype that you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even looking at the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow the pack, run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all the same shit to every single one
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a clone from them so that,
oh yeah, we've got that clone that we took
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, maybe two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do like a tiered system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a bracket match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with six, narrow it down to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your favorite two phenotypes,
and if you're allowed to grow six plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut three of each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're allowed to grow, you see the
point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill half the room with one, half the room
with the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run them exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Round two, fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see who comes out better this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those phenotypes is gonna stand
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you only got two to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now which jar empties more quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's see how that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So narrow it down like a cage match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with six, then run your favorite
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got those clones back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was fucking talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the clones from your favorite two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can run that forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a mother plant if you took
successful clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let those clones go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take clones, keep cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preservation all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always do your bracket cage match system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So run the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run them all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to let the grower in you be the
judge and let the smoker be the judge,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's really what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the money is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's gonna see what happens in the
grow except you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one plant yielded you two pounds and
one yielded one pound, I get why that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it fucking smokes the best,
you still may have to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration with that if you're a
cashcropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But weigh your pros and cons and see what
you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your parameters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've talked about, I told you how to
check yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna kind of tell you how I do mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most important to me, and I've kind of
hinted at this, the most important is buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: and effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not smoking just to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not growing just to post the shit to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking this shit, growing it to smoke
it to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take seven dabs and come to a podcast
and don't stutter seven times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most important thing to me is,
of course, the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else matters?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna fucking smoke this to get
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the buzz, does it have a good buzz,
a strong buzz, a long-lasting buzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the type of buzz that I intend to
enjoy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of different buzzes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a nice head-wringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that makes me fucking,
like when you're doing a podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you think you saw shit moving over there,
but there's nothing over there but a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes, bro, shit's moving over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know you're smoking good
shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you go to Target and you got a
shopping cart filled with stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: something in your head goes, hey,
man, we got to leave, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, but we're just shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your heart goes, I'm racing,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have to leave Target.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fucking smoke I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's got that kind of buzz for me,
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't want that kind of buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people smoke that buzz and just grab
their head and be like, bro, I got to go
[SPEAKER_00]: lay down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it have the buzz I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that buzz have legs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it last a little while for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed some stuff, I could smoke it,
and I get fucking wrecked for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that was really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke more weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just not even high anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weed has no legs is what we call
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next category that I think I check on,
and this is as a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about as a grower, I guess,
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next most important thing is flavor
and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it doesn't taste and smell good,
what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much good shit out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why have something that doesn't taste
fucking delicious?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to burn right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the smoke ability, the flavor,
the aroma, and overall smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I enjoy the smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste good?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weed will leave a funk on your lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will make your tongue fucking dry and
crusty, which sometimes I'll enjoy if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO will leave that just coating on
your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going, and everybody knows you
got truck mouth, and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck, my shit is dry, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But smoke ability, does it burn good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time that's a dry and cure
issue, but some of it you just don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it even fucking smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't burn well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dry and cure issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But flavor and aroma are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next category is there, then obviously
visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visuals are a lot of it, even if the
visuals don't have anything to do with how
[SPEAKER_00]: it tastes or how I get high from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like looking at beautiful,
photogenic quality, well done weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first category, buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to get me fucking lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second category, flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's got to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third category, it's got to look pretty
for the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about growth
characteristics, and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of this fine show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth characteristics that I do look for
in a phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic shape and structure and frame of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it hold itself up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to, is it a wispy piece of
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it toppling over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it support itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it big enough, strong enough branches
to hold gigantic buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next thing I think about is leaf
size and shape, because that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate a lot of the buzz to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that tells me long, skinny leaves,
probably fucking crazy sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give me that fucking sort of buzz
that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also going to take a while to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got those big fat indica leaves
that you could camp under and build a
[SPEAKER_00]: shack with, it's not going to take as long
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give me a nice chilled out,
sedative buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good hint of what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then bud type and density.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that bud grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it just grows wispy and shitty,
I might not want to fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a nice looking bud, is it rocky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fluffy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cone shaped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it got a bunch of rocks, a bunch of
blockhead at the top?
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay attention to that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to think about tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it handle problems like heat,
cool, overfeed, underfeed, forgot to feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much humidity, drought, all of the
above?
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're going to do to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the things you've fucked up and
forgotten or accidentally did to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these going to react?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to know, because
sometimes I'm going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a really good experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the equipment fucks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants going to handle it if
there's a small, medium problem in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tolerance is what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these plants prone to getting insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some strains that just fucking
love bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream is such a shitty strain that
spider mites don't even like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just joking around, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of hate for Blue Dream in
the commercial industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites don't even like Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some cultivars that spider mites
won't go toward, and there are some that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could put three cultivars in a room
and the mites go, that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just head right for that motherfucker
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it resistant to spider mites,
thrips, fungus gnats, powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: bud rot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the right type of ... Maybe perhaps
you're going to be growing outdoors in a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the right kind of phenotype for your
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends on the coast, up in the
North Coast, the East and the West,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have something that can handle a
lot of fog, a lot of moisture and finish
[SPEAKER_00]: before I get fucking too wet outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a phenotype that you guys could
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that I would pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth, the shape, the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same things I look for when breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a pain in the ass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle my room, my program,
my feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also going to be a big factor,
because I'm not going to change the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: room for one fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to fit in, fit in or get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure that I have covered all
of my notes here, because I got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, pick the ... Grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick the phenotype that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the advice that I give you about
phenotype, the bottom line is,
[SPEAKER_00]: pick the one that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one you love to grow and the one you
love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line, probably ... I must have
watched some Stone Cold shit, because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the bottom line and Stone Cold said
so, but fucking the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: the empty jar is the one that people like
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that's going to sell the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably get smoked up and
consumed the quickest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've covered more than enough on
how to select a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure how long I rambled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a full length episode with all the
chattery shit going on in my head today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
pheno hunters, all of you beautiful
