[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm recording ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in anticipation, I'm sure it was a
great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the real world, I may have mentioned
this in a previous episode, I did ask our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Pedro to record a video about
cleaning our rig and our banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully in the near future here,
when Pedro has some time this weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are ready to go, we'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already happened when this video
comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how weird production time can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedro will make a video to teach us how to
clean our glass, how to keep our rigs,
[SPEAKER_00]: our banger clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's given me some great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just told him, make a video for me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show this to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will get that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get that out to you as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also look forward to feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of FEM seeds out there and
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new stuff being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also making restocks of a lot of the
things that are in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Jeffery will be restocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat will be restocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Gasm will be restocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red and blue pills will be officially
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is more stuff in the room to be
pollinated that I will not mention at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reversal is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The project is underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reversed plant is showing me that it
is reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is showing that it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are male parts or pollen parts
popping up on this female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have dragged the female plants into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen receivers are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am debating if they will get their final
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten sprayed up to day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they're going to get
sprayed on day 24 or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a game time decision to be made
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe hit one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hit the other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we'll think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Document mark down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good notes of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the FEM project is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that there will be feminized
seeds in a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants do need to get mature enough to
accept the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen donors need to make the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be a little bit of action
happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, we've got six to eight
weeks for seeds to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got harvest time, dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you heard that grossness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have dry and cure time, packaging
time, all that good stuff to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask me about the Lemon,
Jeffrey, Golden Goat, Orange Gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and FEMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on the show ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that listen ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is more stuff to be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to say it here on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the best platforms to
release stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made Afterglow feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the Afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Clementine female pollinated by
the Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Clementine to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clementine to King Solomon made Afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mike for coining the name
Afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that in a conversation one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you shut up with that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use that as a strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became the Afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a bunch of Afterglow seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow, magically, I got a bunch of those
seeds to our friend, the Painted Lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Painted Lady grew the shit out of the
Afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She found a keeper in there that was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow, magically, I acquired that keeper
from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that keeper of the Afterglow and I
reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made Afterglow S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also out-crossed it to a bunch of
magical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those will be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have already been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are out there as testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are just getting sent out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afterglow will be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: The out-crosses are being tested now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great Femmes coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys that are asking, guys and gals
that are asking for Feminize seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have a nice menu very,
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a good message right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one may be more of a compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend,
Ask Hickerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my buddy, Ask Hickerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep kicking ass, Kickerson arse out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to do it, you keep doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you can use my name, but I don't
need this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to be on the podcast
because I want to read one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: compliments that's in here just because a
lot of people think I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this does kind of back up one of my
statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, first and foremost, I have to say
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vinnie mentions where he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I'm working my way back
through the catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reverse order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm around 520 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is I've heard you mention
switching to 18 six at the end of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: for a week or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in one episode, I do mention turning
your timer back to 18 and six during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you begin flushing your plants,
uh, turn your light timer to 18 hours on
[SPEAKER_00]: and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a lot of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk a lot of trash to me
for this method, but all of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that talk shit about this method,
about this advice, refuse to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't talk shit until you try
something, at least put one or two plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and prove me wrong before you
talk shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it and it works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just talking and you haven't
done it, that, that is not really,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, don't even bother messaging me with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, our friend here says, uh,
I have grown out the same cut four times
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've never had the buds swell at the
end like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this mic wasn't on a stand,
I would fucking drop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be never had the bud swell
like this mic drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be over right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd hear the thud and then some dope ass
music would play and I would walk off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a supporter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend backs up my statement that
changing the timer to 18 hours on and six
[SPEAKER_00]: hours off for the last 10 to 14 days of
flower will bulk up and increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy says I have never had buds
swell at the end like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting rambly here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but these days, while I do grow for
head stash and a couple of the homies,
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have two cancer patients in my life
that I grow for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, uh, big up congratulations and thank
you, uh, for putting in the effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, the energy, the compassion,
the dedication to grow for other people,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for ourselves, growing for money,
growing for profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing a product you're putting in time,
energy, effort, electricity, money,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're dedicating your space,
your plant count, uh, your numbers to
[SPEAKER_00]: another person, to two other sick people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's commendable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's respectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up shout out for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you could have gotten stingy and use
that space for profit, that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: As profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it to give that product to a
sick person because they have cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is growing from your heart,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I seem distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm expecting a delivery and they will not
leave it if I don't sign for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say, uh, I also have two cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to help them just a little bit
more brings tears to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, as soon as I noticed it working,
I promptly joined the Patreon and ordered
[SPEAKER_00]: some I read genetics, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can support the statement of,
um, knowing what it's like to grow for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky enough, fortunate enough,
blessed enough to be involved in the very
[SPEAKER_00]: first dispensary here in this city.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some folks that had the right
idea, but they didn't have the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they had the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just needed some pushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of younger, hipper, had more
energy, more experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been to more dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the funding and the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know how to really set up a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of handed me the keys and let me
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the privilege to meet, uh,
every medical marijuana patient in my
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like some of them were,
uh, 70 year old old ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to call you old ladies,
but that describes what they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, lovely gracious 70 year old senior
ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the more polite way to say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there were also 70 year old veterans,
70 year old firefighters, uh, 70 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: ex gangsters, 70 year old city council
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: What city council members came?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not supposed to say that, but they may
have popped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know who they are or which one
they was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there were a lot of people popped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I got 35 year old construction
workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got uh, people that I think may have
been a cop sometimes came and bought
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legally with a medical marijuana
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 21 year old dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would jog up and buy weed and jog right
on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see the entire community,
every type of condition you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see that come into my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to interact with them and talk with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to develop actual relationships with
a lot of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the older people that slow down and
take their time and talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not in a rush to get out and
get back on Twitter and Instagram or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new fucking thing we're scrolling on,
uh, get in the car and play the new track
[SPEAKER_00]: and drive fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older people, we really had time to
connect and they would tell me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I smoked this one and it didn't
help much, but I smoked this one and I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes people would come with their
significant other older people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: sick would come with their wife or their
husband or their caretaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would say, you know, since you
gave us this strain, since you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking this lemon, Jeffrey, uh,
my dad, my husband, my wife has been a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better of a person, a lot easier to get
along with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would see medicine that we would
grow and recommend improve the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost said, that's what it was all
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's what it is all about when it
comes to recreational and medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is improving the quality of people's
lives, whether it's a healthy person like
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, who's got some bodily pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke to relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people that are just
smoking because they've got some other
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, whatever we're smoking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people have cancer, AIDS, cachexia,
a lot of other crazy shit, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking for, as long as it improves the
quality of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up for taking energy, time,
uh, effort out of your day and having
[SPEAKER_00]: some, some compassion to take care of
these other people, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to see exactly what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would come in and the first visit
they would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, intimidated, scared, confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't know what they were talking
about, what they were buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would know they feel like shit and
they're down to try medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that will help by the fifth or sixth
time they came in to see me, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: high five me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would skip in be like, what's up Ross
to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get an eighth of the lemon,
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an eighth of this OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll see you in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do fucking cartwheels and skip
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, that's a completely
different person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that came in here before
seemed, uh, almost defeated, almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: their, their illness, their ailment was
winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we've got them on cannabis,
their body is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their spirit is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationships are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see that firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you said you were rambling,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about a ramble fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, uh, I love thinking and talking
about those old days of when the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: market started, uh, developing because I
really do enjoy, did enjoy developing
[SPEAKER_00]: those relationships with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm recommending seeds and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when people ask me about cannabis and
get me going about this, I really do like
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I walked into somewhere the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been on the road for like three hours
and I walked in and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't get my bag set down and my
shoes kicked off before somebody was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're the weed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, it didn't even phase me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just clicked into like from traffic
mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in fuck this traffic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever been in traffic where you just
want to throw bricks at the cars just
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, why do you have wheels and
doors?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I felt about the traffic that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I got into the place,
somebody was like, you're the weed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have weed questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's questions one through seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't flinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't hesitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kindly kicked off my shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set my bag down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat down and looked them in the face and
I explained everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking knew about their questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind of new at cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely had the answers and I just
could not shut up about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, bro, thank you for the great
reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend at ours Kickerson, thank you for
the reminder of how much I enjoy the
[SPEAKER_00]: connection of recommending strains and
then seeing a person I would give you two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three strains and give them to you on a
discount price and send you home and let
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes back in the day, bro,
we could smoke those strains in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and see what you liked,
but then you'd come back and have reports
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we'd improve the quality of your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, thank you for reminding me that,
uh, sometimes it did bring tears to my
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes to see the improvements that we could
give to people's quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also bro, thank you for
supporting the fact that 18 six at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you haven't seen that
episode, I will link it to this show at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does give me the opportunity to put the
subscribe and then the next video up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to put the correct video
right up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which side it will go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't figured that out yet because it
reverses and then what the hell's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, but I'll put the 18 six on the
screen at the end of the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could just click that also make
sure you subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another email here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to it because I am talking
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've been smoking a whole bunch of
lemon Jeffrey live rosin out of a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the past couple of days have been a
little fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a new rig and got a bunch of
lemon Jeffrey concentrates on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I'm a spoiled brat, but since
then, uh, I feel like I'm not sure if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: time traveling or if I'm frozen in time or
somewhere in between, but time isn't doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what it normally to my clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't spinning like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more kind of like it's moving up and
down in the spin motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a not consistent in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, hi, my name is Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Fred?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for contributing with the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am planning on working with a
variety of cultivars soon, including
[SPEAKER_00]: scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that works well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question, which insects would
you make sure were present before
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning an outdoor plot or soon
thereafter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand more research will be
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the keys I'm going to get
to is research will be necessary is I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never worked with organic methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, is there a handful or a list of
insect species that you or other
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial growers prefer to ensure a
healthier garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps I could foster a healthier yard in
general, as some of these species are
[SPEAKER_00]: already present in this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says I've got wasps and ladybugs and
the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is you've seen the wasps and you
have seen the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already watching for wasps,
which is what you should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the ladybugs are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically harmless, but you can't
see most of the harmful insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the bugs that are really going to
cause you problems are microscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the spider mites, the, uh,
I don't even want to say the russet mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the fungus gnats, the thrips,
uh, the, what are the things you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to run into mites, thrips, aphids,
aphids are very common outside in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get caterpillars, the caterpillars
leave these little orange, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: melon, their melon caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave a melon worm in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat the inside of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure what those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but we get a lot of those kinds of
bugs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are bugs that I would prepare to
battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't tell me where you are,
but then it says also as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: which host plants are your go-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the podcast and cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big disclaimer before I even delve too
deeply into this, I am not an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow indoors with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of my pesticide prevention is
honestly straight up sprayed pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: applications until I move into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we do play with the,
uh, the pest, uh, the predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I don't do this outdoors and I
don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first things I'm going to
recommend is find an insectiary near you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there is a, an insectiary near you
that distributes bugs to greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: farms for this purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they're going to offer you
the small order that you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can get the information that you
need from them and then find a retail
[SPEAKER_00]: provider from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make other recommendations,
uh, but call an insectiary near you or
[SPEAKER_00]: call other farmers near you, or perhaps
get on the internet and do some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: What pests are coming to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already mentioned we're going to get
mites, thrips, aphids, caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's a specific bug
that comes where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every region is going to have an extra
attacker that the farmers there know
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know about the caterpillars here because
I hear people bitch about it every year
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do some research and be prepared for
what bugs are going to come your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, uh, we also get,
what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't think of what fucking
grasshoppers were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of grasshoppers here in
Pueblo mid summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll just be a gang of grasshoppers
appear out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we also get deer in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get bear in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the city, but a few miles that
way you'll see bear and they'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeding it organics,
it smells real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bears really want to know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you used a fish product and you,
you live by the river and you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, expect a bear to come up to that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very likely, very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we get deer, bear, rabbits,
grasshoppers, uh, then all kinds of small,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, rodents and ground dwelling animals,
just low, fucking low, small stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: skunks and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll eat your weed plants, uh,
cats, cats will eat the fucking weed
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen plenty of cats and weed grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first piece of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second piece of advice is to see what
bugs, what pest, what problems may be
[SPEAKER_00]: present, who may show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can Google that probably through
the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a growers group in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's legal or illegal and
I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So half of my recommendations are going to
be vague, but find what bugs are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what problems are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anticipate that then also do some research
with that insectiary, other grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: forums, websites to find out what bugs out
predator bugs will do well in your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could release all of the predator bugs
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could spend a million bucks,
but doorbell, I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doorbell did ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expecting a delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can focus more on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the package I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, may show you that in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was I saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you can order a million dollars
worth of predator insects to try to guard
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden, your outdoor plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they are not the appropriate
insects for your environment, they may
[SPEAKER_00]: die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may just crawl away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not even stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may get eaten by other bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they may battle each other if you get
the wrong combination of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do a little bit of research on
what predator bugs will work well in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds crazy, but an
insectiary would give you good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say, Hey, these bugs work well
in your heat, your humidity, in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, because if you buy,
uh, I'm just going to give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you spend a thousand dollars on
hypoaspis miles and you put those out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know the range that the hypos
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they do like my indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I buy for the indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you put the hypoaspis miles out
there and it's too hot or too cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll either die or they'll leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just simply fucking crawl away and
go find a more desirable environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't like what's going on,
they're going to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to get the bugs that are
appropriate for your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A website that will help you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course is Arbeco organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a R B I C O dash organics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot give them any positive or
negative endorsements on their products
[SPEAKER_00]: nor their customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen plenty of positive reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also seen plenty of negative
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right in the middle with the reviews
I've read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would do my own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you order bugs, there's got to be a
closer insectiary to you to order the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: from the advantage of Arbeco is they'll
sell you very small batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other places don't sell small
batches of bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbeco will deliver a small batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: To you again, um, I can't support or say
they're good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they do offer the products we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know their catalog is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know their website is awesome,
but I've seen people say that they get
[SPEAKER_00]: dead bugs from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen people say that they get
amazing bugs from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be your decision to make
their, although their website and their
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines and catalogs are awesome for
research, for information, for educational
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't purchase from them,
you can use their website to get you a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of information, get you a lot of
education, get yourself a nice foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: and background.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read a lot from their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's Arbeco, A R B I C O dash
organics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe to the best of my recollection,
did not write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, one thing that I read is they
don't, they don't breed any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy their bugs from an insectiary and
then mail them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like a third party.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like the Amazon of bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may be easier if you can find a local
insectiary near you to get the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to do it and use Arbeco for
your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you can't find a supplier,
that website is always there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be really diplomatic about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read good and bad reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I don't know which way I sway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if it's my only option, I may risk it,
uh, risk a few bucks to save the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I do some research then,
uh, once you've established which bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: will live in your area and which bugs are
going to battle your area, order the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like to set up the subscription
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Order them to, you can schedule them to
come on specific intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I run a commercial grow, I usually
have them show up either every week or
[SPEAKER_00]: every two weeks, depending on,
uh, the threat that is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see bugs, we double up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't see bugs, we go once a week
with the sachets and with the releasing of
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give you a quick list of the
predators that I did write down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I wrote down all of them
because I just thought of kookamaris and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the kookamaris, the californicus,
some of these, they changed their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may repeat things because they've got
double names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the californicus, the kookamaris,
the swarski, hypoaspis miles, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: lace wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those will work in a lot of
environments and they are very aggressive
[SPEAKER_00]: predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs are lazy in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is my honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy a lot of ladybugs and they're
not going to do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ladybug larvae will eat a lot,
but, uh, the green lacewing in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: will eat three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the science behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but from what I've seen,
when I use ladybugs, they end up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: whites and the ducting on the floor,
uh, just over there humping each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them fucking all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make really cool pictures,
but they don't eat the fucking bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I release green lacewing eggs,
I don't see any more bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any, any lace wings anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not over there chilling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being fucking warriors and they're
eating all of the bugs I want them to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really, really fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn, start off as little crocodiles
and they start getting little wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they just go through this weird
metamorphosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those are the lace wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am not a bug expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an outdoor growing expert,
but I do recommend that you research the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs that will be coming to your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's going to be spider mites,
thrips, aphids, caterpillars, fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whatever bugs come in your area,
I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, it's hard for me to anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to find what's coming to
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about, uh, kookamaris,
californis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it californicus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you'll figure it out when you search
predator bowl, uh, Arbico organics will
[SPEAKER_00]: have it all right there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even need to repeat this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to Arbico, you're going to
see more than what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, rove beetles are fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what are the assassin beetles?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot that you can release,
but if they're not right for your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you took me to a fish concert,
I'm sticking around all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take me to, I'm trying,
I would stay to most concerts because I
[SPEAKER_00]: like music.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took me to see, uh, sorry,
if you took me to a Keith urban concert,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not into the country music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to just leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that somebody who is a Keith urban fan
can have the ticket and enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to go on with this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as for host plants, dude, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my straight up answer for host
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to contact my buddy,
Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has any
recommendations for host plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can plant outdoors to help mitigate
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send your info to grow from your heart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read that on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure you follow the bug lady,
Susan Wainwright Evans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Suzanne or Susan, Suzanne Wainwright
Evans?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the bug lady on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, she is a pest expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a pesticide expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trained by the Colorado department of
agriculture, uh, the Colorado state
[SPEAKER_00]: university, also trained by, uh,
the Colorado department of public health
[SPEAKER_00]: and environment and pesticide application,
uh, pesticide handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trained the trainer certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do know quite a bit about pesticides
and pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what you're asking is very
regionally specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would focus in on your region,
on the pest attacking your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pests, the prevention that would work
in your area, and then go a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I put you off on the right foot,
got you onto the right start, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, leaned you toward the right website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope I got you going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, pollen,
chukkers, organic growers, salt spillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank each and every one of you
