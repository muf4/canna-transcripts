[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 371 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to tell by my voice that
I've got a nasty little head cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my website is broken, so I'm unable
to post the podcast to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to do a long drawn out
grow lesson or an intense podcast episode
[SPEAKER_00]: for Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to drop in and say hello and
maybe mention a few things that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: thankful or grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to be reminded and remind
others of things that we're grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am grateful that you folks have been
listening to the podcast almost
[SPEAKER_00]: religiously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly appreciate all of the listens,
all of the clicks, all of the downloads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more than all of the listens,
I appreciate all of the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of the emails,
all of the Instagram messages,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the Twitter messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me and thanks
for trusting me with your garden and with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis advice that I give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really grateful that this little
podcast has developed into a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got a family based around this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have developed the iry army is what
some of the folks have labeled this little
[SPEAKER_00]: group that follows the podcast so closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a big thank you and a
giant fist bump to the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thankful for each and every one of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be an army without each one of
you fill in your position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I am very grateful for is
the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been very generous on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly notice that and I appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind folks at Best Buy certainly
notice and appreciate your Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have covered the cost of the
MacBook that runs this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have kept the podcast alive by
contributing and I certainly do notice it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not contributing on Patreon,
don't feel left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still appreciate you just for listening,
just for being a part of the podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: just for trying to be a part of moving
cannabis forward with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make cannabis more accepted by
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to grow better cannabis and
I want people to have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding and a better attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: toward cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just by listening and opening your
mind, you are participating in the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank each and every one of you for all
the podcast support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some stuff that's not
podcast related.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am grateful that I am in generally good
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I sound like shit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little cold big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a lot of vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the medicine kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My palms are getting super sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this cold will be knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, I am in good general
health mentally and physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm doing fairly well business
wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is part of my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed sales are taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like iRegenetics is going really
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have spread our wings quite far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a far reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really happy with the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The merchandise is selling quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is happy with the company,
myself, the customers, the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my little dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I was like, I'm going to make a
seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set my mind to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about steps of how to do it and
I took those steps and it is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm grateful that my efforts are
finally paying off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time, but it is doing
something now and I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually see the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the explosion and I'm really
grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the expansion of my company,
through social media, through all the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I have done in the past few months,
I have made a lot of new friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: some really close friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful for all of the friends
I have made locally and through social
[SPEAKER_00]: media worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to a lot of people that are nowhere
near me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends in other states that I
talk to more than some people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: really close to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody from the people in my
neighborhood, the people in my house,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the people worldwide that I interact
with, my little support team, my
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship circle, I'm fucking super
grateful for each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've texted me and I've replied,
if we've had a conversation, that meant
[SPEAKER_00]: something to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thankful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk too much about my family life
on the podcast because quite frankly,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to talk about cannabis,
but I'm talking about what I'm grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently had a health scare with a
family member and I am extremely grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: he pulled through on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still got a long ways to go,
but it was scary as shit for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days there and I'm extremely grateful that
he is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also super thankful and grateful that
my mom is still in good health.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's probably my, she's certainly my
closest family member.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom's probably my best friend,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really grateful that my mom can be
my best friend and that she is still in
[SPEAKER_00]: good health because she's not a spring
chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's getting up there in age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really thankful that she's still in
fairly good health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm glad my daughter's doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about my kid on the show a
lot, but if I'm talking about shit I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful for, I'm really grateful for that
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything about her I'm grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those are most of the big
major obvious points I should be grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: for my friends, my family, my loved ones,
my business, my general health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful for all of that stuff,
but also there are random things that make
[SPEAKER_00]: me happy every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the fact that I can drive just about
any direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go 10 minutes that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go 10 minutes that way and I will
arrive at a dispensary that allows me to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy some of the best cannabis flowers and
cannabis concentrates on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really grateful for that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent too many years of my life having
to hunt down some good herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent too many years of my life having
to grow good herb just to have it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent too many years of my life having
to watch over my shoulder because I
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful for the situation that
we are in with cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course things could be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things I would adjust with
the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would raise plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make a lot of things a little bit
different, but I am grateful that I'm able
[SPEAKER_00]: to acquire the stuff that I enjoy and not
have to feel like a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something random that I'm suddenly
grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel this medicine I took starting
to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sinuses are loosening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am definitely grateful that I have
access to medicine that when I am not
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling well, I know I'm stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take medicine till I'm about to
die, but I really needed some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally took it and I feel much better
already, so I'm grateful for that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another random thing that I'm really
thankful and grateful for is my ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: play the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very musical on the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very gifted on the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to brag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am more grateful than bragging about it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that I am really proud
of and I feel like I am blessed to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to play the drums the way that I do,
so I'm absolutely grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really feels like a humble brag,
but I'm so grateful because a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: life, I made a living playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traveled around the country playing the
drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got paid playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I kind of learned a lot about
business being sort of the band manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the obnoxious guy in the group most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the big guy in the group a lot of the
times, so I would be the guy that was sent
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell the club owner, fuck you,
pay me, when things didn't go right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot about business by being in
a band and being the drummer, so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful that I had the skills to be a
drummer that took me places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also grateful that I learned some
business throughout that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am super, super grateful and
thankful for the skills I have acquired
[SPEAKER_00]: and developed within the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has taken me far and I owe a
great respect to the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm grateful for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, there are several
things I would change about legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many things I would change
about the cannabis industry, but overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful that the cannabis industry
even exists and I'm grateful to be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in it on any level and I'm
grateful to have been accepted by so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people as a teacher, as an advocate,
and somebody that people look up to and
[SPEAKER_00]: respect in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really thankful and grateful for all
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one last thing just to wrap this up
because my voice sounds like shit and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think this is getting long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super grateful to live in this age of
information and technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should never say I wonder because
there's no need to wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a device in most of our pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pull it out and we can find the
answer to almost anything you wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's some existential shit
you should always wonder, but most facts,
[SPEAKER_00]: most info, it's in your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being a part of this generation,
this time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very grateful that I am a part of
this, whatever we're going to call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: this revolution, this timeframe,
this era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited, thankful, and grateful to be
right here in this time today,
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, thank you for
letting me share things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thankful and grateful for,
I hope I reminded you of a few things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are thankful and grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you for listening to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the episode 370 has not made
it to iTunes at the time of this
[SPEAKER_00]: recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a technical issue with my
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got the web guy working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it is the Thanksgiving holiday
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has got some time with his family,
which I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are putting all of that sort of
stuff on the back burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to enjoy time with our family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get over this head cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take care of this stuff
after the holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything should be back to business
really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you're working with the
internet and computers and coding,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit just goes wonky and this is one of
those times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying not to stress over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to enjoy the holiday
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys enjoy the holiday season also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we get the website fixed,
we will put the episodes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep recording episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some of you have found the
episodes on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is still letting me post.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different method of posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's not stopped at all,
YouTube will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get things back together,
we'll get it all up on iTunes and Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: just like normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, thanks for letting me ramble at
you for a good 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a great, safe
holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're not celebrating
Thanksgiving, wherever you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're doing, I hope you're
hanging out with some loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're eating something delicious
and I hope you got to smoke some great
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products with your friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for me to wrap up this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, my voice sounds a little bit
better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No advertising, no shout outs,
just a big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
I'll see you next time.
