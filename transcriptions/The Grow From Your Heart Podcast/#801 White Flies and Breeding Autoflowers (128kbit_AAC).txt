[SPEAKER_00]: will sell out very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all of the business part
we've got here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into your favorite part of the
podcast, the listener email portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of great emails here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question here in front of me
came from our friend Shannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one did come from the grow help tab
on the iry genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to irygenetics.com, there are a
bunch of tabs at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them says questions or help click
on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to answer a few preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask, what kind of question do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: What stage of are you in veg or flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: What week are you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask a few questions just to help me
answer your question a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one came from our friend Shannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can skip all of the preliminary
questions that were answered because these
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really affect my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand this question and I do
have a good solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Shannon says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have a problem with white flies
and I've begun treatment as such,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am wondering if there's anything
that can be mistaken for white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on to say, however,
I do know the difference between fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats and white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely not fungus gnats because
I have done a podcast recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in the past, trying to talk about
fungus gnats and white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to treat for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it's very important to identify
the pest, which you are attacking that way
[SPEAKER_00]: we can attack properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do know that it is not fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says also I've become quite a fan
and I appreciate your work and efforts in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first episode I ever saw was number
seven 13 about mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you discovered the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for learning and extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great question here,
because this is a great topic to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says PSU can use my name too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm digging your work from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friend,
Shannon from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it sounds like you do know the
difference between fungus gnats and white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not a lot of other things that
will be confused or look like white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes an aphid can look like a white
fly, but here is the main difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids do not fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is that these white
flies are going to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take something, your hand,
your arm, or maybe a stick and you hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to a little white things come
flying up and out of the plant that look
[SPEAKER_00]: like ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, those are white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a little piece of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like an ash and they fly around
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly around a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we have definitely identified that
those are white flies, let's talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about treatment because just
identifying them is only the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about one thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine was facing white flies
and he said, I put yellow sticky traps all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the room, but it is not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow sticky traps are not meant to
eradicate a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow sticky traps are there to indicate
the presence of a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those yellow sticky traps should be yellow
and pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day you'll see a couple of bugs
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll go, Hey, there's something in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark down how many you saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a mental note.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were about 10 of these specific bugs
on this yellow sticky trap yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many there are there in the evening?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many are there tomorrow morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many are there the next day or a
couple landing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a couple of bugs stuck
to your yellow sticky trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got 10 the first day,
50 the next day, 150 the next day,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got an increasing problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those yellow sticky cards are only
indicators of the presence of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not there to eradicate,
eliminate or minimize a pest infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that is to let you know,
Hey, there's bugs here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like having some fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Footsteps in the snow is all that those
guys are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by identifying the
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen them on the yellow sticky
traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about ways to eradicate
these whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would do is defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whiteflies are on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any big leaf, you don't need any leaf with
a purple petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that leaf right out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's strip the plants, clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put all of those leaves into a
sealed container and get that as far from
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could burn that shit, that would be
ideal, but I understand that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: possible for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just go throw it in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't throw that bag of leaves in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just abandon that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bag is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that shit far, far from our
ganja plants, far, far from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also once you're done doing that,
change clothes, clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not take a bunch of whiteflies right
back into the grow after we just did work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step number one, let's heavily defoliate
any plant that is affected by the
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies and also consider defoliating
the other plants that may not be as
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's minimize the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take away their hangout spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not leave a lot of opportunities for
them to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we want to do is do
some defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing I would do is kind of a
wild idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super fun to watch somebody do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a buddy that can get you on
camera, record this, post it, tag me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds wild, but I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I get rid of whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had whiteflies in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually video somewhere on
Instagram of me doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a long stick, whatever kind of long
stick you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of feet long is what I needed for
my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got a shop vac with a long wand on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I can control where I'm pointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys may be able to see where I'm
going with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn on the shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start smacking the plants with the stick
and then I hold the shop vac up toward the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: All those whiteflies fly out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They head up to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right into the shop vac and they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll kind of wave that shop vac
around the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to suck up plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get leaves stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of feather across the top of the
plants, brother, and you will suck up a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of those whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep tapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll keep flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a minute to settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch where they land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the vacuum kind of near there again
and then tap them and they'll go flying
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you've got a vacuum with
the filter in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the shop vacs will shoot those
whiteflies right out of the other end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the shop vac and just shoot them into your
other grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a filter on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some sort of way to catch those
whiteflies once they're sucked into your
[SPEAKER_00]: shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a shop vac, a normal
house vacuum will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that attachment on it to where the one
you use to clean the curtains or the
[SPEAKER_00]: corners or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that attachment on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suck up those whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken away most of their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have also shop vacuum, which was
kind of an assassination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in there and just got rid of most
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took out a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still going to be a few
stragglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about spray applications that I
would recommend to help minimize and
[SPEAKER_00]: eradicate this whitefly infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first product I'm going to recommend
is Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evergreen is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pyrethrin-based product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason Evergreen is going to work very
well for the whiteflies is because they
[SPEAKER_00]: like to congregate on the bottoms of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray the Evergreen on the
underside of the leaves, you'll be sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be an undesirable habitat,
an undesirable environment for the
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply won't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's toxic to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the undersides of your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you apply the pesticide, get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to recommend somewhere between
15 and 30 milliliters of Evergreen per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon of water in a pump sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the shit out of it and apply that to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you spray it, start at the bottom of
the plant and work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to spray the undersides of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're dealing with whiteflies,
also spray the main stalk and the stalks
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is going to do, you need to
spray the bottom of the leaves because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is where the pests hang out the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the bottom and work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, we know that we're coating the
entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting everything covered in
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by starting at the bottom,
you start at the bottom and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: drip from the top to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll actually work your way up and you
can see where you've applied a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it more effective that way by
starting at the bottom and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: undersides of the leaves is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start off with an Evergreen
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if that didn't work or if that is not
available to you, the spray product from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Biocontrol, the Mammoth Pesticide
Spray, I cannot think of the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Canna Control is a great product
that will work for your whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we're going to have to do,
we're going to have to spray every third
[SPEAKER_00]: day until these whiteflies are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to go away on the first
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get rid of a nice percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our first application of Evergreen
should get rid of a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a few stragglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a couple of sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: First spray I would go for is Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in three days, I would rotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use the, what is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mammoth Canna Control if that's
available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, go right back in with that
Evergreen and spray that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Botanic Garden Max is another great
product to put into the rotation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about some more gentle and
simpler products that we can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: eradicate the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that works very good,
very well in my opinion, is a product
[SPEAKER_00]: known as Mosquito Dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sold at most places that sell
anything to do with plants or gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your big box stores, your Lowe's,
your Home Depot, whatever's in your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, they will have Mosquito
Dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get them at Target.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get them at a mom and pop
hardware shop in your area, we always
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go spend your money in your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give it to the big corporate box
store, but they got all the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guarantee that those stores will have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are called Mosquito Dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sold on a red card and they look
like little donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's about six donuts in the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be three, three to six donuts
in the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a little, like a donut or a
hamster lick or a bird feed or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feed it to your pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use this to kill
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I recommend you do with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in a baggie, a thick baggie,
not like a sandwich baggie, a dope baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a gallon Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wrap that in newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use a mallet to crush up the
mosquito dunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it into small bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will take those small bits and put
that directly into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stir it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let that mosquito dunk kind of break
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a while, it just starts to fall
apart like a turd in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just come apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll become flaky and disintegrate in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll get a stick and I'll stir it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll add my other nutrients to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might just put my nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw it all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I'm feeding might just go right
into this mix right along with my mosquito
[SPEAKER_00]: dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will water that into the soil and
that will definitely help get rid of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not want to go back into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point we've defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've sprayed the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are now undesirable for these
whiteflies and we've also drenched our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil with the mosquito dunks, which has
got a beneficial bacteria in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product will work very well to help
get rid of the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very affordable and very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another product that will work very
good for your whiteflies is Monterey
[SPEAKER_00]: garden spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monterey garden spray contains a bacteria
called spinosad and spinosad is very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective against most pests that we're
going to encounter in our cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's recap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like I gave you a lot of
information and I also feel like I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: super duper fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would do, defoliate,
get rid of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are no hotel rooms, there's
nowhere to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs will leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hit them with the shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap the plants, shop vac those little
fuckers as they come flying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hit them with the pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe also get in there and hit them
with the shop vac again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got time, why not shop vac the
shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in three days, hit them with the
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the first time you hit them with that
pesticide, give them a soil drench from
[SPEAKER_00]: those mosquito dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've taken away their hotels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made it undesirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've shop vac the shit out of them to
eradicate most of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're spraying a pesticide to make the
leaves undesirable and we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: drenching the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere for the whiteflies to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get the fuck out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our other option, if you are opposed
to spraying a pesticide or maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: too late into flower and you don't want to
do that, the other option of course is to
[SPEAKER_00]: release predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predator bugs will come in and
eradicate those whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do choose to go the beneficial
insect route, I definitely recommend green
[SPEAKER_00]: lace wings to get rid of the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is another predator mite
called the swirkey, the swirkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say swirkey, S-W-I-R-R-K-I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy will definitely get in there and
eradicate those whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The swirkey, those guys do thrive in warm
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a hot grow space,
which you probably do, which is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The swirkey is a dot swirkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bad motherfuckers will get in there
and eat the shit out of your whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, my first recommendation is the
green lace wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do release their lace wings,
um, I may go for the live lace wings that
[SPEAKER_00]: are active already because you've got a
whitefly infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other time I recommend the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like when they hatch the eggs come on
the cards, they hatch, they turn into
[SPEAKER_00]: these little dinosaur alligators and those
things are super hungry and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go for straight for the living lace
wings at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to eradicate these whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would use to eliminate these
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies are not a huge problem,
but they can become a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry more pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small problem,
the whiteflies will compound every
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got a problem with one
plant, the whiteflies will definitely move
[SPEAKER_00]: that problem to all of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do understand that a lot of us will
be in different phases of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be in veg, we may be an early
flower, mid flower, or late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I recommend those beneficial
insects in veg early flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I will recommend the evergreen
or the, uh, what else was the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: that I said, the botanic guard max or the
botanic guard, uh, WP, which has also got
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bavaria bossiana in there,
which will be very effective against the
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early in flower, I would go with the
evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go with the mammoth candy control
spray later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may go with the botanic guard max
products, the botanic guard products,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't have oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're focusing more on the beneficial
bacteria and the fungus, which is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would rather smoke that than the
oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's going to have a less
detrimental effect on flavor and less
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental effect on the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those beneficial bacterias will dissipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get destroyed by the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they'll get destroyed by the wind and
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those oils are going to stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to taste terrible in your
final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend something like the
botanic guard max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you have to go late in
flower, I never recommended spraying late
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower, but sometimes you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the whiteflies are not destroying your
garden later in flower, maybe write it out
[SPEAKER_00]: unless of course you've got a perpetual
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always something to think about,
but earlier in earlier in the phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go with evergreen as it gets a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would work my way into the botanic guard
and the Bavaria bossiana beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterias as my defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've covered this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question was, can I identify that
they are whiteflies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a picture, but if they fly
around like ashes, if they look like
[SPEAKER_00]: little uh, just white bugs flying around,
that's a white fly, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to treat for the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my friend, Shannon,
thank you for the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you that you win a
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send a message to the grow help tab
on, I read genetics or I read direct.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and I read your message here on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you win a free pack of I
read genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that giveaway is sponsored by
my friends at seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to seeds here now.com
Shannon, please do send me your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the shipping box and an address to
ship these seeds out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from the grow help tab
on I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend flaccid
Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just discovered your podcast and I love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of episodes to go catch up
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So head back toward the back of the
catalog and start listening and listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see what you think about
some of the older content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you've got more actual grow talk
than most podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I do get rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut out the shout outs at the start of
the show because I noticed that was
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing people off and people wouldn't
listen, but I try to stay focused and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't try to overload you with
commercials and shit to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I want you to buy my seeds,
but we covered that at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to keep rambling about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also feel like when you have a
problem and a grow, I don't need to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: you a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to give you, of course,
I just told you things to spray on your
[SPEAKER_00]: shit for the last problem, but I'm not
sponsored by those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gave me any money to recommend
those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend them because they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to grow the best cannabis you
can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this gift of, I can read
something and comprehend it and put it to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I can, uh, repeat and
regurgitate, uh, things that I've read and
[SPEAKER_00]: my experiences in an educational way that
everybody can follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, thanks for thinking there's more
grow talk than most other shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not paid to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't advertise anything, but seeds here
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I try to advertise my own
seed line because that's what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused and get to more actual
grow talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says recently I started some autos,
which I've saved to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some auto flowers going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an auto flower grower or breeder,
but more power to everybody out there
[SPEAKER_00]: working with auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a seed and a plant for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a grower for every seed is how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I saved one seed from each pack to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if you have any experience
using colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do not use colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I strongly, heavily, highly prefer silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works much better on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take as many spray
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's less stressful overall to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't use colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make my own silver thiosulfate,
which I've done a full podcast on making
[SPEAKER_00]: STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called my STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I only want to herm one branch and
not the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me drop this paper and talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant is a herm in any way,
you do not want to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're making feminized seeds,
there is no hermaphrodite, no intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word does not exist when it comes to
making femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are working with a plant that is a
herm, a hermaphrodite, an intersex plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are going to have a failure of a
feminized project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm being very critical,
but I want to make this clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that femme seeds
have some sort of intersex or
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite trait or gene or magic to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very untrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make feminized seeds, I make a lot
of femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell a lot of femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys grow my femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very satisfied with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells me that I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I use a plant to make femme seeds
or any seeds with it, I grow that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and I purposefully stress the shit out of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to cause that plant problems and
turmoil because I want to see how it
[SPEAKER_00]: reacts under pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants that I'm growing with show
me intersex traits, hermaphroditism,
[SPEAKER_00]: what else did you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermes is the other word I saw today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is intersex in any way,
it does not get used in a breeding project
[SPEAKER_00]: because that intersex trait will carry
through into my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys do not deserve or want
intersex plants in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I eliminate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female plants I'm using in my
feminized projects are stress tested to a
[SPEAKER_00]: rigorous level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I am doing is spraying the plants
with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening is the thiosulfate is
helping the silver enter the plant and get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plant system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That silver then disrupts the copper
movement in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant then has an ethylene reaction
which causes it to produce anthers which
[SPEAKER_00]: contain only female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen is only female pollen because
that plant is only a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 100% a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm taking a female plant and I'm doing
science to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science, magic, and nature all meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat it with the chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant then creates pollen sacs which
only contain female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no male.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those words are not involved at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use that female pollen from that
tried treatment and tested female plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been reversed and I put that on
another tried, trued, and tested female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the same female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a clone of the same female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my rant and my disclaimer to
get me started here to talk about your
[SPEAKER_00]: femme seed project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more about
what you actually asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the sake of this conversation,
I am going to replace the word herm with
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse because that is what we are
attempting to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to reverse a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to turn it from a female into a
pollen donating female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we call reversing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only want to reverse is what we're going
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I only want to reverse one branch
of each plant, not the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not crossing just pollinating the
plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you already have an episode discussing
this, I will check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably have done a full episode
talking about this, but we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that got my attention is
it sounds like you've got more multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you want to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly, very highly recommend you only
mess with one reversal at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is microscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen can travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen can get from one reversed plant
over to the other reversed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got what I call a Maury
Povich situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is the baby daddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it this plant or was it this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're never going to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I recommend is only one reversal
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess this project up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know what you've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to self this plant is what you
want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take, let me read and make
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got, let's just say you've got,
this doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you've got golden goat,
auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make golden goat, auto flower
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do now, I did also just come
up with another catch in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with breeding with auto
flowers, so I'm not exactly how this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in your scenario, if you want to self
this plant, which is what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking a hypothetically a golden
goat, auto flower, and you want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: more golden goat, auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you've only got the one plant,
you've got to reverse part of that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and pollinate the other branch of that
plant with the same pollen on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you've got to get more seeds and
put pollen from that plant onto another
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but because you can't cut clones from
the auto flowers, uh, I'm a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: confused when it comes to breeding with
autos, cause I don't ever do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally you would take one auto reverse
it, pollinate autos, other autos,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that way you've got that pollen donor
and you can just pollinate all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about cloning
anything, but you've only got the one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to reverse one
branch or half of the plant and then take
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen and carefully apply it to the
rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that should work in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice I did say should, let's talk about
what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you attempt to reverse a
plant, you will spray just a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: branches to do what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some pollen from one side to pollinate
the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times the plant does not want to
reverse the hormones in that plant are so
[SPEAKER_00]: stubborn that when you treat these few
branches, the hormones from the other part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant go, nah, we're not going to
let it reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so, so dominant or so powerful
and who that plant is that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then other times we get the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to reverse this one branch and the
plants just got those hormones and it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes, watch me and the whole fucking plant
reverses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got three options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may spray a couple of branches and
isolate those and spray those and those
[SPEAKER_00]: will pollinate and you may be able to
pollinate the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you reverse that one side,
the entire plant could reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you go to reverse that one side,
nothing could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got three potential outcomes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, normally, if you're working
with the auto flowers, you would reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: one full plant and then use that as your
pollen donor for multiple females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be the catch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I'm not an auto flower
breeder, so this is the, the closest I can
[SPEAKER_00]: get you with my experience with what I
know, what I would recommend, what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to do probably to reach the
goal you want is grow that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse it, pollinate, reverse one side
and pollinate that other side of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the timing of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I know I trigger the
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray the plant before flower,
and then I can spray it at certain times
[SPEAKER_00]: during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you know how long that plant
veggies or how tall it gets before it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard to anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When to start spraying, unless you spray
immediately when you see pre flowers or
[SPEAKER_00]: right when it goes into flower,
but it's going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your question and your plan will work,
but you're going to have some obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, I recommend doing these two
plants separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next catch is that you're working with
the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get one shot per seed at this because
you cannot clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to grow it, reverse half of
it and successfully pollinate the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get one shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get two shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, I hope this works out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I'm answering the
question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to reverse only one branch,
not the whole plant, not crossing,
[SPEAKER_00]: just pollinating themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, you got three options for
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you already have, I've done an episode
similar to this, but it is not about auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of new caveats and
obstacles in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give the disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an auto flower grower or breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just talking about the experience I
understand from photo period breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part is going to be the
timing, in my opinion, knowing when to
[SPEAKER_00]: start spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the silver thiosulfate,
you've got to spray it one time about a
[SPEAKER_00]: week before flower and then day one of
flower, which how do you determine that
[SPEAKER_00]: with an auto flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess you get to decide when that
happens, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to spray it the day one,
day three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18 and 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be challenging to time that
there is another spray out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot think of the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not tried it, but they claim that
you can spray a plant one time and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's something worth looking
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quite expensive, but if it does what
you need done, I've never thought of an
[SPEAKER_00]: instance where that spray would be worth
the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly this may be the appropriate
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude flaccid Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're able to solve the flaccid
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I hope I helped you out making some
auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got followup questions,
dude, please do reach out because like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said, I'm not an auto flower breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some things I'm going to miss
in this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has some feedback,
any updates, any details, please leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the YouTube comments or send me an
email at grow from your heart at hotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: .com and flaccid Jack, please do send me
your address because guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you a free pack of iry genetic
seeds.
