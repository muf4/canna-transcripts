[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 101 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come to you on a beautiful Friday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a gorgeous Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody's having a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you're doing, I hope you're
smoking something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're taking a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're eating some edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a tasty bowl packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a vape loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you do it, I hope you are
consuming some cannabis with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it is Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just after 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm slightly dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last night was an amazing night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see the legendary reggae band
Israel Vibration in Denver at the Ogden
[SPEAKER_00]: Theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roots Radix was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roots Radix is, of course,
the backing band for Israel Vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel Vibration was solid and on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I feel like it's probably
getting close to the end for that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be one of their final tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little rant about Israel Vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel Vibration is a Jamaican reggae band
that actually met in an orphanage for
[SPEAKER_00]: children with polio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were three members of Israel
Vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of them had polio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several years ago, one member left the
band and now there are only two dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my opinion that one dude looks like
he is done touring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The look on his face during the show just
looks like he's struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polio is getting to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kicking his ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other guy looks like he's doing pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets around quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one guy looks like he may... I don't
think he wants to tour anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the other dude is dragging
him out on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you can't be Israel Vibration
without both of us, so I need you to come
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what it looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may actually catch Israel Vibration
again tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of depends on how things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: After recording here, I'm going to see
what time it is and see if I got anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that wants to go with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may go see some reggae tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, shout out to Israel Vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Roots Radix Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I caught one of the final
tours that these guys are going to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they did one of my favorite
songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did Herb is the Healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The encore, they did Red Eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to the Ogden Theater for
not kicking me out, for smoking a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of weed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one security guard to give me the
look of, hey, chill out on the smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty much all they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't take my shit from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't kick me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much respect, much love to the Ogden
Theater and Israel Vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, before I get too far,
let's do some shout outs and give some
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I need to give thanks and a big
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, everybody
involved in the Mystic Roots crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Stay Positive Productions,
all of those kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, I got mad love for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got much respect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys check out the Mystic
Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let me play their music on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't ask for anything in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them a shout out because they're my
friends and I support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They support positivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They support reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, Catherine Ramirez is the
most beautiful woman in reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out the Mystic
Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Miss Catherine Ramirez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Coot Dogg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good positive shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's give some shout outs to
everybody that showed up for episode
[SPEAKER_00]: number 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give them a personal thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a hell of a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have got a little bit too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if the show got off the rails
a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it goes when everybody's
here and we eat that many edibles and take
[SPEAKER_00]: that many dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to send a huge, sincere
thank you shout out to Spence and Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Sloppy and Joe and also a huge shout
out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody took time out of their day to
come here and be on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super cool of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a huge shout out to a
couple of brands and sponsors that I
[SPEAKER_00]: missed on episode 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was focused on having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that, but I skipped one part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to give a shout out to my good
friends at Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody at Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support Oil Slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to a good friend,
Task Rock and highly educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Task used to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oil Slick used to sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all still family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout out to Dougie and the
Hitman Glass crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be dabbing the way I dab
without Oil Slick, highly educated and
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what keeps me dabbing the way that
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, big shout out to the Garden
of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Garden of Whedon keeps me well
medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got most of the shout
outs covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else do I need to shout out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who I need to give the biggest,
hugest thank you and shout out to?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that listens to this podcast,
everybody that supports this show,
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast wouldn't happen without you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it partly for me because I feel like
I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just comes out of me naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go crazy if I didn't do the
podcast nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do it for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my gift to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been blessed with the ability to
learn a whole bunch about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been blessed to be around people that
love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm very privileged to be in
this position, in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this state, in this time and age where
I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm really blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gift, so I feel like I need to
share it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all of you people for
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone that subscribes, everybody that
interacts with me on social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank each and every one of you
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving all of you a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to the microphone, fist bump right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fist bump on the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect, much love to everybody who
supports the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, an extra special shout out to
everybody who watches me on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've got a nice little following
on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm jumping on and seeing all my crew on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody that jumps on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think that's enough
shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's enough ass kissing for one
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some business here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, we talked about some
more issues with pesticides at a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pulling up the article right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article comes from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, of course, is written by David
Magoya and Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to make that all into one name
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says a second marijuana business in
Denver in just over a week has voluntarily
[SPEAKER_00]: recalled its products because they contain
a pesticide not allowed for use on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver health officials announced the
recall by Nature's Cure, which also is
[SPEAKER_00]: known as Colfax Pot Shop, Wednesday,
after tests found high levels of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide that cannot be legally used to
grow the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recall extends to all of the company's
plant material as well as its concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased before October 6th, according to
the Denver Department of Environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business has one retail location at
1500 East Colfax.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pesticide Spiromefacin was detected
during follow-up tests at Colfax Pot Shop
[SPEAKER_00]: after inspectors found pesticides in
cannabis the shop had grown and sent to a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility for processing into various forms
of marijuana infused products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That facility, Mahatma, has also been the
source of its own recall over pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: An employee who answered the phone at
Nature's Cure said its owners did not have
[SPEAKER_00]: a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recalled products include dried
medical marijuana with cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility number 403-00651 on the label,
dried recreational marijuana with the
[SPEAKER_00]: number 403R-00035 on the label,
and concentrates from The Lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: Craft 710, TC Labs, Lab 710, or Mahatma
showing either number on their label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you have dried marijuana,
if you bought cannabis, that's pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, you guys, if you bought dried
marijuana and the cultivation facility
[SPEAKER_00]: number on the label is 403-00651,
take it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought dried recreational marijuana
with the number 403R-00035 on the label,
[SPEAKER_00]: take that shit back and concentrates from
The Lab, Craft 710, TC Labs, Lab 710,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Mahatma showing either one of those
numbers on their labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, take those products back to
where you purchased them and either ask
[SPEAKER_00]: for an exchange for something without
pesticides in it or get your damn money
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know the return policy on any
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not give you back your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may give you a store credit for a
product, but whatever you do, go exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not wanna smoke this pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, consumers are urged to destroy
the product or return it to the place of
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase is what the article says.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the second business this month to
issue a recall of its marijuana over
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns that potentially dangerous
pesticides were used to cultivate the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other, True Cannabis, issued a recall
on October 13th after tests determined
[SPEAKER_00]: three disallowed pesticides were used to
grow plants that were later processed into
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana-infused products or MIPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with Colfax Pot Shop, plants grown by
True Cannabis and sent to Mahatma for
[SPEAKER_00]: processing were found to contain the
pesticides, health officials said.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been no reports of illness
associated with any of these recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, in my opinion, it's gonna take a
long time for health effects to be
[SPEAKER_00]: noticeable from smoking a pesticide like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor, I'm not a scientist,
but these are the kinds of things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke them today and you don't notice it
until you're 20 years down the road and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got some fucked up tumor in your
lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some weird cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got something in your mouth that
grew from this pesticide that you smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things will not affect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things will go into your
body and affect your body in really crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: ways and they will affect future
generations of your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware of what you're consuming,
you guys, and I don't think that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to start reporting these
illnesses for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody did smoke something with a
little too much pesticide on it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: got sick right away, but that's very
uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have been through the drying
and curing phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see, smell, or feel this shit on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be lab tested to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mips often contain much higher
concentrations of pesticides than dried
[SPEAKER_00]: plants processed for smoking because of
the method used to extract THC and other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, pesticide levels dissipate quickly
in dried marijuana, while amounts found in
[SPEAKER_00]: mips typically do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, that is extremely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make hash, if you take a bud,
a plant that has been sprayed with
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, and you make hash with it,
sometimes we can see the pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: floating on the top of the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a little sheen sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this little greasy layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we'll make a batch of hash and
let it finish, and then you can touch the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of it, and you can feel on your
fingers a little oily layer of neem oil or
[SPEAKER_00]: stylet oil, or whatever type of oily
product was applied to the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can see that floating on top
of the hash, and it's hard to get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna make your hash taste like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop spraying your plants with bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I will continue with the article
because I feel like I've gotten myself off
[SPEAKER_00]: track.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recall is a fourth announced by the
Denver Department of Environmental Health
[SPEAKER_00]: since it began cracking down on pesticides
last spring, quarantining 100,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worries about pesticides and marijuana
are the result of federal laws that deem
[SPEAKER_00]: the drug illegal, and as a result,
safety tests have not been done on the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals when specifically ingested on
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana can be classed as either food or
a drug because of various ways it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law deems it a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: State agriculture officials have proposed
a rule that would limit the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides allowed for use in growing
marijuana to about 75 of the least
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule would allow manufacturers of
pesticides among the improved products to
[SPEAKER_00]: petition the government to let marijuana
growers use its chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company would have to first approve
the pesticide as safe to humans and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, growers can use more than 200
pesticides the state says has warning
[SPEAKER_00]: labels so broad that using the product on
cannabis would not violate federal laws
[SPEAKER_00]: that require chemicals to be used only as
directed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open up any pesticide,
there's that little booklet attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is pop that open and it
unfolds, and there are a bunch of rules
[SPEAKER_00]: and regulations in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells you how you can apply that
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what it can be used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what type of crops it can be used
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a window of reentry listed on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will say, if you spray this product,
do not reenter this room for up to four
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, or if you do enter the room,
be in proper equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a ventilator, use some type of
covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a lot of things written on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not use that pesticide the way
that that direction label says to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are in violation of federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a farmer in an agricultural business is
caught using those pesticides improperly,
[SPEAKER_00]: he will be fined.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will face a federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: His farm will face penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is serious stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize how important this was
and how serious this was until I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of training from the Colorado
Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, pay attention to those
warnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is serious shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not notice how much risk you are
putting yourself in when you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that you go and read about
each pesticide that you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about each ingredient in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what it is derived from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what it is going to do to you in
small concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what it is going to do to you in
large concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what you are exposing yourself
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about what you are putting on your
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are spraying people's ... it may be
recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, find out what you are spraying
on the stuff that you are giving to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that you care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are taking money for a product,
if you are giving this product as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical treatment, you need to take pride
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your responsibility to make sure
that no bullshit goes into your customers
[SPEAKER_00]: or your patients, your clients,
whatever you want to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their lungs and bodies should be treated
like a temple, and it is your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility that their cannabis is
clean and safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your job as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about all the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to continue and read the last
line of the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Despite the allowance,
state officials have said they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: endorse the use of pesticides on marijuana
because there is no data to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice if we did not have to use
any pesticides at all on growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is very unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pests everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are building a new facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our grow facility is basically the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a rocky desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of the facility, there are
lizards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tarantulas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are centipedes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have built this facility from the
ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a sealed facility, and still
occasionally, I will have to escort a baby
[SPEAKER_00]: tarantula out of the building or chase
down a lizard out of the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to keep shit out of buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects are much smaller than these
tarantulas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pot pests are much smaller than
tarantulas and lizards, so keeping them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there will sometimes require some
sort of a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we are going to finish the
building and we will seal it up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to keep shit out, is my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some type of pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some type of prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some type of integrated pest
management system that will keep the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, that requires some sort of
a bottled pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to use it, you guys be
responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the Department of Agriculture,
read about what you are using,
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn what you are applying to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to take a quick dab and a
drink, and then we will get on with the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for one quick second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am nicely dabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my
friend Maddie from the Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Maddie a bunch of Girl Scout
Cookies flowers that I grew, and she
[SPEAKER_00]: turned it into some delicious oil for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is some snap and peel, kind of almost
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It snaps a little more than it shatters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little warm in here, so that may
have something to do with it, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes delicious, and it gets me high
as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a big shout out to Maddie for the
amazing girls scout cookies hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work, girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to bringing you some more
material to turn into hash for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I have got another
news article on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our neighbors to the
north out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article was sent to me by our good
buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is up, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sending me some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry you could not join me tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is hanging out with his lovely wife
and their new baby, so a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Mike family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody is doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys follow Mike on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posts a whole bunch of great cannabis
news, things that will educate you,
[SPEAKER_00]: things you would appreciate seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like I said, this article comes from
our good friends in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada has elected a new prime minister
who seems to be on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this article comes from Vice
News.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was written by Rachel Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, Justin Trudeau held the
best thing that has ever happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian weed, and the article goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin Trudeau has not even been
officially sworn in as prime minister yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as far as marijuana advocates are
concerned, his promise to fully legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: it is as good as fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potts Legal wrote Mark Emery, Canada's
so-called Prince of Pot, the day after
[SPEAKER_00]: Trudeau and his Liberal Party won the
federal election by a landslide.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of Mr. Trudeau's official declarations
should be, the war against cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture in Canada is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: By securing a majority government,
the Liberals are poised to move quickly on
[SPEAKER_00]: their pledge to legalize, regulate,
and restrict access to marijuana for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use, which Trudeau has billed
as a top priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though the incoming prime minister has yet
to specify what exactly legalizations
[SPEAKER_00]: would look like, and it could take years
for it to come to fruition, things are
[SPEAKER_00]: already looking up for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to all the people that got me
doing a fat dab right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a dab, and let's cure my stutter
problem on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aw yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm carb cappin' and freestyle rappin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm pretty sure I was reading
an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's find where I was, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an oddly worded statement there at
the end of that paragraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like there are missing a couple
short words here, like thes and ands in
[SPEAKER_00]: some spots, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the Canadian marijuana space could
be set for another revolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: Saul said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce Linton, CEO of Tweed, the largest of
Canada's 26 licensed cannabis producers,
[SPEAKER_00]: told Vice News in a previous interview
that the medical marijuana industry can
[SPEAKER_00]: only benefit under a new legal regime,
as it will likely facilitate the
[SPEAKER_00]: production for recreational marijuana,
similarly to the way things unfolded in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that for licensed producers,
which are large, regulated, and under
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled shipping and accounting
procedures,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the first choice for delivery,
because that's the first methodology to
[SPEAKER_00]: gain control of the supply chain,
said Linton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this year, Health Canada
threatened to send some RC, it's Royal
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian, mounted police officers to shut
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dancing in the streets, said Don
Pereira, who owns a number of Vancouver
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, Jacobs Securities, a
Toronto-based investment firm that
[SPEAKER_00]: specializes in advising companies on the
cannabis sector, launched a $50 million
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis fund to focus on opportunities in
Canada and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin Trudeau getting elected is the best
thing that's ever happened to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, Cheryl Schuman, founder of the
Beverly Hills Cannabis Club and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fund's lead advisors, said in an interview
with
[SPEAKER_00]: Vice News, speaking of Cheryl Schuman,
I want to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Mickey Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Mickey Martin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mickey Martin and Mickey
Martin Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going with the article
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know what I'm talking about,
high five me mentally right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The firm's other lead advisor is George
Smitherman, Ontario's former health
[SPEAKER_00]: minister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analysts have suggested that a fully
legalized cannabis market expansion is the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary goal, with little consideration of
the impact on public health, the article
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's something that we kind of
overlooked here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started writing all of our
marijuana laws in Colorado, in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of forgot that big cannabis would
take over, and I see it happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's happening here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were tons of shops here that were
mom and pop shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys like myself with some dreadlocks and
some growing skills would grow our hearts
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up a shop and get shit going,
but then all of the new regulations have
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed people in that realm out because it
is so expensive to open up a shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so expensive to afford all of the
security.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so expensive to pay for all of the
licensing that only rich dudes that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know anything about cannabis can own
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that is not 100% true, but that is a
lot of what I saw happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that held on,
a lot of people that persevered and made
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the industry, but very few of them
survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Scott Reach for making
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude made it from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the beginning, killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you want to be a cannabis
entrepreneur, find out who Scott Reach is
[SPEAKER_00]: and read about that dude, learn how that
dude did it, and you'll realize that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do whatever the hell you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: In August, Trudeau said his new government
would look into pardoning Canadians
[SPEAKER_00]: serving time in prison for marijuana
related crimes after he repeals the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: in the criminal code.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude's going to go and release
Canadians serving time in prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana related crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their new prime minister is awesome,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine if we got a president
like this in America?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's highly unlikely, but could
you imagine if that shit happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be so amazing if our government
actually governed us in a way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: found favorable instead of governing us in
a way that we all feel like we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: ripped the fuck off and it's only
benefiting 1% of our nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be amazing if they actually felt some
compassion for us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more paragraph in this
article, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been many situations over history
when laws come in that overturn previous
[SPEAKER_00]: convictions, he said, at a campaign stop
in Vancouver, and there will be a process
[SPEAKER_00]: for that that we will set up in a
responsible way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, also make sure you follow the
lady that wrote this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her name is Rachel Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's on Twitter at RP underscore Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown with an E at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canada has basically legalized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new prime minister, Trudeau,
Justin Trudeau, I hope I'm saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: right, Justin Trudeau says that when he
gets into office, he's going to do what he
[SPEAKER_00]: can to make cannabis legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I heard him say, I didn't hear
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said in an article that I read that
within 18 months of him taking office,
[SPEAKER_00]: he would legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some looking, I did some thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 months after this dude takes office
will be the middle of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by 420 in 2017, is that when it'll be?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017, 420, Canada will have legalized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did that math wrong, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a corrections department.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's all I've got
for you this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on the episode about CBD
still.
