[SPEAKER_10]: They call him THC Sam.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is Sam from THC Magazine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Instagram, it's THC underscore Samuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I appreciate being included.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: And next, let's get the mic a little
closer because I'm not sure we got you too
[SPEAKER_10]: much, but I'll make sure that we pump you
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're good, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll guide you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now the guy that's excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're bouncing in your chair,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Instagram over there, Mr. Fish Eye on
the phone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since everyone here is a turp or he is a
turp sled.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's our turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a slut.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a slut.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the white turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are the turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That name was given to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not declare that myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I did not proclaim that myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rooster Brat, the turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything Granny says to me, I'll take.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's official shit once Granny says it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brent is, of course, the lab manager at
Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_10]: He is partially responsible for all these
beautiful cannabis extracted terpenes that
[SPEAKER_10]: we've been enjoying and we truly
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk about terpene
extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try to pry into his
business a little bit here in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: On these cozy couches with Dev and Granny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Orange Soda.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this Orange Soda hash that Granny
brought.
[SPEAKER_10]: Last time it was so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_10]: She went and got more for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: She says that if this hash keeps becoming
available from Incredibles, she's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: go broke.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I will be down on Nevada in my high
heels and my red lips and my painted
[SPEAKER_12]: fingernails Monday through Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: to 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: All donations to Dev and Granny on that
corner post.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now please, please do not go through
the turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_12]: You must go through the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_12]: She is my official manager for Nevada.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's introduce to the podcast the
official, the traveling stoner,
[SPEAKER_10]: Dev and Granny's Turp Pimp.
[SPEAKER_10]: This podcast started off wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can we work together or something?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get her and I can get your guy or
something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I got you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did this show just become Tinder?
[SPEAKER_10]: What just happened over here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bender, Tinder, Grindr, whatever those
things are.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Podcast listeners, I'm going to put
[SPEAKER_10]: this show back on track a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might come join us.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might come take some dabs with Bobo
Blastercoat with Dev and Granny.
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know who could be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: The traveling stoner is here quite
frequently.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might get to meet Biddy the dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: You may meet Sirius.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: This place is cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's classy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: The couches are comfy.
[SPEAKER_10]: The air conditioning is kicking and it's
the summertime.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the place to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dev and Granny, I see you here a lot now
that I've bumped into you and met you.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is my favorite dad loan.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is like sitting in somebody's living
room.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it that there are no TVs here.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the other social lounges have TVs and
everyone just zones out into a TV.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or there's pool tables.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is like mine, sitting down,
dabbing, talking, exchanging knowledge and
[SPEAKER_12]: giggles.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of giggles today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exchanging terps, exchanging grown
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_10]: I made a new friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend Sam over here has also
experienced a head injury and he's writing
[SPEAKER_10]: a book about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we talk about your book?
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a little closer, a little closer.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get you introduced.
[SPEAKER_10]: When do you plan?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, you heated up a nail and then I
started talking to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to miss that dab opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_10]: When do you expect your book to come out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you have that book prepared,
I'd love to read it and have you on the
[SPEAKER_10]: show and talk about it because it's great
talking to other people that have
[SPEAKER_10]: experienced traumatic brain injuries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thankfully, you know, I grew up in
a, you know, my parents were pretty big
[SPEAKER_03]: fans of holistic medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't really, they weren't too big
of a fan to put me right on any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceuticals, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thankfully that was a pretty great
decision on their part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually to speak something else,
to speak on something else besides head
[SPEAKER_03]: injuries, when I was in college,
I blew out some ligaments in my knee.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabis is much more of an effective
pain reliever than a lot of the opioids
[SPEAKER_03]: that you get prescribed so quickly and in
such large doses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabis is really just something that
a lot of people should really be more
[SPEAKER_03]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if even not aware of, just more
accepting of.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And no addiction.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you don't go down that black spiral.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't go down that black spiral.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hope everybody can be on the lookout
for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if everybody wants to follow the hemp
connoisseur on Instagram as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to get everybody kind of more
aware of hemp and everything that it can
[SPEAKER_03]: do as well as everything that cannabis
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're kind of trying to really spread the
message.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, it's our sister plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's classified as the same thing,
unfortunately, even though it's a textile
[SPEAKER_10]: and not a... Brett, what are you so
excited about over there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he also wrote this dope ass article
from Dream Lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see some really nice pieces that I'd
love to read sometime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this has like a real nice wide array
of like everything in cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a little bit of glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a little bit of edible knowledge,
a little grow knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent magazine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for joining us, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brett, let's talk about Terps,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of building it up so we can save
Granny a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like Terps though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll turn Granny on for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love how cocky you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I feel like that's my favorite part
about you, Brett.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just love Brett.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: How can you not love Brett?
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he's just a walking smile with Terps
in his pocket.
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a walking smile with Terps in his
pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably the best compliment I've
ever gotten.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So tell us more about... So on the... We
recorded this podcast before and I asked,
[SPEAKER_10]: explain to me what a Terp is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice and easily so that everybody... Keep
in mind that more than 50% of my listeners
[SPEAKER_10]: are from a place where cannabis is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they know very basically the basic
knowledge about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's break it down to where they're
able to follow along with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Terpenes are in basically every type
of... Well, there's two different types of
[SPEAKER_05]: things that could be in fruits or
vegetables and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terpenes are esters, but a lot of stuff
that you get either a smell from or a
[SPEAKER_05]: taste from comes from something type of
Terpene combination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Terpenes are in apples, oranges,
bananas, everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also are in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, from my understanding, as of right
now, there hasn't been any esters found in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, but there are tons of Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are over 115 Terpenes,
150 Terpenes that make up kind of a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right now, the best labs can maybe
test for 30 of them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe 30, maybe the best labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I honestly don't even know how
accurate those 30 tests, those 30 Terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: to testing is actually how accurate they
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, and then after that, there's some
companies that can go for 15 or even 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, it's, that's basically,
there's a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_05]: Terpenes that make up a plant profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Terps are basically what give a
cannabis plant its smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's smell, it's taste, but also there's a
lot more than just smell and taste to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy Sam next to me knows a lot
about the health benefits and actually
[SPEAKER_05]: knows a lot about Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what actually the big article
in the magazine is about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he knows a lot about the health
benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lot of stuff to do with the
floral, the smell, the smell of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what most people that buy it
only understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have learned a lot from Sam about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the way Sam set up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows his shit when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say I'm a total expert,
but I've definitely had a chance to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit about Terpenes on a little
bit of a different level, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the articles in the summer
edition of the hemp connoisseur and
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically as popular as Terpenes are
for flavor, they do a lot more medically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had a chance to talk with Max
Montrose.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the head of the TRICOM Institute and
he is probably the Terpene head,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Terpene expert.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he gave me a really nice little
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Terpenes are basically the way he
described it and the way that I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: explained it in the article is basically
like a glass of beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you have a fresh cannabis plant,
that's a fresh glass of beer with all of
[SPEAKER_03]: those bubbles floating off, all that
carbonation floating up to the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, that disappears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time with a fresh cannabis plant,
those fresh oils, those fresh Terpenes on
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the plant are going to
disappear over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those not only add flavor,
but they also add, depending on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpene, a lot of medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are anti-psychotic,
they're anti-seizure, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a whole lot of different things
that we're just really starting to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, depending on what time of harvest
you do with the plant, you can also pull
[SPEAKER_05]: different Terpenes with it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that, Jeff, I don't know if you,
I mean, you grow a lot more than I do,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I know that if you chop plants,
certain plants earlier, certain plants
[SPEAKER_05]: late, you can get a higher CBG or CBN rate
usually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can actually help with what,
in the end, what Terpenes you pull off
[SPEAKER_05]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really what fascinated me most,
I think, about my conversation with Max
[SPEAKER_03]: Montrose is really that what people think
is the medical benefit coming from
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids might really be coming from
Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really kind of, you have to really
combine the two to really get a full
[SPEAKER_03]: picture of really what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause every strain has CBD, CBN,
CBG, depending on the strain to some
extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what really differentiates a lot of
strains is that Terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause not every strain is going to have
that certain combination of Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the combination of that Terpene profile
and the cannabinoids in that specific
[SPEAKER_03]: strain kind of contribute to the overall
effect and the overall medical benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: that people get.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've noticed when I take a small dab and I
dunk it into a little bit of Terps,
[SPEAKER_10]: I get way higher than I would get from a
dab a little bit bigger than that dab
[SPEAKER_10]: size, if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so there's still studies going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely understand what Sam's talking
about and I've read about it and I do have
[SPEAKER_05]: talked to Max and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do know that there are still more
studies, hopefully, that there's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be even bigger studies going on,
obviously, with the advancement of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis in this community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully more studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what Sam was saying is really true,
how without Terpenes, cannabinoids might
[SPEAKER_05]: not transfer in your brain or transfer in
your body the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what kind of might, there's
still studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, don't quote me, obviously,
but I know that there's people talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about without the Terpenes, you can't get
the same effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of true because I've felt
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you don't get the full... Wouldn't
a good example be taking the distillate?
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is pretty much all the Terps are
pulled out.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you smoke that by itself,
which you're not supposed to do,
[SPEAKER_12]: we're not advocating that at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can smoke distillate by itself,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, you should put some Terps in
it, it could taste good.
[SPEAKER_12]: It tastes way better with Terps.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to say 100% better with
Terps.
[SPEAKER_12]: It tastes terrible without the Terps,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's still great by itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on what... What?
[SPEAKER_06]: You think it's good?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still great by itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% amazing with the Terps.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Terps is like the cherry on top.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just puts it on a whole new level.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice thing on the cornflakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoke distillate, honestly, every day,
all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: No flavors?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I do put Terps in it sometimes,
but honestly, sometimes not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't mind raw distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Jeff actually took a nice... He
tried to take a nice half-gram dab of some
[SPEAKER_05]: distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: One night I had the secret session.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just walked up, I had this half-gram
distillate left in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, who wants to take this right
now to the Dome?
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jeff honestly was like... I'll do
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll do that right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take that dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed like you were on your way to ask
a specific question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get to ask what you were trying to
ask?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a brain fart now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do want to say, wow, nice pressing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about this awesome... Rebel's
glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, guys... Rebel's iron.
[SPEAKER_06]: His iron has little presses.
[SPEAKER_06]: These things are awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give a big shout out to this local
artist, Rebel's glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought my Rebel recycler with me,
of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rebel glass out of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just so happens my little iron matches.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of sold me now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of need to get one now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those little irons are adorable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It presses it so unbelievably.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to use tons of little
tools and bottom of jars and little flat
[SPEAKER_06]: glass surfaces I could find, but this
thing is perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can press out a really wide piece of
solventless.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's explain what we're talking about a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like literally like a two inch by
one inch.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really looks like a glass iron.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like an iron that you would iron your
clothes with, but just glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you would heat that up to press out
some of this full melt ice hash that we
[SPEAKER_06]: have here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fold it between a piece of parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep the iron a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just press it out and make it flat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just ironing out, just like a shirt
trying to get all the creases out of it,
[SPEAKER_06]: get it all flat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't goop up on the nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't get as funky.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have you come over and iron
my shirts for me sometime.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that little tiny iron.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the big difference is that does not
leave your nail black.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That solventless does burn nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lindsay, it looks like you're trying to
sneak something in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I'm really sad how much you
like those irons, because there was two
[SPEAKER_02]: purple ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny got one of them and there was
another one and I was like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_02]: I should scoop that because it matches his
rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yo, he's not going to want
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be like, why'd you buy me an
iron?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, crap, that one's gone and I
feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way life goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about terps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ask away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny was onto something about terps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ask away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Distill it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny was thinking that we- Oh,
I would, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: My point was that I do believe you get a
better medicated feeling once you add any
[SPEAKER_12]: of the terps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I like in the morning, I like that
lemon G.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh God, you know I love lemon G.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or the Ghost Train Haze.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's wonderful for in the morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are my two favorites, Granny,
all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: At night, Zenberry or that Blackberry
Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I personally feel that without
terpenes, cannabinoids wouldn't transfer
[SPEAKER_05]: in your body the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the same way as, I don't want to say
the right way, the same way as they do
[SPEAKER_05]: right now with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know one thing is I love terps.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love terps too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think all of us do.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got you.
[SPEAKER_10]: My question, I forgot the question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you give me examples of like what
specific terpenoids work for specific
[SPEAKER_10]: conditions, what they may help with?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we already know, a lot of us know
that like high THC strains will work well
[SPEAKER_10]: for seizures.
[SPEAKER_10]: High CBD works good for like epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, he's got an article in his hand to
refer to.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it when people come with research.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we're going to learn what
terpenoids will help with specific
[SPEAKER_10]: ailments.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's pulling out a chart, helping them
find the right page.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to his page turner, Brett,
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the first example that I'm
looking at right here is Humaline.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would that kind of smell like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Humaline is common in a lot of sativa
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, in terms of medicinal
value, it's anti-tumoral, anti-bacterial,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it has anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Steep Hill Labs has done a lot of
research on individual terpenes and their
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another place that I've done some
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I can tell you about Humaline,
it's also a natural, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_12]: eat.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a diet pill almost.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that's it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brain fart.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you give me a couple more examples,
like maybe one or two more?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure our listeners would love
learning about the terms as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: BTWs, you can read all of this in THC
Magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to make him read his whole
magazine, but I wanted to get at least two
[SPEAKER_10]: or three good examples.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just another shout out to THC Magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a quote from Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steep Hill, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Linolule is a critical precursor in the
formation of vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been used in the treatment of both
psychosis and anxiety and as an
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-epileptic agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that one smell like?
[SPEAKER_10]: Linolule is very floral, like lavender.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably my least favorite turf.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do not appreciate the smell of
lavender and lilacs.
[SPEAKER_10]: It drives my nose crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me want to sneeze and pick my
nose for some reason, like there's chunks
[SPEAKER_10]: in my nose.
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells like bathroom stuff,
like your grandma's bathroom.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny, I love you sometimes.
[SPEAKER_12]: My bathroom doesn't smell like that,
but it does smell like grandma's bathroom.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could smell your bathroom.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody served me rose ice cream and they
asked me what I thought.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, it tastes like grandma's
bathroom.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've never eaten rose ice cream again.
[SPEAKER_10]: I ruined that for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: One more term for me, my friend,
please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what common one that everybody
loves, D-lemonine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that lemony, really citrusy
flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been shown to be helpful with
symptoms of depression and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So different terpenes are definitely
useful for a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're only really just starting to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully- Is that why we love it so
much?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it helps us not be anxious and
helps us not be depressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why a lot of sativa strains are
really uplifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They help with depression.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably- Brett, what's your
favorite term?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to say limonine or
probably mersinine.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mersinine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like mersinine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like pining.
[SPEAKER_12]: I probably go limonine too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that lemon as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys are growing- Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to reveal a crow tip that is a
million dollar tip that I don't say a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: on the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said this one time in a way previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen up.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a sativa strain that has
lemony flavors and lemon characteristics
[SPEAKER_10]: and you want to bring out the D-lemonine
terpenoids, let it get a little bit too
[SPEAKER_10]: close to the light and it will panic and
it will start creating D-lemonine as a
[SPEAKER_10]: panic response and defense.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that'll bring out your lemony flavors.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I learned this on accident by getting
my plants too close to the light too many
[SPEAKER_10]: times.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, why are they always so
lemony?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, wait, those are the plants
that almost got burned.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm 90% sure that that's what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's from my experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think getting the plants too close to
the HPS light will bring out the limonine.
[SPEAKER_12]: So do it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for sharing that Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I tell you how I found you?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think through the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we know Brett.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the phone snatcher.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you subscribed THC Sam to the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_05]: If he's not listening, I don't know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to go hog time or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brett will grab your phone and subscribe
you to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got an iPhone and you're around
Brett, you will open up your phone one day
[SPEAKER_10]: and you'd be like, when did I subscribe to
a podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab your friend's phone and subscribe
them to the Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely got to admit I've been
lacking on the podcast game.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will be subscribing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't expect everybody to listen to 140
episodes of me rambling.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't expect that.
Why?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm almost there.
[SPEAKER_12]: You like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hashtag you like it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's your podcast?
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey guys, by the way, special shout out to
Rasta Jeff for this podcast that aired on
[SPEAKER_12]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, this guy pulled it together and it
was like, wow, what a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: You are a pro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what she's referring to you guys is,
so I was going to put the podcast together
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I better throw an intro on
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Put the memory card in the computer,
put the part that we recorded at the
[SPEAKER_10]: Canyon into a show and then put an outro
on it and post it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I pulled out my memory card and it
said files are unreadable.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had to pull a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was about eight or nine o'clock and the
podcast usually drops at midnight.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had three or four hours to put
together a podcast, record it,
[SPEAKER_10]: edit it up, air it, get it up on the
website.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I pulled it off, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was up there by 1159.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for all the love.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I got the notification, I was like,
is it an encore?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I listened, I was like, wow,
kudos.
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily I've got some notes prepared for,
I try to stay one or two shows in advance.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually there's a show that'll come out
before this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: 148 came out today.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is 150.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've obviously got one in the can ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, shout out to my friends that help
me record podcasts all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate all of you guys, the guys
that are here and not here for taking
[SPEAKER_10]: hours out of their day to come take dabs
and record podcasts with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate each and every one of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tough job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, honestly, if we have to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that Wally Pop medicated?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I wish it was, but Lindsay's donuts
were medicated.
[SPEAKER_12]: What donut?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, last time, first of all,
I tried to give you a donut last time on
[SPEAKER_02]: the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starfire Edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's those little donuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have shout out to Starfire Edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are made with solventless hash and
they are incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: She makes amazing different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: She makes cake cones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't go into it too much, but Starfire
Edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like you like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're my favorite edibles right now
actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm afraid of edibles.
[SPEAKER_10]: The people that listen to the podcast know
that I ate way too many edibles one time
[SPEAKER_10]: and I've been kind of gun shy since then.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go this direction again.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was telling granny about how I found
her.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was scrolling through Facebook one day
and there was no sound in the video.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to cut the sound out,
but they're like, check out this lady.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just somebody reposting your
video.
[SPEAKER_10]: You took a big ass dab, like a dab that I
would take probably a half a gram,
[SPEAKER_10]: at least a point three, maybe a point
five.
[SPEAKER_10]: You sucked that dab in, you held it in,
you chugged a beer, you chugged a shot,
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you grabbed your, you blew out
your dab and you grabbed your,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, your nectar collector and did another
dab and blew that one out and smiled at
[SPEAKER_10]: the camera like nothing had happened.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of what I'm known for.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what she does.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess you should not be proud of it,
but I am.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because really, can you see your mother or
your grandma doing a knockout and smiling?
[SPEAKER_12]: And then most people think, oh,
she's laid out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll come back and do another big dab for
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been, we probably smoked,
there's six people here in this group.
[SPEAKER_10]: We probably smoked three or four grams of
shatter in the hour that we've been
[SPEAKER_10]: hanging out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been some that's been consumed and
granny takes a lot of big dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: She is not shy.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's taking more dabs than me because I
feel like I try to keep my throat a little
[SPEAKER_10]: composed for the show, but granny goes in,
she takes some big old dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: We all have been dabbing out.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, everybody needs to watch social
media for the best group dab ever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's going to post that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's a- I'm going to post it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He already did actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about to go up on the THC magazine
account, the hemp connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you follow the hemp connoisseur
account on Instagram so you can see our
[SPEAKER_10]: group dab video.
[SPEAKER_10]: There were six of us doing a big dab over
here at the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was glorious.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's still very smoky in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually cracked the door.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you smoke out the smoke lounge.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like every time we come here,
they crack the back door.
[SPEAKER_10]: I take big dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to clean out their e-nail a
couple of times, their rig because I've
[SPEAKER_10]: globbed it all up.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been like, who's here globbing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just in the corner.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I take big dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how I found dabbing granny was
watching her do strikeouts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then somebody was like, she lives in
Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they're like, she shops at
Elevate.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I started following you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, this lady and I cross
paths.
[SPEAKER_10]: We go to all the same places.
[SPEAKER_10]: You shop at Green and Healthy Wellness
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_10]: You support all the dispensaries in town,
which is what I love.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that you don't just go pick one
place and say that they're the best.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that you go experience all the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of am a representative for the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm going to go all over.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to give one dispensary my
plant count because that wouldn't be fair.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wouldn't be fair for somebody to say,
oh, we own the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a free agent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to kind of tell everybody
what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Colorado, if you're a medical marijuana
patient, you were allowed to grow a
[SPEAKER_10]: specific amount of plants, based on what
your doctor feels is appropriate,
[SPEAKER_10]: based on your medical condition or
honestly, based on how much money is in
[SPEAKER_10]: your pocket.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just costs more, honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you pay for an elevated plant count is
what we call it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you can, that allows you to grow
more plants and also to position more
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you go to a dispensary in Colorado
Springs, we are medical cannabis only.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way that those dispensaries are
able to grow is those plants that those
[SPEAKER_10]: patients have, they can allow the
dispensary to grow those plants for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: We call it signing over your card,
signing over your plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: You become a member.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what granny's talking about is
she's not going to let anybody have her
[SPEAKER_10]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's in charge of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: She is her own.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a free agent.
[SPEAKER_10]: She grows on her own.
[SPEAKER_10]: None of these dispensaries own her.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have her plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't brag about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully granny's got a nice garden
of her own, but that's none of our
[SPEAKER_10]: business unless she wants to tell us.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know the first thing about
growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a very good podcast that has
helped me with a lot of good tips.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what gave you the idea to become the
Davin granny?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I've always, I've always smoked.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've smoked long before it was legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this Davin thing was pretty new about,
what, maybe two years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the dispensary I was going to,
they kept saying, you need to try this.
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to try this.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, y'all are young boys with slept back
hats.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to try this.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an old lady.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, then actually it was the owner of
the Canna Canyon, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Pete, they were like, come on,
try it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a high tolerance.
[SPEAKER_12]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I tried it, but I wasn't too big on it
because I didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then November, I got a portable email.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I tell that story?
[SPEAKER_10]: You can definitely tell any story you want
on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to shout out to DeBato up in
Denver because they're the ones that
[SPEAKER_12]: encouraged me to go in front of a camera
when I didn't know what the hell I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And do dabs and smile and talk.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I was like, but why should I do
it?
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, cause people will like
you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And people like me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why, but people like me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you can handle it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there's several things that
intrigue people, especially the normal
[SPEAKER_10]: people that aren't in Colorado taking dabs
and the people that don't get to dab and
[SPEAKER_10]: the people that when they do take dabs,
it's a P size and they get high as shit
[SPEAKER_10]: because they rarely get to dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're blown away by this old lady taking
a big old dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that's like my grandma taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now everybody wants to dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And everybody wants to dab with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess keep it quiet that you're
coming here because otherwise this place
[SPEAKER_10]: just fills up with people trying to meet
granny.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have learned, don't say where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually speaking to that in the August
issue of the Hub Connoisseur, I had the
[SPEAKER_03]: chance to do an interview with dab and
granny over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to talk about kind of how she
started with cannabis and exactly what you
[SPEAKER_03]: just talked about, kind of how she's
changing what it looks like to consume
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's changing what, you know,
changing what it looks like to use a
[SPEAKER_03]: blowtorch, to heat up the nail,
to take a big dab and to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it also changes what people's opinions
look like of, you know, what a high
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerance looks like, what actually
functioning on that high tolerance looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really just, you know,
a really cool thing to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of people are really
enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence her massive following.
[SPEAKER_10]: Massive following.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many Instagram followers do you have
now granny?
[SPEAKER_12]: I woke up this morning to 151.
[SPEAKER_12]: Only 151.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just hit 150 like two days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got, she got a thousand followers.
[SPEAKER_05]: She only got 151.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're telling me she only has 150.
[SPEAKER_05]: People.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fucking around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to add the K to the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have 151,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I tell you guys a funny story about a
grab lounge last night?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of my followers might not know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you just say 151, they might just
think, they don't understand.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I haven't even been on social media a
year.
[SPEAKER_10]: But last night, 151,000 followers in one
year, granny.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then look, I'm on Periscope,
Snapchat, talk and do just what we're
[SPEAKER_12]: doing here.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, the best thing about being
Deb and granny, this right here,
[SPEAKER_12]: look how many young people I have brought
together tonight and have exchanged a
[SPEAKER_12]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not all about getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_12]: Please don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we're giggling and stuff,
but no, lots of knowledge, education.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we might've heard you,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you guys are cool over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's so relaxed in this place.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's just on the couches,
just chilling.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the vibe in here right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some revolution playing in the
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hard not to after,
you know, two dozen days.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kicking it.
[SPEAKER_10]: God, granny, we cut you off on your story.
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I needed butane.
[SPEAKER_12]: What dabber doesn't need butane?
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to blast dabs, but for my torches.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was on Hancock and Delta and I seen
Rasta colors and it said hops crops gift
[SPEAKER_12]: shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: No red card needed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll sell butane, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: I walk in the door and there's somebody on
a couch and it's not the Canna Canyon
[SPEAKER_12]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more like dab lounge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Family joint kind of vibe, bar room kind
of vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: And a person on the couch goes,
you look familiar.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, yeah, I'm the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wasn't tooting my horn or anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I said, do you have butane?
[SPEAKER_12]: And the girl goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she was kind of attitude with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she said, if I turn you on to a dab,
can I record it?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_12]: So she's recording.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she goes, she says she's famous.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope it was worth the wait.
[SPEAKER_12]: She dabs me, doesn't carve it and lifts
the damn joint off the pipe.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just go, peace.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not supposed to carve a nail.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you just lift the drop down right off
the nail, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't like me there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: She says she's famous.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, well, I didn't say I was famous.
[SPEAKER_12]: I said I was the dabbing granny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rude people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be rude to people, especially the
dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's the dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's the sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, then somebody made a comment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Granny, don't go there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody was just killed in the parking
lot there last week.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, then.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody has been killed here.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: How can you hate on a sweet lady who
brings a bad basket of awesome treats
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere she comes with her?
[SPEAKER_10]: She's got a basket of snacks over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only does she bring a basket of turfs,
she literally brings a basket of all candy
[SPEAKER_06]: greatness you could possibly think of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, there's candy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Granny said there's always candy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is granny's basket right there of
goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: She brought a basket of snacks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those were hard words for my brain to make
happen, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basket of snacks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good on a lollipop.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you though.
[SPEAKER_10]: You confused him.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really are my granny.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll eat some sugar, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take one.
[SPEAKER_12]: How nostalgic are sugar babies?
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Lindsay for bringing people
snacks and being awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to granny for bringing a basket
of snacks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I've ever eaten a sugar
baby, but I'm going to try them because I
[SPEAKER_10]: need some sugar, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Chris for getting me this
shirt, actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chris has good taste.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, obviously.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lindsay's blushing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I never get to see Lindsay blush.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think she's blushing because of what I
said and no one else caught.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really wanted to blush that day
in the car with the- All right,
[SPEAKER_10]: we're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got Dan and granny here on the
podcast with us.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeff is blushing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeff is as red as his beard.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to watch him do that back.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good one, trolling Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's turn this around.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these sugar babies, these are babies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe what's going on here,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so excited right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you shouldn't eat these while you try
to talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't chew with those in your face at
all.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to let him try to chew these
real quick while I stare down at Jeff and
[SPEAKER_05]: want to know what this whole conversation
is about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know Lindsay over there is
giggling like no other.
[SPEAKER_10]: The conversation that happened in the car?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, inside joke.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the car.
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens in the car stays in the car.
[SPEAKER_10]: My car has now became Vegas.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to name my car Vegas.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to name my car Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was honestly just trying to make you
blush back just because- We did experience
[SPEAKER_10]: one thing in the car though.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like it when the person in the
seat behind me tries to use a dab torch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I've got four foot long dreadlocks
and that freaked me the fuck out
[SPEAKER_10]: completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also that's funny because then on
the last podcast when someone was sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: behind me on the couch and they were using
a torch and I looked at you and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, okay, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like, oh, I could just be a candle
in a minute here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, where are my dreads down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there one of them loose?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have all of them still?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't smell burning hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we have three dreads,
two, three non-dreads right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Camille's over there, so that's cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Camille's over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're overgrown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Team dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Team dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Might have to convert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might have to convert.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny, what are you doing right now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like to explain what's happening
to us?
[SPEAKER_12]: Sam, will you hold the mic to her face so
that she can- I am turping up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have some viola.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know what it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's some viola shatter.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the other thing in your hand
though?
[SPEAKER_12]: And that comes from oil slick,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I got to know oil slick because
I admired this beautiful shatter paper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to my friends at oil slick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Josh and the entire oil
slick.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Josh's mustache.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're nice people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, so I got to know him because of
the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, so some viola, which needs to be
kicked up a notch.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not real flavorful.
[SPEAKER_12]: So our good friend, the turp pimp has some
Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to add some of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like my second or third favorite
right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so distinct.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of my favorite flowers to smoke,
but honestly, I don't enjoy the turps,
[SPEAKER_10]: oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: It hits my tongue.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's overpowering to my tongue.
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the combination you had last week
that you was- It was the Durban poison on
[SPEAKER_10]: some shatter.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what the shatter was,
but there's that licorice anise flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too overpowering within the turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: The flowers are amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the lemon G, the ghost train haze,
the OG Kush, the paradigms, the whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a berry with Zanberry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that almost.
[SPEAKER_10]: Zanberry is out of control.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the ones you brought last week,
the ones you brought to Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Loved every one of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Durban poison, my tongue doesn't agree
with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the Durban poison and then there's- I
think by the time this podcast comes out,
[SPEAKER_05]: I will have paired.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grilled blue number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it have happened to you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to go quickly so that Brett
can talk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to cut myself off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to get in there quick,
but I wanted to say first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to go in there first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But shout out to Secret Sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's why I'm kind of having issues
over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, which one do I talk into?
[SPEAKER_10]: So Granny is now taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's got a healthy size dab there.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's got to be- Shout out to my baby,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's .2, .25.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're going to drop the turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's got a little- Are you just going to
pour it on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm impressed.
Just ballsy.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's got a little, a small dram vial,
like a quarter dram vial of turpines.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he just poured the turps directly onto
the dab and he nailed it like a freaking
[SPEAKER_10]: Olympian.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a beautiful- He would get a dab in
the dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to bring the clear Durban
poison.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not mad at you for anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't hate me.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's never hate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not my flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Granny grabbed the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing is milking.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's capping it.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's like a champion over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: What?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is when you need the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have saw that cloud that just
came out of her mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should have just heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was out of her face.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shakes her head.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It points at her nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, no, that didn't go out of my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out right out of my nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people would be coughing by now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that would have burned my
nose.
[SPEAKER_10]: She said she has tears in her eyes.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yum.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tears of yum.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, tears of yum.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tears of turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Turp tears.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hashtag turp tears.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that might be a new one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Turp tears.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was probably like a point three dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to ask Granny how long she's been
consuming cannabis as soon as she quits
[SPEAKER_10]: choking on this mini dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since she was 14.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did she say 14?
[SPEAKER_10]: But keep in mind that podcast never
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm telling you since she was 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know that actually.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lindsay is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: A freshman in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Granny trivia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how some of my giveaways are.
[SPEAKER_12]: Trivia like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: When did I?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we actually just had that
conversation when you were at the shop
[SPEAKER_02]: last.
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was.
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I met another nice glass blower.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's shout him out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Bojangos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That dude deserves a shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Logan and Cody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cloudy glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do a lot of periscopes.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you follow them on Periscope,
you'll see them blowing some glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those guys on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually depend on their Periscope to
sell their artwork.
[SPEAKER_12]: So give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure Granny makes a decent income off
of the social media, whether it be glass
[SPEAKER_10]: or clothing or whatever is sent to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you get a nice mailbox full of
stuff every month.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Lindsay, I know you do a whole bunch
of social media stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Chris and I met through social media.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how everything happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I became friends with Bobo
Blasterco.
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, I used to sit on the podcast and
he said you would giggle.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'm Periscope.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brett, I'm pretty sure we became friends
on social media before we ever met.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I haven't found you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've loved the podcast level you've been
putting out for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: But social media brought us all together.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, Brett, I'm going to shout Brett
out for being such a kind, loving person
[SPEAKER_12]: in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I jumped on the scene back in
November, I didn't know what the hell I
[SPEAKER_12]: was doing and none of you.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, most people were like,
where the hell did this woman come from?
[SPEAKER_12]: I still have this note that Brett wrote me
with one of his first slaps, as the people
[SPEAKER_12]: call them, because you slap them up on
everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: His light bulb, Mary's motivation that
just encouraged me to keep being positive
[SPEAKER_12]: and silly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you, Brett, just for kind of
saying, you know, stick with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I took a picture because I don't think
he believed that I really kept that letter
[SPEAKER_12]: for that long.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I love Brett so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is how positive and just happy
you always are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like every time I see you,
you're never upset.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, all right, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say, here's Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know, like so positive all the
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: His Instagram displays exactly that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys follow, is it Mary's underscore
motivation or Mary's motivation?
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary's underscore motivation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Follow Mary's underscore motivation on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check him out in the morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: He takes a morning dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: He does a silly dance.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a dog.
[SPEAKER_12]: He can do handstand dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just, I was just about to say to
you, listen, I tried three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't have a rig that will like
yours right to your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, I'm never going to be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a rig that's, it was just
perfect height.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I hate you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have tried the rig many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did it, I was just looking at,
I was stoned looking at the rig and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, how can I take a funny day?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked at my Bob Marley poster on
the wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a tapestry on the wall and I'm
like, well, my rig kind of curves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I could do a headstand and it'll
reach right in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and honestly, a first try.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, honestly tried my first try
and it worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised as fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what happens when you think outside
the box and take too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have tried Brett.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to lie, but my ass will not
pop up over my head.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I asked Grumpy Grandpa, will you give
me a lift?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he said, you are not one of those 25
year old kids.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I will not.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will not help you do a handstand dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I help you do a handstand dab before
we leave tonight?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we put some couch cushions down?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we sign some waivers to where Rasta
Jeff was just filming as my only
[SPEAKER_10]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dab stand.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dab stand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to see it, but I'm afraid to
see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to, there's, I want to back up
on two things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grumpy Grandpa?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I'll tell you when I first started
doing dab and granny, I have to blow my
[SPEAKER_12]: nose, dab, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll talk for a second.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in love with the Grumpy Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was like, have fun, but I don't want to
be on the camera.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I respected that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, well, what do you want
people to know you as?
[SPEAKER_12]: And he is like, well, just, just call me
Grumpy Grandpa.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, okay, that it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: On a scale of one to 10, how grumpy is
Grandpa?
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, actually because he has such chronic
pain and chronic illness, some days he's
[SPEAKER_12]: pretty grumpy.
[SPEAKER_12]: But considering I've been with him since
1974 and he still makes me laugh every
[SPEAKER_12]: day, he's not that grumpy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true love.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is love.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's longer than I've been alive,
granny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: He is, he is my life partner.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and it's good things and bad
things as every relationship is,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that he watched out for you and
didn't let you do a handstand.
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't, he did not want to call 911 for
his love today.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was like, no, you're not going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want to.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get it done.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just make it look like an upside
down dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got editing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got iMovie.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll make something happen for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what state did you live in when you
started consuming cannabis at the age of
[SPEAKER_10]: 14?
[SPEAKER_12]: I am an Iowa corn whore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that might be better than Terp
slut somehow.
[SPEAKER_12]: A corn whore and a Terp slut.
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens in the corn field stays in
the corn field.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is the first time I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Brad knows.
[SPEAKER_12]: Brad is from Illinois.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens in the corn field stays in
the corn field.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard that in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been to a corn field.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have hockey in Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hockey doesn't exist, Brett.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hockey exists everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go Blackhawks.
[SPEAKER_10]: The look on his face.
[SPEAKER_10]: You say hockey doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_10]: How hard was it for you to get some
cannabis when you lived in the corn?
[SPEAKER_10]: Was where they just growing cannabis up in
the corn also?
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I started meeting guys coming
back from the Vietnam war.
[SPEAKER_10]: You told us about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where it all started.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was exposed to first cannabis and then
many other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Slowly progressed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point in my life, I can truly say
with life experience, don't mess with that
[SPEAKER_12]: other shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, okay, you young folks say you need
your spiritual experiences with
[SPEAKER_12]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_12]: I respect that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as like meth and stuff,
oh, man, that's poison.
[SPEAKER_12]: Stay away from that crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything that anybody has to make,
stay away from that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that sounds controversial.
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds contradictory because we smoke
turps, but we're extracting something from
[SPEAKER_10]: grown.
[SPEAKER_10]: The meth, you got to put it together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brett, is this just yoga time suddenly?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got loose enough for them dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing some bridges and then we're going to
do some big dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the way you roll, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's prepping for an upside downer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The yoga dabs over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny meets these handsome young men
coming back from Vietnam and started
[SPEAKER_10]: smoking cannabis in Iowa out in the corn,
raising hell, being a youngster.
[SPEAKER_10]: When did you move to Colorado?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've lived here 24 years now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so you were here before the cannabis
revolution.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: But did I smoke cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, far before the revolution.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_12]: I lived in Europe before I came here.
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't have cannabis, but they had
hashish.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plenty of hashish in Europe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't smoke a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they didn't have a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, this has been a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm telling things, I'm telling
secrets, but I would every now and again,
[SPEAKER_12]: get my hands on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh boy, did the Europeans love American
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I always, I just have always found
people that consume.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like-minded folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: We like to, you can always find it's like
we, if you get a new job, if you go to a
[SPEAKER_10]: new school, if you move to a new town,
if you go to a new whatever, if you join,
[SPEAKER_10]: if you're into archery, when you go to
that new archery class, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_10]: if you're a glassblower, you walk in,
if you're a glassblower, everyone smokes,
[SPEAKER_10]: bad example.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you walk into most places,
you can look around the room and be like,
[SPEAKER_10]: ah, that dude over there, he's a turpore
just like me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go hang out and kind of feel
the waters out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when it's a break time, like,
so you want to go fucking get some 420 on?
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can always just find the
like-minded potheads in the group.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just because we put a vibe out word.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a few haters in the community,
but you know, that's like, every,
[SPEAKER_12]: every sect of life, you're going to have a
few bad people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for the most part, the people in the
cannabis community are happy people.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're loving people.
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to help each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to help other human beings.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we love the earth.
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to respect it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're all pretty like-minded.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all connected in that one way.
[SPEAKER_10]: We, if we don't love it, if we don't take
care of the earth, we can't grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis makes us more peaceful.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes us more connected.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes us easier to love each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: You ever taken a big dab and been like,
fuck that person.
[SPEAKER_10]: You take a big dab and you're like,
nah, it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're never angry as you're blowing out a
dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm never angry because you know,
this is, think about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can be angry at somebody and know it's
ugly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I heard that.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you popping over there,
bro?
That's weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just keep moving.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause this is getting weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, you're so angry at your
neighbor or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an anger is a pretty ugly emotion.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does your neighbor know that it's eating
you up?
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_10]: So who's it hurting?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's renting space in your head for free.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It isn't worth it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let it go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go talk to him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny, you're awesome to have on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like some of the stuff you say.
[SPEAKER_10]: You said a second ago that you're telling
your dark secrets.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's something that you've never shared
with anybody that you want to tell us here
[SPEAKER_10]: on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to put you on the spot like that
because I want to know what you're going
[SPEAKER_10]: to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: She just did the hand on the chin thing
and looked up at the sky.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this lady.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say that I, obviously I've done a
lot in my life and I've, I have no
[SPEAKER_12]: criminal record.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm still alive and that amazes me when I
think back at some of the things I've
[SPEAKER_12]: done.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm destined, I'm destined to be here
right now as Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all destined to be right here,
right at this moment.
[SPEAKER_10]: So my favorite friends, even Sam,
the new guy, bro, I like your vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like what you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to hang out more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've been going for almost an hour.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to do that thing where we talk
about everybody's social media connections
[SPEAKER_10]: and I thank everybody for coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dab and Granny, tell everybody how
everybody can find you on all the social
[SPEAKER_10]: media.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let them know about the YouTube,
Facebook, Instagram, everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I'm dabbing underscore granny.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on Instagram, dabbing underscore
granny, Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on Facebook and I'm kind of liking
this live streaming on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: You do great Facebook live videos.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just started doing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a lot of followers yet and
they, it's only a few people and they like
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably take a dab on Facebook live as
the end of this recording wraps up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do it together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and obviously because I am the Dab
and Granny, I consume a large amount of
[SPEAKER_12]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to have a few sponsors,
so I'm going to shout them out if that's
[SPEAKER_12]: okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was going to be the next thing I did.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_12]: First ones are Dubado.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know they take a lot of grief about
their product, but as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: concerned, there's many of those portable
emails out there branded under many names.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any one of those companies could have come
and said, Hey, we like you.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to help you.
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dubado did.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Dubado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooze 420.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have pens.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have silicone things.
[SPEAKER_11]: They make exit bags, which you have to
have at every dispensary here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'm going to be repping Megatoke,
which is smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is going to be smoking flour,
which is kind of different for me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So be watching for me.
[SPEAKER_11]: For me to be doing some more Megatokes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Megatokes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny, how much hash do you smoke in one
day on average?
[SPEAKER_10]: About four to five grams.
[SPEAKER_10]: Four to five grams of good quality shatter
or live resin every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_10]: She keeps up with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: If she doesn't outdo me, my budget can't
keep up with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, I told you in Nevada, here I come.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she means Nevada Avenue.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys could find her up near Cimarron.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I have to have a few sponsors.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know people are like, well, you
shouldn't do that, but I have to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that this community is willing to
sponsor each other and help each other
[SPEAKER_10]: out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes the wheels go round.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to having you on future
episodes because I love your vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to have your own show.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear that may be a possibility in the
future.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to encourage that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm being told not to talk too much about
it, but you need your own damn show.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've said that before.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need a show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to hang on, do some tabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do a Facebook live
together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam, thanks for joining me, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's these guys' first podcast,
too, kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.5.
[SPEAKER_10]: 1.5.
[SPEAKER_10]: First one was a practice run.
[SPEAKER_10]: Remind everybody where they can find you
on social media and then tell us about the
[SPEAKER_10]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me personally, it's at THC underscore
Samuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the magazine is at The Hemp
Connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check them out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you follow The Hemp Connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great magazine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well-made, well-printed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brett, it's time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grab the mic, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, this is the white turp pimp.
[SPEAKER_12]: What?
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, he's got a hat with a feather in
it.
Coming at you live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming at you live.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the Canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Down here with Rochester Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the turps.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've always wanted to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have, actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been creating this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, so I'm going to throw this
out there right now, because I've never
[SPEAKER_05]: said this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these people on the podcast
are going to fucking laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: But dude, I've actually seen you before.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like go way back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is before we even met.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's intimidating.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like a 6'6 dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: 6'5, like 96'6 with the hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting with the hat, with the dreads.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get a little tall, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you actually know what he does
and who he is, he can be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually saw him at, it was some
cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had to be, I think, champs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw you and I was like, is that that
dude, Rochester Jeff, that I have followed
[SPEAKER_05]: his genetics and shit for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I couldn't even say what's up,
because I didn't even know what to talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about and even how to approach you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, like, look at me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so appreciative that you have asked
me to be on your show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you have no idea this is a dream come
true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Brett, at the end of the day, didn't this
teach you that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Every one of us were all alike.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all people, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the funny thing, because I've
had actually people come up to me and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, I've seen you in a session a couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to say hi, but I didn't know
what to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been the same place, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first off, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the admiration and the
respect.
[SPEAKER_10]: I completely appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's returned.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bro, you are a lab manager for a
well-known lab that makes one of my
[SPEAKER_10]: favorite products.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, yeah, you guys are breaking,
breaking ground every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get you guys on again to do
an in-depth episode about terpenes,
[SPEAKER_10]: how terps are made.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the perfect person.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go in depth.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get you guys more terp
nerds on here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Real knowledge thing, not a sit-around,
like I said, PhD doctors.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do it here again, but I mean,
we're going to get terpy on that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just going to go real nerd-like so
that only a few people even understand the
[SPEAKER_10]: terminology, because those are some
people's favorite episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those used to be mine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our audience gets divided by the folks
that love the sit-arounds and the folks
[SPEAKER_10]: that love the science and the folks that
love the grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's kind of some divides, but I love
it all, so I do it all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brett, thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I look forward to doing more podcasts with
you and you both.
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot wait.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for being a fan boy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, if you see me in an event,
and I'm pretty sure I can speak for
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody at this table, we're just
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: We get thirsty when we wake up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to pee in the morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: We like to take dabs around six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want some food.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where does normal people walk up and say
hi?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do not say hi to me and you know
who I am, I will be very upset because I
[SPEAKER_05]: know eventually I will say what's up to
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you say the same thing I've said and
you've heard this and you say this thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yo, bro, I've told you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause this is me talking to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are shy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, let's dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brett's obviously not that shy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that I am six five and I've got
dreadlocks down to almost my knees.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that I could be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually got three or four people hanging
out with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're so well known in the industry
and you know what you're doing and you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to learn from you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you hear that deep radio voice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, what is behind that voice?
[SPEAKER_10]: Come say hello and I'll be your friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can hang out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can take some selfies now.
[SPEAKER_12]: One nine hundred Rasta Jeff podcast voice.
[SPEAKER_10]: One nine hundred Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do that, please.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I said that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But he has that kind of voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, this is this smooth
Barry Manilow podcast voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barry Manilow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he turns on.
[SPEAKER_12]: He turns it on.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got the captain and Tenille over
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Muskrat love.
[SPEAKER_12]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_12]: What did that guy ask?
[SPEAKER_12]: Were we going to do squash smash?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, somebody on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: I posted this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Squash.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we were in Jersey, it could be that you
can squash and squash later.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I posted to Facebook that I was setting
up to record a podcast with Davin Graney
[SPEAKER_10]: and someone on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first comment was you all going to
smash after.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's like, what's smash?
[SPEAKER_10]: I know now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we do, there will be video.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll post it to Facebook and you guys
will get to check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook Live right after the show.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't sign up for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think anyone in the room signed up
for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I didn't get paid enough for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your grandpa is going to be upset.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Chris, you got a microphone in
your hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell everybody your Instagram and or
Snapchat and or social medias.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then also tell us a whole bunch about
furniture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, I'm Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_06]: B.O.
[SPEAKER_06]: B.O.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_06]: You find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: My Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know my Snapchat now,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might have it listed on my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't I don't like it on social media.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I was going to use that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find me that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want some of your furniture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the furniture, the furniture is I have
a whole bunch of sweet little furniture
[SPEAKER_06]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a whole bunch of products that are
available on burniture.bigcartel.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically I make coffee tables and
tables.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have shelves that with basically emails
built into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't have to have a clumsy little
pod or cluster.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to work on a deal after this
because I need one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why he is not all over social
media.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rasta Jeff, he's too busy building quality
furniture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: How long ago did you give me my table?
[SPEAKER_06]: That was over a year ago now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we were just talking about the
other day on another podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it still works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still jamming.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like an original, original one
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: The paint's kind of beat up, but I mean,
you know, that means it's been used.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just a decoration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's that was what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm happy I sent it to him
because that's what I sent it over to him
[SPEAKER_06]: for was to really get that that work into
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of my first original ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the OG burniture table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who really do I know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've seen who like really just dabs
and Rasta Jeff's that guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great table.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I fully endorse burniture tables.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're in the Colorado Springs area,
we can get you locally.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're in Pueblo, we can get you
locally.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can probably get you taken care of in
Denver too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll figure it out and get you a
burniture table.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, we'll ship them to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like, also I do like custom stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have stuff on like ideas you want
to come to me, like, yeah, you want pellet
[SPEAKER_06]: cases, you want game consoles,
anything you have, like random ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have kids that come to me like,
Hey, put this in a shoe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably put it in a shoe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a pair of shoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could probably put it in a shoe.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have something like a portable
really on the go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just coming out of the dashboard.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that's highly illegal.
[SPEAKER_10]: I should not talk like that, but we were
making a joke for camping, for camping or
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor experiences.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or when you're stuck in traffic between
Denver and Springs for an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_10]: and you move 10 feet because there's a
wreck up there and nobody cares if you're
[SPEAKER_10]: taking a dab or not because you're not
going to drive for an hour anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't I take a dab, officer?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, yeah, you just definitely gave
white Mike a panic attack while he's
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so unfair of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is like, Oh my God, he's talking
about, Oh my, Oh my, Oh my, I need to take
[SPEAKER_02]: a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes the traffic is horrendous,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bubba, thanks for making the killer burn
at your table.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for joining us on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you always for the love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you always for letting me on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so great coming out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love meeting all you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam was awesome meeting you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was wonderful meeting you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is such a great, awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to be in Canyon Canyon and have
Canyon Canyon and stuff like this to be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to have and be able to meet so many
people at once.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Canyon is a great place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys in states that are passing legal
ization for medical, please keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_12]: do not go strictly wreck.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's people that really truly
need medical.
[SPEAKER_12]: Please keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: Secondly, remember you need places to
gather and consume.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have people that have leases that they
can't medicate in their own apartment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are they going to go?
[SPEAKER_12]: You need places like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have learned here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_12]: So listen to us.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're trying to help you.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not being arrogant.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just put some forethought in a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny is completely right.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Colorado, we messed up when we wrote
the bills here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We did not include consumption areas.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a gray area.
[SPEAKER_10]: These places can be shut down at any time.
[SPEAKER_10]: This Canyon Canyon where we are allowed to
sit here at this table and gather
[SPEAKER_10]: peacefully and take some dabs and have a
podcast together.
[SPEAKER_10]: This could be stopped at any moment with
just a letter.
[SPEAKER_10]: All that would have to be done is a letter
written and a judge says no more and it
[SPEAKER_10]: could be over.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you do get around to writing the
legalization bills in your state,
[SPEAKER_10]: make sure you include these types of
places.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you put so many of these places
available in so much locality and write
[SPEAKER_10]: rules for them because if you don't write
rules, when it comes to make rules for
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis legalization in your area,
the rules will be written for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they make the rules for you,
you get really fucked.
[SPEAKER_10]: They say, okay, nothing then.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you let them write the rules,
they don't give you shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you make the rules yourself,
you can have experienced people on there
[SPEAKER_10]: that understand what this community wants
and needs and it can be done
[SPEAKER_10]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I encourage you, be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you get the social clubs in the
legislation.
[SPEAKER_10]: When the time comes and the time is now,
start doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get your shit together.
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember people, knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got to keep this cannabis army on the
march.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because we're getting recreation
illegal in some places doesn't mean we can
[SPEAKER_10]: get lazy with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris, thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: The beautiful Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris's better half.
[SPEAKER_10]: The lovely red dreads.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like you cleaned up a little bit
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it a little buzz on there on the
sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to get a haircut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was getting bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take the little fillies off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like it better short like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: A little airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you lollipop your head a little.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lindsay, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure most of our listeners know how to
find you by now, but remind everybody all
[SPEAKER_10]: of your social media connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my Instagram is the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Snapchat is traveling stoner without
the G.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Twitter is the travel stoner and my
Periscope is the traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_10]: You are one traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any brands you need to shout
out or anybody that is sponsoring you that
[SPEAKER_10]: you need to support while you're on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another shout out to Starfire Edibles for
sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nom, nom, nom, nom.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Jazz is just the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak highly enough of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dank Essence CBD infused bath bombs as
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bath bombs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a reason for a dude to use a bath
bomb?
[SPEAKER_12]: You might like them actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a product test them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't, don't judge a guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you make one of the videos like all
the girls do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you meant of Dank Essence
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, I gave some to my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dank Essence?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Dank Essence of another bath bomb
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And girls love them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think actually I've tried many of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do like Dank Essence because they are
high in CBDs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to me, okay, because the grumpy
grandpa is sick, I got to do yard work and
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes I hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relaxing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Old school, I used to just soak with some
Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I use these bath bombs and they work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Young men of Colorado Springs,
you dab dudes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're sitting on the couch on a fucking
Saturday, taking dabs, watching Dab and
[SPEAKER_10]: Granny do videos.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go do her yard work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go mow her lawn for her.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go pick up the trash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go pick up the leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just hit her up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: Say Dab and Granny, I'm going to come
clean your front lawn because Ross and
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeff said so and I'm a respectful young
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no need for you to be out there
cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're too awesome to be out there
cleaning shit up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some young man.
[SPEAKER_10]: You ain't doing shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get up off the couch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go help out the Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then after that, go help out someone
else's granny and clean up some fucking
[SPEAKER_10]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Clean up their yard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Help somebody out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I always end my YouTubes every
morning by saying, make the best day you
[SPEAKER_12]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do your own personal best and always try
and do a kind deed for somebody because
[SPEAKER_12]: you'll feel good at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see no reason to not end this podcast on
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone else is kind of like Fox.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man, Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fox just called in on FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody put your mic up to him.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't hear him from here.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I want to meet you so bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to talk, you and I, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fox just happens to call right as we're
recording.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kabuki, you gave me a gift the other day
and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: He threw me a peace sign and said I'm
welcome at any time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great that you called us.
[SPEAKER_12]: He is great with the CBDs I always talk
about.
[SPEAKER_12]: I see his Instagram pictures and I
salivate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, I love each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for joining me on the podcast.
