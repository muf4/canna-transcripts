[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, across the table

[SPEAKER_02]: Dwight Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing today, Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's a nice, sunshiny day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking warm out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just took some dabs and then Mike had
to go have a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were watching the clouds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took so many dabs, I saw a dragon in the
clouds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were starting to see stuff in the
clouds and thought, you know what,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're in the right headspace to hit
record.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to start the show off by talking
about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took some dabs of copper chem,
full spectrum extract from our friends at
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is tremendously tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a cross of chem four and
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: The aroma and flavors are described as
described.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a hard time with words lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavors are described as guava juice
and watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would give the watermelon absolutely a
thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I know what guava juice
smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also a hint of gassy stuff
going on in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the gassy in the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, gassy watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The label says 67.9% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do approve of the buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I saw a fucking dragon in the
clouds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good concentrate, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Green Dot Boys.

[SPEAKER_02]: I am stumbling with my face today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got through the requires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the date?
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to look at my phone and see the
actual real date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is Friday, September 20th.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I woke up today, I was oddly excited
to check my newsfeed and to see what was
[SPEAKER_02]: going on in the world because today is the
start of the raid on Area 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot we can talk about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go too long on this
because it's such a beautiful story,
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a raid on Area 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk briefly about Area 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do any research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe possibly some aliens crashed in
Roswell, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to fucking go down that
path.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask Eddie Bravo about that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe some aliens crashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a museum and also a base made
based on this discovery, this findings of
[SPEAKER_02]: these alien parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Area 51 is where the spacecraft and all
the shit was taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crime scene was moved to Area 51.
[SPEAKER_03]: Capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that isn't the story, then none of
the other part adds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people think there are aliens
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've moved all the alien stuff,
the crafts, the bodies, all that shit is
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The iPhone was made there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just joking with that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So alien UFO crash, all the stuff gets
moved to Area 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: Area 51 is a real US military base.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real military installation and
research facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That absolutely is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much that people are there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fences, guards, gates, buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guns and dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one day, not so long ago, a guy who I
won't say his name went to the bar and had
[SPEAKER_02]: just the right amount of drinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The exact right number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of drinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's already kind of made history.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the right amount of fucking drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went home and he posted to a social
media platform that we should raid Area 51
[SPEAKER_02]: and clap some alien butt cheeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we all show up at once, they can't stop
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same theory behind like hemp
fest.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe slightly different, but yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If a hundred thousand people show up to do
one, do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's almost nothing that
authorities can do to stop that thing from
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except this is a military base.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet there's shit they can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have ways of stopping this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy goes online and he decides that
he wants to clap some alien butt cheeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like Mike said, if I think he said a
million people, if we can get a million
[SPEAKER_02]: people, they can't stop us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he started what was known as the
raid on Area 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was meant to be a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it started as just a funny little
internet joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude had a funny drunk thought on his
way to passing out and decided to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two more beers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would have gotten to Pornhub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four more beers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wouldn't have made it home from the
bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three less beers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he probably would have tried to watch
TV instead of Facebook that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of this shit would have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the right amount of it's fake beer
and burritos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it all came out just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this dude posts this post and it
actually caught on.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The social media network era that we live
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know what we're talking
about, get off and under that fucking rock
[SPEAKER_03]: you've been under.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been everywhere for months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today is the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, let's all gather up at Area 51
and raid Area 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually the government said,
Hey fuckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: This blew up fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the government came out right away and
said, by the way, folks, this is a real
[SPEAKER_03]: government installation with real rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you try to rush past the gates,
we really will use lethal force to stop
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went so far in their statement as to
saying, we don't have rubber bullets here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shoot you with live ammo and you die.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't use crowd control toys to keep
people from rushing under military
[SPEAKER_03]: installations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's military.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a civilian control thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have said raid and attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will defend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't fuck around at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will put holes in you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what they've got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is real, really the alien storage,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck do they have there to
protect that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have a button that they go
doink.
[SPEAKER_03]: At minimum, they've got lots of big guns
and a whole lot of like medium sized guns.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've seen in the press, the dogs that
I've seen are enough to keep me the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: out of there, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one dog that they showed in the video,
the popular one, weighs as much as me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dog weighs as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dog can run, tackle, destroy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told Mike I'd rather get shot eight or
six times by that fucking gun than take
[SPEAKER_02]: one good lashing from that dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you shoot me with that gun,
I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dog's just going to chew me up and
I'm going to cry for a few minutes and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to need stitches and I'm going to
bleed and I'm going to be fucking mangled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fucking shoot me, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's try to get my high ass a
little bit back on track here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all gathered up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government knew we were coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's like 1,500 people is what I
was reading in the two little towns
[SPEAKER_03]: closest to Area 51 and like 150 or 200
people have made their way down the little
[SPEAKER_03]: dirt ass back roads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another side thing we should
touch on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy finally realized after the
government came out and said, we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went, oh yeah, maybe we shouldn't do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he decided to be a capitalist in a
modern day world and turn his prank into a
[SPEAKER_02]: profitable business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he tried to create a festival out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually tried to turn it into a music
festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, he was just a drunk dude
that posted some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had no ability to throw a festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you build it, sometimes they don't
come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want to, he did not want to fire
everybody up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get my fire pun.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want to fire everybody up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he did not do his fire festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, but some other people took
it upon themselves to do small local
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 5% of Burning Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bunch of, uh, yeah, that basically
it looks like a bunch of small fish
[SPEAKER_02]: concerts, parking lots happening,
little mini Burning Man's and everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: got all their alien gear on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's got blow up alien dolls they're
dancing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just all alien to the fuck out or all
these places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows what the plan is.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these people are, yeah, we're here to
raid area 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, so what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to cross that gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original internet joke was they were
going to rush the buildings at like three
[SPEAKER_03]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll wake up tomorrow to either mass
casualties as morons rush area 51 or yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't do anything other than get a
tan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bunch of trip and hippies get tickets for
illegal possession.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw one guy has already been arrested
for peeing near the gate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so far at this point, don't pee
towards soldiers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will get you arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about, uh, three o'clock in the
morning, people started showing up and
[SPEAKER_02]: gathering around the gate and they were
greeted by armed guards were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we know you're coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't cross this line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy started recording and politely
asked one of the guards with the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm watching on a YouTube live video like
three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, sir, I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know what happens if I
cross the line and the guys weren't like a
[SPEAKER_02]: ninja mask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he's a federal agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's all covered up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He removed the mask just far enough to see
his mouth clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he smiled and he said, I get to
release my dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he put his mask up and it wasn't like
a, sir, I will be forced to release my
[SPEAKER_02]: animal, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be forced to detain you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to let my dog eat you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was kind of excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, cross the line, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had really liked to let this dog go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't train those guys to hand out
hugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, no, they're not there to be gentle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's one dude in every group
that's trying to get first aid,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the rest of them are trying to tear
shit into little itty bitty pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if I told, if I told just about any
adult male, your job now is to protect the
[SPEAKER_02]: perimeter of this with your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most guys take that as like a fun
assignment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something in you that is like,
I'm protective now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm primal.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my property.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing about guard duty is it's 99.9%
wishing shit would happen because your
[SPEAKER_03]: skull fucked board.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guards that I saw, the guards,
which I saw in the video were very polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were actually friendly and
interacting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, there were different,
you can tell, you can tell there were
[SPEAKER_02]: different levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure there's a whole bunch of
extra people on duty.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gotta be a percentage of them that
are just livid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got to be pulling fucking middle
of the night guard duty cause morons on
[SPEAKER_03]: the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny you said that the one kid in the,
the interviewee said, sir, what would you
[SPEAKER_02]: rather be doing right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, I would have gotten off work
about 15 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be getting home to eat dinner and
go to bed, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, Oh, sorry to keep you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was like four or five agents,
whatever, in this group, two of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: talkative.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other two stood there like,
we don't talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, we're just looking,
you guys talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reality is that people are idiots and
there's a perfectly reasonable chance that
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight, a bunch of people get drunk and
like six of them are like, they can throw
[SPEAKER_03]: my doll and go fucking tequila running at
the gate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, the dude who was chummy and
talking to people this morning might have
[SPEAKER_03]: to kill like eight idiots tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you never fucking know when you're that
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when he goes for eight,
I think once he crosses like the four to
[SPEAKER_02]: five, maybe six threshold, I think it's
just happy fire after that, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he just turned it into the end of
fucking true romance at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you don't, you don't have an
assault rifle and you didn't just cross
[SPEAKER_02]: the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there might be something in that
man's head that might just accidentally
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all coming at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, everybody looks like to come in at
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start firing, it's like,
once you got a hammer, everything looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like a nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that guy may just enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so far nothing has happened,
but yeah, like I hope nothing happens
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no faith tonight could be the
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight could be the night that a bunch of
stupid people scratch themselves out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of people from all across the
country, possibly the world who have never
[SPEAKER_02]: been to the desert where it was fucking
like 30 degrees last night and it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be 104 today and they're partying and
they're not prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be nodding their right
fucking minds and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: bored and restless by the end of tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some shit could go down by sunrise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sick part of me is excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good wholesome part of me is like,
Oh, nothing goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go either way, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to report good news and I like to
see shit happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, my kid ain't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, we have some wonderful
memes because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the truth, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The past few months of just alien memes,
going to clap some alien butt cheeks have
[SPEAKER_02]: been some funny fucking memes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even drink and I laugh my ass off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is one good time in my life that
alcohol did some good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all fun and games to stupid people
running a gunfire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in my life, but this guy nailed
it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to all the people that made the
trek to area 51.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time, make a plan before you drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny to see everybody just showed up
and like, so we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we check in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is there a leader?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have like a leader and there's no
internet service out there so nobody can,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bunch of millennial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's honestly, if you and I went out there
and we didn't have service, we'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, now what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's the next step?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my phone doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I go to my phone to find my next
move and it's not available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a plenty of funny coming
down the pipe from this, as long as a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of people don't rush the gates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then an entirely different sort of
funny happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sick twisted part of me was going to
say, I don't know, Mike, that's when the
[SPEAKER_02]: funny really begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just nodded in silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on from the alien butt cheeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some real cannabis
related stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has to be a cannabis related story,
at least tangentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people out there smuggling weed,
smuggling some alien OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half those memes were inspired by
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The aliens brought us the weed,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's something that has been popping
up in the news again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been avoiding talking about this
subject because I am not a doctor,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a scientist, but I've done some
reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike brought this up and said,
we should talk about this on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a syndrome, a thing that is
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is known and I'm going to pronounce it
incorrectly, but that's okay because if
[SPEAKER_02]: you've never heard the word before,
it doesn't matter if I'm saying it wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it only matters that we're talking
about this and giving you the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it said a couple of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about a syndrome
called cannabis hyper emesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also heard it pronounced cannabis
hyper emesis syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you want to say we're going to
call it CHS for this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get much less criticism.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a syndrome that is being labeled
CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is popping up all over the country,
but most commonly in places where we have
[SPEAKER_02]: done some sort of cannabis
decriminalization and made cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: available to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe part of that, we're going to get
into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not so much localized around
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that's where you read about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the people there can say they
consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in any place that's legalized,
it's invoked to blame every problem you
[SPEAKER_03]: stumble across on legal weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lazy docs is my third note.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's also we can say,
yeah, we do smoke a lot of weed here
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can't say that if you live in
some other place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and then also doctors are lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, you got dreadlocks and smoke a
lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the symptoms, a lot of times the
symptoms include a very crampy stomach and
[SPEAKER_02]: nausea and vomiting and muscle tension and
a headache and a burning sensation in your
[SPEAKER_02]: skin or in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are other random symptoms that
some patients do report and some patients
[SPEAKER_02]: do not report.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people feel itchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people feel like their skin is
crawly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main complaints are stomach
problems and a stomach cramps,
[SPEAKER_03]: nausea, repeated bouts of vomiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the kicker that the doctors are
looking for is if the symptoms are
[SPEAKER_03]: relieved or abated with hot showers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason it gives you the urge to
take a hot shower and the hot showers will
[SPEAKER_02]: help it, which is really weird because one
of my favorite things, I just go randomly
[SPEAKER_02]: take a hot shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done that since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, huh, this is strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came across that because like when
you're writhing in agony or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: your mind starts going through the
Rolodex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh fuck, how do we get this to stop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that people have
reported that works is hot showers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're doing a couple of different
things to treat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing something with capsaicin and
mainly it's just hydrate you and tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: to lay off whatever you've been smoking
until the symptoms abate is all anybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not like a drug that they found
that makes it better or anything like that
[SPEAKER_03]: that they can give you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just you have to stop consuming
cannabis and in hydrate and just give it
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as what ever is in your system passes,
they're blaming THC right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I really highly doubt that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my next note.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I forgot what I was going to say on
it because I told you to pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was it Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's up with the syndrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not familiar with it,
you can look CHS up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about it right now because
Jeff said, what do you want to do a show
[SPEAKER_03]: about today?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, CHS is in the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll be able to find out more
specific information about it if you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are getting CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that have smoked for a long time
are suddenly developing CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like folks like myself who have smoked for
years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like 16 year old sneaks out of
house, smokes first joint with friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: comes home and has CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it could be that could occur as
well, but that's not as common.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's reporting that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're probably just thinking if
that does happen, they also just think I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: just too fucking high for my first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably what they attribute that
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it is popping up in folks that
smoke like myself and Mike's level,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a daily or a frequent or like a
regular consumer, somebody that smokes a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's popping up in random places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way to stop it for a short
time is these hot showers and then quit
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking and kind of clean out your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people report that it comes back
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say that it doesn't come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say that it will come back
later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of strange and kind of random
at that sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the next thing that we should be
that's part of the reason this has been so
[SPEAKER_03]: hard to to nail down and describe is a is
a specific illness or something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: being caused by whatever is because it's
it's characterized by the symptoms we've
[SPEAKER_03]: said.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to get a diagnosis, the people have to
go back to the E.R.
[SPEAKER_03]: over and over and over again with they
showed up because it kind of presents like
[SPEAKER_03]: extreme food poisoning and stomach cramps,
which is typically those symptoms are
[SPEAKER_03]: alleviated with hot showers, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not until you've come back to the E
.R.
[SPEAKER_03]: three or four times and they start asking
about your cannabis use that they decided
[SPEAKER_03]: to diagnose it as CHS and recommend
stopping all cannabis consumption to see
[SPEAKER_03]: what that does for for several weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think excuse that that was terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of that is a doctor
getting lazy and getting tired of seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: you and being like, we don't have a real
diagnosis for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be easy just to slap this CHS
label on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say you smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably what's doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think part of that is laziness.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really think is excuse my throat,
you guys, I apologize for that rude
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast or throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really think is the root cause of
CHS is honestly a pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think I've got worker protection
safety training from the department,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Colorado Department of Agriculture and
the Colorado State University of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am train the trainer certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am certified in going to anywhere that
uses pesticides, any sort of agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can train the staff on pesticide
handling and pesticide application and
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide safety on a professional
commercial horticulture level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I made my point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've read a lot about pesticides and what
happens when you're exposed to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the symptoms of CHS directly
match the symptoms of azadirachtin
[SPEAKER_02]: poisoning and azadirachtin exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very much the same symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're parallel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think how common is this product
used in cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of the most common pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I first started reading
about these cases, I thought, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not the THC because humans have been
using THC in concentrated forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you don't know the history of
cannabis and hash, you can look this shit
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before the 1920s, eating hash was
wildly popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a book called The Hash Eaters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even in the count of Monte Cristo
that eating hash is one of the subplots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's the odds that there's an
illness with symptoms this severe that's
[SPEAKER_03]: caused directly by THC or CBD or one of
the other cannabinoids is highly unlikely.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is extremely likely is that there's
something that's in common use like neem
[SPEAKER_03]: oil or something else that fucking
everybody uses at least for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neem oil is not super popular now,
but for a minute, everyone and their
[SPEAKER_03]: brother had neem in their fucking garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of other folks are attributing neem
oil to this syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think neem and azadirachtin are the
same, if not similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should read that before I say that,
but they're attached somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of people suspect,
or a lot of people in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: community's prime suspects is something
that we're adding to cannabis for one
[SPEAKER_03]: reason or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this ties in with the vaping story
that's going on right now too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a concerted effort by people in
the media and people in the anti-marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: world to pin the vaping stuff on THC or
vaping period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's clearly nonsense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's clearly an additive that's causing
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not focusing on that's going to cause this
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone in the community needs to be
aware that we're talking about stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that's being added to our cannabis,
not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say added.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to sound like it's being
added.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being sprayed, applied, fed to...
It's being sprayed as an intention as a
[SPEAKER_02]: pest preventative or a pest deterrent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's being applied too late or too
heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's being applied improperly is
basically what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a quick Google search.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two main active ingredients derived
from the neem tree seeds are azadirachtin
[SPEAKER_02]: and clarified hydrophobic extract of neem
oil, also referred to simply as neem oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, neem and azadirachtin are one in
the same, just an extract of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what the symptoms are coming
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I typed in the word azadirachtin,
the first thing that came up were
[SPEAKER_02]: poisoning symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look, it is very similar to
what we're looking at with CHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you asked if that is a product
that is used.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's used fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything with AZA at the start of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel bad mentioning the products,
but azadirachtin is made with
[SPEAKER_02]: azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of them, two of them, I'm thinking
quickly, I can think of at least three
[SPEAKER_02]: azadirachtin derived products that are
allowed by the Colorado Marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: Enforcement Division and the Colorado
Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to loop back to something I
was talking about a minute ago about
[SPEAKER_02]: improper pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is what is known as the re-entry
interval when you apply a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I spray, most products have a four or
an eight hour, most of the things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: would use have got a four or an eight hour
re-entry interval.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I spray that product in my garden,
I have to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unless you are in the proper
protective equipment, you should not enter
[SPEAKER_02]: that grow room for four to eight hours
because that pesticide is active in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you touch the plants, you risk getting
a pesticide contamination on your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is still in there, if it was sprayed
and micronized bubbles, you can still
[SPEAKER_02]: inhale that into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That re-entry interval needs to be
lengthened in our indoor grow environments
[SPEAKER_02]: because we don't have wind and we don't
have sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those pesticides are not getting broken
down by the natural environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just hanging out on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are spraying too often.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're spraying outside, shit drips
onto the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to absorb and diffuse into the
topsoil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun is going to break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun is going to destroy most of what
we're putting out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the rain is going to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside the drips gather like in the little
rain gutters and they just pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no absorption.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gathered up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we apply again and we apply again and
we apply again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where there is too much pesticide
gathered up on our flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about this also in a previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking plants that have been sprayed
a little bit too late and we're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: shit, man, this crap's got bugs on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been spraying it and I can't get rid
of the bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you make an executive decision around
week eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this can't go 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: These bugs are going to eat this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you know what else we got to do
with it because it came down early?
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn it into oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn it into oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also we just sprayed it four weeks
ago, three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also going to make concentrated
azadirachtin in my oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I can see it in some
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can identify the floaty pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you apply that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take down the crop a little bit early
because it wasn't a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got early flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to buy premature flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You turn it into concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just made concentrate with
contaminated flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're going to get cannabis hyper
emesis syndrome from consuming that
[SPEAKER_02]: azadirachtin laden concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is what's making people sick
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: The part of the, this whole topic that
drives me just up the wall is like when
[SPEAKER_03]: it's cantaloupe that's making people sick,
like seven, eight people get sick and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're like, it's Billy's cantaloupe farm
in like Billy, Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: They produced it and sold it and they
fucked up step seven and these people got
[SPEAKER_03]: sick and those families sue the company
and life goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like because it's a legal regulated
product that goes through standard testing
[SPEAKER_03]: and inspections.
[SPEAKER_03]: When stuff sold like that, they can track
it back right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when they had scares in the eighties
and the nineties where people fucking with
[SPEAKER_03]: Tylenol bottles and shit on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: When somebody would buy a bottle of
Tylenol that had been tampered with,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were immediately able to say that
bottle of Tylenol came from Billy's drug
[SPEAKER_03]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy's drug store got their shipment of
Tylenol from Timmy's warehouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Timmy's warehouse got their ship from
Tylenol factory 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to Tylenol factory 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: They talked to the 15 guys that were
working the day that bottle went through
[SPEAKER_03]: the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what legal and regulated means.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as cannabis moves, all the way into
that market, we're finally going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the protections that should have fucking
been there our whole lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on the, I've grabbed this
concentrate container here on the back of
[SPEAKER_02]: this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, I'm not going to read the
numbers exactly, but I've got an RMCF and
[SPEAKER_02]: RMIP and then a couple of other numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these numbers was the cultivation
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: The RMCF is the RM, the recreational
marijuana cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a number there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know where this was cultivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what, which grow these flowers came
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I've got an RMIP, a recreational
marijuana infused product facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of myself for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a number there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know who grew this and I knew who
extracted it with this RMCF number.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I wanted to, I could request their
pesticide application logs, which they're
[SPEAKER_02]: required to keep for a minimum of two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a problem occurred from this batch
of concentrate, I could tell you what was
[SPEAKER_02]: applied to their garden for the past two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were honest, they're supposed to
write all of that shit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trick there is just apply some shit
and don't write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we defeat that Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: More regs, inspections, more regs,
lab testing and inspections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the Colorado marijuana enforcement
division has a couple of new machines that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just loving to fucking use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They show up to your grow and they dress
up like their goddamn CSI and they go in
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow and they cut off a leaf from one
or two plants and they denote plant number
[SPEAKER_02]: six.
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers are way longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other plants are all tagged with a
specific number already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just write that number down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant number six, the bottom third main
branch of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took this leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put it in a little evidence bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a fucking crime bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take a few samples throughout the
entire grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just pick random places and
they'll take samples and they'll write it
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get all of the grower information,
the owner information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They check so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they take those samples back to a lab
and they test them for pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if those plants are tested for
improper pesticide application,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are repercussions for that garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire garden can be taken down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll send people down to watch you
shred your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll help you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll fucking help you shred those
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two people I know that have been
through that process, the guys they sent
[SPEAKER_03]: to watch everything get shredded were just
asking stupid questions the whole time,
[SPEAKER_03]: making it worse on the people that had to
shred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, the MED is a fun group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys at the MED.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we mean when we say legal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legal beer don't make people sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know the history of prohibition,
one of the really fucked up things that
[SPEAKER_03]: happened was a lot of the alcohol people
were drinking during prohibition was
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it poison?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the black market cares about
profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was part of the black market,
like tangentially, fundamentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why sometimes I try to stand up for
the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got compassion for the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the black market in some places,
there is no market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a hundred percent true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the cannabis community for so
long, we had no other option.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we made the best black market we
could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody trusts and respects their dealer
for the most part when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's necessarily true for
a lot of other harder drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of the smokers I know,
especially in the black market days,
[SPEAKER_03]: had a fun relationship with whoever their
guy was and always went back to that one
[SPEAKER_03]: spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've really carried some of that
through into the legal market where we
[SPEAKER_03]: pick a dispensary and we stay with that
chain or that outfit for as long as we
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before changing it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think some of that's making some of
these little epidemics worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CHS thing, if you're buying product
that's tainted with the pesticide from
[SPEAKER_03]: shop A, odds are strong that their whole
grow is treated with whatever's making you
[SPEAKER_03]: sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you move from flower to flower,
concentrate to concentrate, as long as
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going back and buying from that
specific store, whatever's in their supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain that's fucking with you is going to
keep fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now odds are pretty good that
it's something that the whole industry is
[SPEAKER_03]: using, legal and illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe strongly that the whole industry
is using Azadirachtin-based and Neem-based
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I can be such a strong testament to
your loyalty is what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you do find a shop or a weed guy,
you keep going there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at my table, there are two
brands all over the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I stick with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've never done me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit's always proper and I don't feel sick
from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are going to be a hundred people now
that get fucking paranoid from this
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this syndrome now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry we did that to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am really, really rough on my lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bong hits are my favorite method of
consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a reputation for coughing like
a fucking savage on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't even converted over to
concentrates, which if you haven't figured
[SPEAKER_03]: out that vaping concentrates is a lot less
wear and tear on your lungs than smoking a
[SPEAKER_03]: joint for the same amount of stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're just having been thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And still I prefer bong hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why it's just, it's too
perfect to give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've had vape pens where I take a
couple of puffs on it and I just feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: my lungs feel soggy or squishy for the
next hour, day and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I didn't mind losing those carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking terrible with carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I don't do them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the vape pen cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: You lose those too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a couple other people that are like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, I can keep on to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got seven batteries at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: No carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't finished a cart in like four
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but immediately I knew that that was a
product where an industry on the margins
[SPEAKER_03]: or an industry that squeezed as hard as
the legal cannabis industry is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot of the carts are where they're,
they're D minus and failed product ends up
[SPEAKER_03]: in, in a black market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who the fuck knows what's in those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're finding carts with, um,
K2 and spice, uh, in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are like, they found that shit
in CBD carts in fucking Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found K2 in the carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they found that shit in Massachusetts,
uh, mass too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, uh, just know if you're buying
black markets, stick the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look at flour, you can smell
flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see problems with the flour
through the bag and a quick transaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are ways that we've all learned to
protect ourselves buying flour in the
[SPEAKER_03]: black market, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're buying legit hash, you can,
you can look and see quality versus not
[SPEAKER_03]: quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it's in a cart, who the fuck knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be, that could be piss in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with the dispensaries, uh,
they are now, uh, before I get to the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary part, they're now doing
concentrate tests until recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it may have been September 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not have to test the
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just testing the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're also testing a sample of
the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the concentrate does happen to get
an abundance of pesticide concentrated,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll get noticed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're testing for that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that is happening to keep us
safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are doing random dispensary tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to dispensaries now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not buys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, uh, going in like health
department and checking the flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pulling flour out of the jar and
testing it for microbes and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, yeah, they're doing checks on the
actual flower that is in the jar on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf now because shit can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I know what can happen from the
row because it gets sealed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on how your grow is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably goes in a fucking Turkey bag
and it gets sealed up in a Turkey bag and
[SPEAKER_02]: driven in the back of Mike's car from the
grow facility to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody at the dispensary checks
it in and puts it into a different
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I don't know if it gets sealed
airtight.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it gets left open, I don't know what
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did somebody get washed from the last
batch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did somebody sneeze in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did somebody wash their hands after using
the shitter before they dumped that bag?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, if the shit we've seen or talking
about in the legal market has your ears
[SPEAKER_03]: perked up or your, your gag reflex kicking
in, just imagine the shit we've seen in
[SPEAKER_03]: the purely illegal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some dispensaries have a dry it and cure
it in the jar sort of a theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been asked to take my shoes off and
grind the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant material that was stuck to the
bottom of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it more sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they used to compress it is
they pour sugar water over it and put it
[SPEAKER_02]: in a trash compactor is how they used to
compress all the Mexican brick weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's endless nasty that we've just been
like, fuck, but it's that or no herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it is legalization takes hold.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can finally get away from some of this
shit, but it's, it's always a struggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always a struggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: This vape thing is really going to
fucking, everybody's going to take three
[SPEAKER_03]: steps back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully there are some people that will
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of people pushing that
have just been salivating for their next
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the people who are just livid that we
can't arrest anybody who's a minority for
[SPEAKER_03]: smelling like weed right now are fucking
thrilled that once this flavored vape
[SPEAKER_03]: thing passed, they could be like,
I fucking smelled cupcakes from the
[SPEAKER_03]: sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kicked the door in and arrested
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little wacky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we just need to, I don't,
I don't know the solution, but it just got
[SPEAKER_02]: to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to educate consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't bust people for doing something
they enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's, it's rethinking a lot of stuff
is how we fix that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everything about arresting people for
consuming substances that makes them happy
[SPEAKER_03]: is fucking just moronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not how cops were designed to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops protect you from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't protect you from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just passed Mike a green dot labs vape
pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what the flavor is of that,
but it'll be delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do preach that we don't need to pay
attention to the numbers on the lab tests
[SPEAKER_02]: because your nose knows your nose knows
what turps and flavors you like and how
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get affected by that
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your nose knows which product to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do like about the lab test is that
assures me that that product has been
[SPEAKER_02]: through a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been produced in a quality
facility, hopefully by an educated grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody that cares and knows,
but most of all, it's been tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it has been through the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's not super contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's in a vape pen, you know that
you're getting probably a quality product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it came from the dispensary on the
black and of course, dude, there are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be bad products that come from the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's honestly right now because we're
still operating in a federal gray area and
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't have access to the resources that
every other industry has.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like jewel knows for a fucking fact that
their heating element isn't causing the
[SPEAKER_03]: vaping crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open is pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt the people at green dot have had
that tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just straight up my guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong, but that's my guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't speak on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smaller the company is, the lower the
odds are that they have access to the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the resources to run the testing to be
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that doesn't mean that that shit's all
that much safer than anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just means they've run more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to get sued?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of this type testing before shit
hits the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've watched vape pens evolve since
they first hit the market here and their
[SPEAKER_03]: existence now makes me more comfortable
than their previous iterations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they were putting the crap in them
before the first couple that like the
[SPEAKER_03]: original vaporizers, the tabletops,
the volcanoes, those have been around
[SPEAKER_03]: since the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were making people sick,
we'd fucking know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, some of the medical studies have been
done on volcano vaporizers with people
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting in hospital rooms, vaping specific
amounts of product through volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we would be fucking sure if the act
of heating cannabis to the vaporization
[SPEAKER_03]: point caused lung problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as we went to the carts,
batteries started exploding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what's going into the cart was a big
question carts melting and leaking
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked with the guy up enough to,
to cook what's in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to work with a good friend who
smoked the, uh, I called it the robot
[SPEAKER_02]: dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a nicotine vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn you down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and choke to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would watch him and I'm not against your
vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what you want to do,
vape away bra or lady bra.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would get his vape thing and he had
this like, looked like a piece of fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: a cut up sock and he would just pour this
liquid fucking Serpy shit into there and
[SPEAKER_02]: then close it up and he would just push
the battery on it and it would fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: sparkle and crackle and fireworks would
come out of it and he'd go just right,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would hit it and he would take
these big old cloudy rips out of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: he'd make this face like it was heaven and
he would blow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated how good it smelled, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it smelled like nicotine's a hell
of a drug, but it also smelled like
[SPEAKER_02]: cupcakes and fucking cotton candy and
fucking heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, God, how did you just smoke
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it worried, I was thinking like,
bro, you're pouring like some liquid juice
[SPEAKER_02]: from China that just says like fizzy
cupcake e-juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we know what's in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he would just rip it and it would
smell so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, how many chemicals did it
take to smell?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it smells that good over here,
five minutes later, what went through that
[SPEAKER_03]: lung tissue?
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottle said strawberry cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he hit it, I went, bro,
is that strawberry cheesecake?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what kind of chemicals are
in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what kind of science shit,
like you're going to die from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was toast with butter and jam was the
one that was, I was like, dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got multiple flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's who knows what the fuck is in all
that mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think it's that shit that's
making people sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that it looks like it's
specifically something they're using to
[SPEAKER_03]: cut down cannabis oil because in its pure
form, like if you get 90%, 95% pure THC
[SPEAKER_03]: oil, that shit's like cold honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't work in a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've proven that some of those were
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the damage and the harm and the
problems in the hospitalizations were
[SPEAKER_02]: caused by a vitamin E cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think, but they're still not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is all, well, one of the
first things they realized was the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are getting sick aren't buying
regulated shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it was like, I say Juul,
cause they're the most popular one,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if it was like Juul's blackberry
flavor, like that would've come to light a
[SPEAKER_03]: long fucking time ago, just like it does
with the cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never see a food outbreak with
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of sick
[SPEAKER_03]: people, even though they're recalling tons
of food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you'll see a million pounds of
hamburger got recalled.
[SPEAKER_03]: One guy got sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three guys got sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a recall, 200 million pounds of
fucking cantaloupe, like cantaloupe from
[SPEAKER_03]: an entire region because the factor they
went through it failed the test.
[SPEAKER_03]: If what was causing these products was
coming from the legal market, it would
[SPEAKER_03]: have been traced back already.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's something that people are
buying online to cut in their garage
[SPEAKER_03]: before they sell black market cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking cheap and nasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad we don't have to deal with
that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even, if I didn't have these
pens, there's one other brand I would
[SPEAKER_02]: probably trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I didn't have these, I wouldn't
even be smoking them, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mainly bought these for a concert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And big shout out to the concerts for just
not even giving a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said multiple vape pins in that little
basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you got to walk through a metal
detector and they give you the little
[SPEAKER_02]: basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're going on a plane and you put
your, your wallet and your keys and your
[SPEAKER_02]: phone in this little basket, just set them
right in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy looked at me like three of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, it's going to be a
long night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, okay, just give me my
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that always makes me
laugh when I see people ranting and raving
[SPEAKER_03]: about how marijuana causes violence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like security guards and the cops
fucking be aware by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when they see a bunch of joints or a
vape pen, they just kind of nod and smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a big dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both tell each other stories of when I
used to drink, like some of our favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: stories to tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I don't drink and I'm,
I have shame in this, but I'm an adult now
[SPEAKER_02]: so I can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to fucking beat people up when I
drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about alcohol that I can
drink a few beers, but then there's one,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't know if it's going to be the
seventh or the 31st beer, but one of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a drink of it and I'll just
decide let's go fight somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who, I don't know why,
but something in my brain decides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're definitely not alone in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Punching stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I've chosen no alcohol for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm six, five and 200 pounds and
you're fucking six, four and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big enough to accidentally really hurt
somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And us together drinking and causing
problems would be fucking chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to say I'm tough or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying I know that I could cause
a problem for myself and others with
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke cannabis, I produce a quality
podcast that teaches others how to improve
[SPEAKER_02]: their lives and grow better cannabis and
fucking my friends all like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't wake up in the morning wondering,
Oh, where's my car?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I get home?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my wallet?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much money is left in my wallet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to go through my phone and
see what kind of stupid ass text messages
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent to anybody last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never woken up the next morning and
discovered I spent all the money for the
[SPEAKER_03]: rest of the week on weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I knew that the day I bought the weed
going into the transaction, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: something that surprised the fuck out of
me the next morning when I was trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: buy breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like waking up from the bar the next
morning going, where the fuck is my
[SPEAKER_02]: everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like that feeling at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just kind of being a smart ass
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've never seen a security guard
freak out over herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like unless they came up to you and were
like quit smoking it in here like two or
[SPEAKER_03]: three times in a row, like during one set,
then maybe there were some kids at Red
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocks one year, some younger security
guards that were younger than me that told
[SPEAKER_02]: me you got to put your weed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, bro, it's Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was before they got all,
Red Rocks is different now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got to put your weed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll fuck with you now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, I was like, bro,
this is Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, he's got to put it out,
man, or put it in the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had like a trash bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was taking shit from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go here, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just gave him a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he let me smoke after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just wanted some weed from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was just trying to be a tough ass,
tell me to put it out or take it from me
[SPEAKER_02]: so that he could get some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he let us smoke all night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't say shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they don't, they aren't worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're peaceful folk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us, there's an asshole in every
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just be smart when you're buying shit,
people in is, uh, is this stuff develops,
[SPEAKER_03]: follow the, follow the stories and watch
cannabis, CHS, cannabis, hypermesia
[SPEAKER_03]: syndrome is going to get tracked back to
something we're spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the vaping issue and the CHS
issue are two, those are two different
[SPEAKER_02]: stories, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about both of them, two
different, two different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same cause.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cause it's improper cannabis
procedures, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lazy stupid reporters, the CHS and the
vape pins are not related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two separate stories that we may
have blended together here at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the high part of the talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot to do with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also big giant shout out and thank you for
all of the feedback on the vape episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of great response to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave me positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I wish you would have said
more of this, but good job, which there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of stuff I wish I would have said,
Mike, you can see how many notes I take.
[SPEAKER_02]: I write down like four words for notes on
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to make it feel like we're just
talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I used to type it out and fucking
today on the podcast, we will talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The basics of growing cannabis come from
that's so boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of people doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have a conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I miss some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I talk way too long on other
things, but I got a lot of great feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people said that I missed a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people said I got great shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main thing people wanted me to make
sure that I mentioned was that it is all
[SPEAKER_02]: black market shit and they don't think
that any of it is vape pen or e-juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all black market concentrate pins is
what most of the information that I got
[SPEAKER_02]: back was.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted me to make sure to stand up
for the nicotine side of it is what I
[SPEAKER_02]: think most people were saying,
but I got a lot of great feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: The YouTube comments were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The emails were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The support, the feedback, just know you
guys are listening is fucking cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growing, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The podcast is getting huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our listens on YouTube are multiplying.
[SPEAKER_02]: If social media would be nicer to us
cannabis folks, we could really blow it up
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Social media is evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got mixed feelings on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, a lot of people think we should be
able to post whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that social media platforms
are owned by other people who have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of fucking lawyers and they can say,
Oh, you don't like the rules here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't play here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I went to the UFC and I was like,
Hey, I'm pretty and skinny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no punches to the face for this fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dana White would look at me and punch me
straight in the face and go, bro,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the UFC smack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, Oh yeah, I don't get to make the
rules here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how social media platforms are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You signed a little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't sign it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You clicked a little thing when he signed
up that said, I won't post dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get to decide what dumb shit is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they decide that your picture of
your puppy is dumb shit or your picture,
[SPEAKER_02]: your weed is dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do shit about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand that aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also I come from the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spoke of earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even supposed to be able to post
fucking pictures of my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to hide in the shadows and
nobody should know who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody should know that I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're posting pictures of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the fuck up and be happy about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and if you really want to post your
cannabis and you're afraid of your account
[SPEAKER_02]: getting taken down by any sort of sort of
social media police, join me on cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis can get away with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We encourage you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We promote your cannabis photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't buy or sell or trade cannabis
there, but if you post the photos,
[SPEAKER_02]: we definitely like to click like on your
photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of great giveaways,
a lot of good community happening on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a free social media application
available on your Android or Apple device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was a smooth segue for a great
commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my buddy Q grows,
um, support cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on there a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find us cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just stirred that a whole weird
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't assume when social media is the
same as news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Social media is not news.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's what I say social media is evil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not because it won't let you post
weed photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cause it's making society fucking
dumber.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's making us that our word.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not supposed to fucking say it is
retarding us from actually learning the
[SPEAKER_02]: truth because, uh, we are so distracted by
memes and just fucking headlines that we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't read any articles anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a bright clear line between news
and opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the news is Yankees for Red Sox six.
[SPEAKER_03]: The opinion is Yankee suck Red Sox suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both of those are fun and interesting
and important and both have a place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you confuse a for B and B for a
bad shit happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really bad shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when we're just talking baseball and
like we brought fucking smallpox in the
[SPEAKER_03]: playback people were like five years from
shitting on our own drinking water again
[SPEAKER_03]: and we don't turn this shit around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel better?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a, the section that we called what
really grinds Mike's gears?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love social media, but fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a huge love hate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stay there for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something to do when you're pooping.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just get in there and you fucking
release some shit and fill right back up
[SPEAKER_02]: with more shit from the social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to post and get trading actual shit
for digital shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I don't reply at all, you're social
media nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cause I'm living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't agree with me, you can find
me on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've given the people a good solid hour
of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming and hanging out in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was random.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not get interrupted by the UPS guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We dodged both our possible distractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's put that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: UPS guy or, and or gal, please deliver my
new stuff that I ordered.
