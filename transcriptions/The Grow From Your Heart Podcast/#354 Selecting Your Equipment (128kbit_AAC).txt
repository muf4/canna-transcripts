[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 354 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have become tradition that I
start the show off by letting you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of the blueberry
citron fambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms, on the last episode,
I described the flavor as oranges rolled
[SPEAKER_00]: in sugar with a hint of purple laffy
taffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be smoking this for a couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the third episode in
my long series of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past two episodes, we talked a
little bit about setting goals and
[SPEAKER_00]: planning your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talked more specifically about
selecting and planning your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this episode, we're going to focus
more in on the equipment and choosing the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate equipment for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the right equipment for the size
of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the right equipment to meet your
goals, and we need the right equipment to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet our power consumption limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into a podcast all about
selecting equipment for your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in a previous episode, we talked about
selecting your space and thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your space is really going to dictate
how much light you can put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your amount of electricity available is
really going to dictate how much gear we
[SPEAKER_00]: put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep these things in mind and have
realistic expectations of your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: while we're designing and building your
new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about selecting lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting is probably the number one
decision to make when designing a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small closet or a very
small cupboard area, your lighting options
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be limited to smaller,
lower powered lights that don't put off a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of heat, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they light your small space
appropriately, you don't need a gigantic
[SPEAKER_00]: light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a small closet or a cupboard or
something that's been converted into a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space, like a dresser or an armoire
or a storage cabinet or something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of incognito, something like our
friends at Love for the Plant would
[SPEAKER_00]: create, if you're running a small space,
maybe a T5 light would work in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to upgrade from a T5,
your next best option is an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are great for small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED technology has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have a lot of personal experience
with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't have a lot of experience in
small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen LEDs kill it in little spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do very well for small home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an apartment or somewhere
where you can't take up a lot of power,
[SPEAKER_00]: an LED is a great option and it works
great in a closet, in a cupboard or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: small piece of furniture that has been
converted into your little secret home
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space that's hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there in plain sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a T5 light is probably like your
beginner light, your lowest powered light
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would recommend growing cannabis
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a small space,
a T5 or an LED may work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we work our way into something like a
tent or a small enclosure that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: built or maybe a mini room that we have
sectioned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can work your way into
either more or larger T5s, more or larger
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy more of them or you can get
higher powered LEDs or there are also
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halide lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal halides are great in the
same way that LEDs are because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: put off a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The T5s, the LEDs and the ceramic metal
halides are going to be fairly low heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is heat, but not as much as you're
going to get from the high intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: discharge lighting that we're going to
talk about here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the T5, the LED and the ceramic metal
halide are great for a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put off a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also do not consume a lot of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are limited on electrical
consumption, those are great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage of the T5s, the LEDs and
the ceramic metal halide is that since
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't put off so much heat on their
own, you don't have to buy more cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment to plug in and use even more
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a win-win with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't feel like they put out
the same harvest weight that a high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity discharge light will put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're limited on space and limited
on electrical consumption and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: able to cool it, those smaller lights are
absolutely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk a little bit about high
intensity discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to focus too much on any
specific kind of lighting or brand because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to really sell you any type
of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you guidance on the things
that you may want to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're thinking about building your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to pitch you specific stuff
because that's up to you to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to customize your grow,
but I'm going to give you a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: blueprint and a really good idea of how to
get to your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about high intensity
discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: High intensity discharge lighting is like
a high pressure sodium or a metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are powered by a ballast that you
plug into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ballast generates more power to power
that large high intensity discharge bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put off a lot of light and a lot of
heat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen 250 watt high pressure sodium
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they make smaller, but I've never
seen it offered in a grow store or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never looked for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used and seen a 250, 400 watt high
pressure sodium and metal halide bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: High intensity discharge lights are very
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600s are fairly common and thousands are
the industry standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using high intensity discharge
lighting in a commercial facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are probably thousand watt lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably double ended Gavitas,
which is a whole step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that a little bit later
when we get into the warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a tent, you can use the
T5s, you can use LEDs, you can use ceramic
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halides, or you can work your way
into a small high intensity discharge
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a 250 in a small tent,
maybe a three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go any larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use anything from a 400 to a
thousand watt high intensity discharge
[SPEAKER_00]: light in a five by five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should be okay if you learn how to
control the temperature properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to duct the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a moment we will talk about ducted
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going with the tent,
you can use T5 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5s, you got to get them real close to the
plant to get a lot of real productive
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a lot of them T5s,
I wouldn't recommend it unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely are on a low budget for lights
and power consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs are very brand and style specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn the light you've got and
the plants you've got together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough experience with the
LEDs, but I've seen some kick ass product
[SPEAKER_00]: come from LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also don't put out a lot of heat and
they don't use up a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great in a tent or a small room
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceramic metal halides are very similar
to the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't use a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't put off a lot of heat and you
get a quality product that should make you
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be fairly easy to cool
in a small space in a small tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we work our way into the small
high intensity discharge lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you have to start thinking
about cooling the room much more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think about getting that heat
out and getting fresh air into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start thinking about
ducted lights or open lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about that more in
a second, but just keep in mind for now
[SPEAKER_00]: that the bigger light we use, the more
cooling we're going to have to focus on,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be more electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're pulling a bigger light and now
you're adding more cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doubling up your electrical
load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move from a larger space,
from a one light situation to maybe a two
[SPEAKER_00]: or four light situation where we've got a
larger tent or maybe a dedicated room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about our lighting options
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I would move away from the
T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't consider a T5 if you're doing
this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just wasting light, you're wasting
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got four lights, you need
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang up some real lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go with LEDs, get a quality LED,
something with high output, not a little
[SPEAKER_00]: starter LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good one if you're going this
route or multiple ceramic metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can place them closer together because
they don't take as much electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cover more of a footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they cover about a three by three,
maybe a four by four area for the 315
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your LED light is going to be very light
and brand specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should tell you what the footprint
covers on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go a little smaller than that and I think
you'll be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a room, step away from the T5s,
maybe get a high powered LED, maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple ceramic metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in a room, this is where we can start
using multiple 600 and or multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt high intensity discharge
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've kind of covered the pros and
cons of the LEDs and the ceramic metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't use a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make a lot of heat,
but they also don't put out like a high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity discharge light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about the differences
between a 600 and a thousand watt high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium bulb for flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: With two 600s, you can cover a little more
space with less shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: With one thousand watt, you can cover a
really nice space with a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to run two sixes or do you
want to run one thousand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the height, how much height
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your ceiling is low, go with the six
hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not able to do a lot of cooling,
go with the six hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about six hundred watt lights or a
thousand watt lights when you're planting
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The six hundred watt high pressure sodium
light will be more efficient if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to decide between a six hundred and
a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thousand is going to push your
plants just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now earlier what I said about shadows,
what I mean is if you've got one thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watt bulb coming from right above all of
your plants, you've got one source of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, you're going to create shadows
because you only have light coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have two sixes that are just a
little bit apart, you've got light coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from two directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will give you less shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of your buds will get light and that
is actually a little more efficient than
[SPEAKER_00]: one bulb and a bunch of shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is probably a good time to start
thinking about open or ducted light
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be clear about what I'm talking
about, when we hang up our grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: that enclosure is known as the reflector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we screw the bulb into the socket and
cord set.
[SPEAKER_00]: That runs to the ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ballast plugs into, it's got another
cord that plugs into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that reflector, they are available in
tons of different styles at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now let's think about vented or
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want a light that's got glass
between your grow and the bulb so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps that heat in there and we can set up
ducting to move that heat out of the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to allow that heat from the
bulb to enter the grow room and combat
[SPEAKER_00]: that with air conditioning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are reasonable options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have their pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not ducting your lights means that you've
got to cool that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you've got to add air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about air conditioning options
in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you do choose to vent your lights,
make sure you run the ducting to where
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the odor from your grow is going
to make it out of wherever that air is
[SPEAKER_00]: being expelled from your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to blow that hot cannabis
aroma right into the neighbor's bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that when you're setting up
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about carbon filters and odor
control here in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about if you want to duct and
have cooled lights or if you want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: open lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got ducted vented lights,
there will be a piece of glass between the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb and your plants that needs to stay
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that means more equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we need a powerful blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some ducting and we need something
running it out of the grow space,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly out of the house, which is going
to need to be camouflaged and taken care
[SPEAKER_00]: of discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage to ducting your lights is
less cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to need as much air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need one blower to blow
over the lights to get that hot air out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that hot air is going out of the house
or out of your building, you need carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration, which we're going to talk
about in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, most home grows were
designed with ducted lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commercial grows, however,
do not use vented or ducted lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use gavitas, which are hung really high
because we need them about three feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more from the canopy because they do
get really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so intense, not just from heat,
but so intense from light that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause burn and wrinkle and bleaching on
the tips of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a commercial environment,
we use non-ducted lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a home grow, it is very common to see
the ducted lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of home grows now, a lot of guys are
going hard and they're actually hanging up
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower wattage gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging up the gavita 750s and I'm
seeing great success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to know how to trellis and
control the height of your canopy if you
[SPEAKER_00]: plan on using gavitas in a basement or in
a bedroom unless you've got extremely high
[SPEAKER_00]: ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a home grow, here's a quick,
just a quick breakdown of how I would do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go carbon filter and I would have
the appropriate carbon filter for the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would have a blower and I would
have an appropriate blower to go with that
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter, either a six inch or an
eight inch, maybe a 10, maybe a 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the size of the grow and how
many lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then possibly a Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have a piece of ducting that sits on
my blower that maybe goes to a Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running four or six lights,
I will do the Y and I will run three
[SPEAKER_00]: lights parallel or two lights parallel to
where it goes carbon filter, blower,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then coming off of each side of the Y,
we've got a little ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got a vented light,
a little more ducting, a vented light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those two ducts, sometimes they come
together, sometimes they don't put them
[SPEAKER_00]: back together, depending on where I'm
exiting with that ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go out of the grow area,
whether out of the house, whether out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the building, just depends on where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it goes out of the room into another
room where it's taken care of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes carbon filter, blower,
maybe a Y, maybe not, and then lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then maybe back together, maybe not,
and then out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end there, it's always a
good idea to have something to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: other things from climbing into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get a mouse that feels a
bunch of warm air coming out of there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the night, and he's like,
oh, look, a little warm duct in a mouse or
[SPEAKER_00]: a lizard or somebody, possibly a snake,
climbs right into your ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: ends up in your grow light, cooks itself,
maybe makes it all the way to the blower,
[SPEAKER_00]: shreds itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put something on the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may sound crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pair of pantyhose works beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the local Walgreens or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may look like a weirdo if you're a big
dude, but buy a couple of pair of black
[SPEAKER_00]: pantyhose, and then just like a condom,
stretch them over the end of your ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: secure it with some duct tape,
and that way nothing can climb up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do sell more expensive options to put
at the end of your ducting, but pantyhose
[SPEAKER_00]: will work just fine if you use a couple of
layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a really random piece of advice
while I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got that end going outside,
you're going to have to put some bends in
[SPEAKER_00]: your ducting to prevent light from coming
down that ducting during your dark cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is light outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got that ducting that goes,
it's a carbon filter, blower, ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: light ducting, maybe another light,
maybe more ducting, then out of the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine the sun comes up and your
lights aren't on yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that sun is shining toward the
direction of that duct, it'll shine light
[SPEAKER_00]: right down that ducting, and it's
reflective on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to bounce through there and
end up into your grow room, and it'll come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the lights looking just like a grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a low-powered grow light,
but it'll be coming out, and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will think it's daytime because that sun
is awesome, and that sun will tell them,
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up little ladies, and they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some sort of a light baffle outside
and also bend the ducting on the inside to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and turn off the lights in
your grow and just hang out and see if it
[SPEAKER_00]: is totally dark in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see your hand in front of your
face at all, it is too dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need absolute darkness in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of talk about ducted or
vented lights and non-vented or open
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've both got their pros and cons,
but the light you decide may dictate a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the rest of your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful when you choose your
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about moving into larger
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a barn or an outbuilding
with high ceilings and a lot of electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, then I would recommend
moving into double-ended bulb technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are much more high output.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do put off a lot more heat,
but the plants will definitely show you
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pull about three pounds per light
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a double-ended bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know earlier I said I would try not
to talk about brands and pitch brands to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, but the industry standard for the
double-ended horticultural bulb in a
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado commercial grow facility is of
course the Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try not to recommend too many brands
to you, but I'll tell you straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use the Gavitas if I were going to
build a large grow right now, as many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them as I can fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want about one Gavita per four by four
or five by five foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a warehouse or a current commercial
environment, or maybe a large barn with
[SPEAKER_00]: high ceilings, I would always recommend
the double-ended technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would recommend a Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they do produce a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need more cooling if
you're using Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need those high ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you keep your Gavita lights
about three feet, maybe more from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've got some serious cooling,
you want those lights about three feet
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the top of your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of flower, if you've got big,
giant buds, you still need three foot of
[SPEAKER_00]: space, or you're going to start burning
and bleaching the tips of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for veg, you can use whatever kind of
light you're comfortable with vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5s work for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs and ceramic metal halides will
definitely work for veg for smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to get into a commercial
grow, I would recommend 400s, 600s if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can, or even just veg under your 1000s,
or in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to veg under Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make metal halide and high pressure
sodium bulbs for your Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because I know somebody is going
to ask, for vegging, we prefer metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halide bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want more of the blue spectrum for
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps your plants shorter and helps
them root.
[SPEAKER_00]: For flowering, we want high pressure
sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more of a orange and red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give you bigger fruits and
more growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So metal halide for veg, high pressure
sodium for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way different spectrums are going to be
available for your LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your specific light
manufacturer's options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many options for LEDs that I
cannot even get specific, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's quickly recap lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a tent or a small space,
T5s are a good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could work with a small ceramic
halide, or maybe a very small 250 watt
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium, but I wouldn't go
much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start working into the smaller
tents or a small room, that's when you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start introducing the bigger lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small HIDs, the 250 or a 400,
if you get yourself a five by five tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you can step up to a 600 or a
thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start working on a production
grow, you're busting out a whole room,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dedicated space, or maybe a larger tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can work your way into
multiple 600s or multiple thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you're going to run a
warehouse, I highly recommend double ended
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I recommended the Gavitas and they
do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that your lights are
going to heat the room very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need appropriate air
conditioning and you're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about air conditioning and
then we will work our way into air flow
[SPEAKER_00]: and odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air conditioning, cooling, in a small grow
environment, you can probably get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with a small window air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now maybe you don't have the option of
installing a small window air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use those portable air
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on wheels and they have ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a duct that brings the air in
and a duct that shoots the old hot air
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use those, but I do not use the
end duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use the duct that shoots the heat
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the air from my grow room being
recycled in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not bringing out that air from
outside and introducing it into the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no filtration in that air
conditioner before that air gets into my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to suck in some weird
stuff and bring it into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't use that duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use the out duct on a portable air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those portable air conditioners are
very inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cost a lot of money to buy and they
cost a lot of money to run, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: very discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very portable and they work very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll cool the room down very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of roll it right to where you
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to think about with air
conditioning is you've got air going out
[SPEAKER_00]: of your grow room now that is not
filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room with your grow is right up
against your neighbor's house also,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that air conditioner in that
window may not be an option because you
[SPEAKER_00]: might start blasting that sweet ganja
smell right into your neighbor's bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to be trying to sleep
and they're just going to be dreaming
[SPEAKER_00]: about smoking a joint at a fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful where you duct your air
conditioning air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another really important thing to
think about is how much air conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: do we need in a small grow, in a
residential grow, not a warehouse type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using thousand watt,
high pressure sodium lights, I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: about 3,000 BTUs of cooling per thousand
watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that again for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend 3,000 BTUs of cooling for
every thousand watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got two lights, you want
6,000 watts of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got four lights, you want 12,000
watts of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend go a little extra because
it's been hot lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every summer it gets hotter and hotter and
I don't want you to struggle in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the companies that make the
portable air conditioners make a 14,000
[SPEAKER_00]: BTU unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just about perfect for a 4,000
watt light setup, which is beautiful for a
[SPEAKER_00]: spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're in a tiny grow like a closet
or maybe a space that you've built,
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that you can't install an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you're going to have to cool that
is by putting a blower somewhere in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and exhausting the heat out of that
enclosure into the main room and then
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling air in through maybe a passive
duct from the room that's already got nice
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the room, it's probably
comfortable for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're ducting out that hot air and
just pulling in fresh air through a
[SPEAKER_00]: passive vent in like a small enclosure,
that will work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you've got enough power to
suck the air out of that enclosure often
[SPEAKER_00]: enough and also make sure you put a carbon
filter on there so that you don't snitch
[SPEAKER_00]: on yourself and blow that fresh ganja
scented air right into the living room
[SPEAKER_00]: where everybody's hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you've got this little
enclosure, it's all smooth, you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: fish tank set up next to it so that all
the noise is covered and all the plugins
[SPEAKER_00]: are covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an excuse for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time they walk past it,
they just get blown with wind that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that sort of stuff,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a small enclosure, you're going to
have to use a blower to close it or to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have to use passive
air from the room to cool that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, if you're in the room,
if that's where you live, if that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're hanging out, it's probably
comfortable for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be perfect, but in a
small enclosure, that may be the best you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about cooling a giant
facility, a warehouse, or maybe a small
[SPEAKER_00]: barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to cooling, Gavita lighting,
it is a totally different ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we move into industrial
cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we move into rooftop units.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't use little wall units and
portable units anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get big boy air conditioning
and HVAC setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're setting up an industrial grow
and you're going to hang Gavitas,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will recommend between four and 6,000
BTU per Gavita or one ton of cooling for
[SPEAKER_00]: every two Gavita fixtures in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I will recommend is instead
of one large rooftop unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you need 30 tons of cooling
in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that you break that 30
tons up amongst multiple units so that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a failure in one unit,
you can still run at three quarters or
[SPEAKER_00]: half of your capacity and not have to shut
down the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep it, just cool enough to
survive with three, but you've got four
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time, one breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've still got three running strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can push it and keep the room
cool, you're still in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one 30 ton unit and it dies,
you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are going to turn off because
it's a hundred degrees in there in no
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my suggestion to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Divide your HVAC into multiple units so
that when one of your units fails,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a major backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust me, your HVAC units will fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my number one complaint.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility, the HVAC,
it always takes a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always an HVAC issue somewhere
that I've got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is never a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of HVAC guys on a first name
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got their name and number right on my
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are on speed dial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Siri is familiar with the HVAC crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really don't be a cheap ass when it
comes to HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're building a home grow,
if you're building a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really recommend you get a good air
conditioner and keep that room nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will be really happy if you
get them in the low seventies or the high
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies, low eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will really show you a difference
from when you had them in the mid
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a huge difference in your
production, the quality, the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be better when you cool
them down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a really small space, you're just
going to have to use air exchange for
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work in a larger
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to figure out air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a window unit, if you're cutting a
hole in the wall and creating a window for
[SPEAKER_00]: a window unit, that's always an option,
but keep in mind it's going to blow heat
[SPEAKER_00]: out the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're heating up the other side of
that wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got yourself one of those
portable air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing has a duct that goes outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same thing to that duct that I
recommend you did to your light duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little panty hose over it to work as
a condom so that you don't get a mouse
[SPEAKER_00]: climbing up into that or a lizard climbing
up into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's kind of cool outside and they
feel that warm air coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, that feels cozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just climb right up in there,
put something over it to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we move into a larger grow,
you may need more window units or more
[SPEAKER_00]: portable ACs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those don't cut it, there's always
the mini split option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of skipped over the mini split.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mini split is a big unit that sits
outside and then it runs conduit through
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall and the mini split hangs on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about three feet long and it just
looks like a vent on the wall and it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: air conditioner vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of a mini split.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those run about 30,000 BTUs of
cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got about eight to 10 lights,
a mini split may be ideal and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they do make them in stronger models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we move up into an industrial grow
and that's where we start recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: rooftop units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm gonna recommend four to
6,000 BTUs of cooling per Gavita or one
[SPEAKER_00]: half ton of cooling per Gavita fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every two Gavitas you hang,
you do need one ton of cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now we know how to light the
room and get it real hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've talked about a few ways to
cool the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about airflow and
odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide to run ducted lights or if
you decide to run an exhaust vent in your
[SPEAKER_00]: room to expel humidity or stale air every
so often, I would highly recommend you add
[SPEAKER_00]: a carbon filter to that extraction fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to send unfiltered air out
of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the cannabis busts happening in my
city are based on a neighbor complaining
[SPEAKER_00]: of odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A neighbor says, hey, that smell is too
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decide which house it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops come, they knock on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up and knock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, hey, the neighbors say it smells
too strongly of cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You either say yes or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they make their next move.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say yes, they say, can we look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they come in and take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the right amount of plants,
if you're not over your count,
[SPEAKER_00]: they high five you and they say,
sorry to bug you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they leave and they tell your
neighbor, shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got enough plants and he's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got too many plants,
shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you probably say, no,
you can't come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they go, hey, because you got
too many plants asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when things escalate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself in trouble by growing
stinky weed and advertising it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the appropriate size carbon filter and
blower for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you blowing it over the lights to try
to cool the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you also using that carbon filter
blower and ducting system to pull air in
[SPEAKER_00]: through passive vents in that room while
cooling those lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yes, that will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you're sucking your
air conditioning cooling out of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also my theory is that that air
conditioning cooling is also helping cool
[SPEAKER_00]: the bulbs as it passes over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's real or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the way I have OneGrowth
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, do you need to move a whole bunch
of air over lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to move it a long distance or
do you just need to run that air through a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter and out of the room to get
rid of excess humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to do that,
hang your carbon filter up as high as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can in the middle of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the humidity is hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I always recommend the carbon
filter up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about your use of that carbon
filter and that blower and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a huge blower and a small
filter, you're going to suck a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of air through a filter and it's not going
to get filtered appropriately and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to blast that stank right to the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the appropriate blower and carbon
filter for anything that is going to exit
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recommend the fat filter and the
fresh filter because I have used both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both work very well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both last about 18 to 24 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't see a difference in either
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only recommend them because I was
satisfied with both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both affordable and they both
did what I needed them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forcing a bunch of air out of this
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air conditioner is going to send air
out of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've probably got an extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a filter fan blowing humidity
out of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we need to replace some of that
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to do that through a passive
vent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use a powered fan to do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your small enclosures,
your closets, and probably your small
[SPEAKER_00]: spare bedrooms are going to have enough
passive vents to allow enough air to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into that room to replace that air we're
pulling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably come in through under the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot more space than you realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you calculated that half inch gap by
three feet, that's a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of air can flow through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are replacing a lot of that air
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to replace the air much more
quickly, you can make a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're getting a whistle
from under that door and it's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull the door off when the air conditioner
comes on, if you've got pressure in there
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it's trying to blow the door off one
or the other, you may need to relieve some
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a passive vent may be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start with a three inch hole or maybe
a four inch hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere low on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make my intake vents low and my
outtake vents high because the cooler air
[SPEAKER_00]: is lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make a couple of holes and of
course you're going to have to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: lightproof also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of a way to make it lightproof
and also maybe consider stapling one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those HEPA filters over it to prevent any
bugs or anything from traveling from room
[SPEAKER_00]: to room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a passive vent is really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put a dryer vent over it once I've
made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a four inch hole fits
perfectly for a dryer vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just put the little dryer vent
over it and that way no light will shine
[SPEAKER_00]: through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also real low to the ground so
you don't have as much light risk coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But put it low to the ground, put the
dryer vent over it and you'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a four inch passive vent into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when the air conditioner is blowing
out all that stale air and while your
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust fan is sucking out humidity up
top, you've got some passive fresh air
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in through that hole in the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take any electricity or
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you really want to blast more air
in there, get one of those squirrel cage
[SPEAKER_00]: fans, cut a hole in the wall mount that
squirrel cage fan in there, you can run
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting or however you want to do that and
just blast more air in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's something you want to do,
it's probably not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need to move the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want air exchange and airflow in the
room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a giant tornado when they're
beating our plants up, but we do need air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small grow, I like to put one fan per
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a small bedroom with four
lights, why not hang up four fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you get plenty of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get any hot spots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a larger grow, I understand that is not
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not make any sense to hang a
hundred fans in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to place a fan about every six to
eight feet on the wall and depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the height of my tables or my benches or
my canopy, that decides where I place my
[SPEAKER_00]: fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely lower than the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be just between, hopefully they'll
be between the lights and where the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: my canopy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I'm using Gavitas, I've got a
three foot space between the light and the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in that three foot space,
that's probably where I would have my
[SPEAKER_00]: fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably right at the bottom of that three
foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Gavitas, three feet, and then a
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another environment, you're probably
going to have a light and then maybe like
[SPEAKER_00]: a foot, maybe two, and then your fans and
then the top of your plants right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you want to hang your
fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small environment, like I said,
about one fan per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a larger environment, I know that's not
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to go about one fan
every six feet on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can attach fans somewhere
in the middle of the room to some poles or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, that will always help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to beat the plants to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a hurricane in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to move that air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to rustle the leaves nice and
gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I discovered some fans that
mount to the ceiling and they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: pull air from the ground up and they've
got a louver that spreads the air outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air comes from the ground up and
then it's spread it across the ceiling and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that falls back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are great fans for any
facility that is using CO2 augmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring that unused CO2 up off the
floor and redistribute it back amongst the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also creates a lot of air flow in
the grow without excessive wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look into those fans if you need more
air flow in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you're in a home grow,
you can get those fans that are on a stand
[SPEAKER_00]: at Walmart, just basic stand fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy them right at the start of winter when
they go on sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Lowe's and clean them out because
they'll be on sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to buy your fans at the start of
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them in the winter and they are on
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In summer, they are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a grower trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to put fans low in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be odd to see a fan on the
floor in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy those square box fans and just set
one on the floor in the corner,
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing right toward the other corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to help a little bit
more air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And air flow is always your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it will help if you spill some
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need the floor to dry, a fan is
always your friend to help you dry up a
[SPEAKER_00]: spill.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've covered lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have covered HVAC and cooling and air
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the next couple of details
we should think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidification and dehumidification,
depending on your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: These may be crucial elements for your
grow in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have days where it will be 95 and it
will be hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the night, it'll drop to the
high 50s and it will rain We use every
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of equipment in our HVAC arsenal in
one day in a commercial grow in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use the heater in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use the air conditioner all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will use the dehumidifier all night and
we will use the humidifier all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about those items.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small space, maybe you can
get by with just a small humidifier like
[SPEAKER_00]: you would use for when you're sick or just
to humidify the baby's bedroom or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get a small one from Walmart and
maybe that'll work for like a small tent
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe a small bedroom grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're moving into a bigger
environment, you do need a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial size, industrial use,
humidifier or dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say I don't like to recommend
brands, but when you're entering into the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial dehumidification game,
I am of course going to recommend a Quest
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The units on wheels are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very expensive and very
inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The units that hang from the ceiling are
what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to set my dehumidifier up on
something like a Smart B or a PL grow unit
[SPEAKER_00]: and have something like that trigger it so
that you can dial in that room perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the dehumidifier knob.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a knob on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn that almost all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug that into a trigger that is triggered
by another monitoring device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you hit the appropriate humidity
level, that thing will trigger on for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love setting up a dehumidifier on some
sort of a triggering device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the rooms dialed in so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some more to run that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say you can use that water
that's collected from a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped doing it because after a while
the coils in that dehumidifier gather funk
[SPEAKER_00]: and that funk ends up in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, funky shit ends up in the tube that
drains from the dehumidifier into whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're catching it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen weird shit come out of that
dehumidifier water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stopped using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it to be unsafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said about your HVAC units,
I would recommend buying multiple small
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifiers if your budget works for
that instead of one large dehumidifier for
[SPEAKER_00]: when that dehumidifier breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still at least control the
humidity a little bit with unit number
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you keep the filters on
your dehumidifiers clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small unit or a large unit,
it will make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my recommendation for humidification
and dehumidification is to find a unit
[SPEAKER_00]: that is appropriate for the size space you
were trying to humidify or dehumidify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find something that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't worry too much about the
controls on the unit as long as it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: an off and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can plug it into something that will
trigger it and that will help us dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: our humidity levels right where we want
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want more guidance on humidity
levels and vapor pressure deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend listening to the vapor
pressure deficit episode that I did a
[SPEAKER_00]: while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is episode 314, Vapor Pressure
Deficit Bug Poops and Testing Samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
about 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have given you a lot of
information to absorb when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting equipment for your new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still a few details I would like
to cover, but I think I'm going to save
[SPEAKER_00]: that for the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, we'll talk more about
controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to plug everything
into?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to use to monitor the
environment in your room?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to use to trigger your
humidifier, your fans, your dehumidifiers,
[SPEAKER_00]: your extraction fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to use for that sort of
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also talk about pots, soil,
then we'll talk about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will talk a little bit about
integrated pest management and how all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things need to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start wrapping up this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you join me for the next episode
