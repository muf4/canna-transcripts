[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 119 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a hardcore dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a dab on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got the vaporizer loaded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you ate some good edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're smoking some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're doing, I hope you're
getting ripped with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting here smoking out of the Hitman
short stack with the e-mail attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This short stack has become my new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the Hitman short stack with
the e-mail on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I go somewhere else and try to
take dabs, I'm like, I missed the short
[SPEAKER_00]: stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go get the short stack and hit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass, glass rigs made in America
by Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass is an innovator in the hash
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not only a glass company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys smoke tons of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what a quality hash pipe work
looks like, how it works, how it
[SPEAKER_00]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what we're looking for,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, support the Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: This summer in California, there's a
festival called Chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a hash music and art festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very unique festival put on by our
friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I will see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough advertising for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I want to give a huge shout out
to my friend, El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_00]: El Diablo tried to make a contribution to
my podcast, to my PayPal page,
[SPEAKER_00]: on my podcast page, on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of words right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we talked a little bit
about this last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: My PayPal account was suspended.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, my PayPal account has been
deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do no longer have a PayPal account
associated to the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will find another way to accept your
contributions in the near future,
[SPEAKER_00]: but huge shout out to El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me an e-mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, hey, dude, your PayPal thing is
broken on your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him some guidance on how to get a
contribution my way, and he definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out, El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching my Periscope videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to my podcast,
and thank you for being my Facebook
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of my friends, I need to give a
huge shout out to Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Clark?
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm giving a shout out to Clark,
I want to give a huge shout out to Louis,
[SPEAKER_00]: John Randalls Jr., Louis, Haley,
Damsel, Joe, Amy, and an extra fat high
[SPEAKER_00]: five and a rasta fist bump to my boy,
John Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is most of the crew at Green and
Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple other folks that you
guys know you're included in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I cannot say your name on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You two assholes know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working at Green and Healthy
Wellness for several months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a crop in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been flowered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been trimming our asses off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the folks I just listened have had
scissors going constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their thumbs are going numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their eyes are going numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their noses are sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been trimming their hearts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that by the time this
podcast comes out, you will be able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado
Springs, and you will be able to pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers grown by Rasta Jeff and trimmed by
my trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them I told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a medical marijuana only facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Colorado Springs does not
offer any recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at 430 West Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring your purple card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring your ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're there, make sure you check out
some of this Cactus Cooler Live Resin or
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this G-Funk OG Live Resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some of my favorite shit I have
smoked in a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so a big shout out to the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to El Diablo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's brag a little bit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend's at Kind Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, my friend, I don't even
know if I should say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend was the owner of Kind Love,
and he received some seeds from me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sprouted those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a little fino hunting, and
eventually, one of those phenotypes ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the garden at Kind Love,
and it was a Lemon Jeffrey phenotype from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, and it was recently tested by a lab
at 30% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, iRegenetics is now officially in the
30% club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not grow it, but it is a strain that
I bred, so that counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Kind Love
Cultivation, and also a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my buddy, Sackmas Deflex on Instagram for
sending me the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might remember a couple of weeks ago,
we talked about a product called Guardian
[SPEAKER_00]: Mite Spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a product that was very popular
and very successful in the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff was knocking out any pest
problems that may arise, but one day,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was discovered that there was a
chemical or a product inside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle that was not listed on the label,
and said product has been banned from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation in the state of
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people put this product on their
gardens, thinking it was safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it was found out that their
garden is no longer organic because they
[SPEAKER_00]: used Guardian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it clear on this podcast that the
folks from Guardian could contact me if
[SPEAKER_00]: they had anything to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a couple of weeks, and I have
not heard anything from Guardian at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work for Guardian, if you know
somebody that works for Guardian,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you represent Guardian, if you know
something about Guardian, and you'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell me, you can contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get you set up on the podcast,
and you can tell the world what went on
[SPEAKER_00]: with your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put you on the air and let your
voice be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you guys, I want to get to
some reviews on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read some reviews,
and then after that, we will read some
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to the iTunes store
right now to open up the tab so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: read you some comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a dab while this pulls
up, and we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm going to read
some comments, then we'll work our way
[SPEAKER_00]: through some emails, which will kind of
work us into a short grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the first comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comment was sent to us by our friend
Tom's Astro blog, and it was sent December
[SPEAKER_00]: 10th, 2015, and it says, Here in Vermont,
we're in the midst of going rec legal
[SPEAKER_00]: through the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your topics hit on the very issues
the committee writing the bill are dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are doing their homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom, does that mean that the committee
writing the bills are listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're contributing to getting
those bills written, and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you write the bills, you include
somewhere to consume the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we messed up on in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the seed to sale thing figured
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice regulation system set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice production system set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing we messed up on here in
Colorado, people can come from out of
[SPEAKER_00]: state, and they can buy cannabis,
but there's nowhere for them to safely or
[SPEAKER_00]: legally consume that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation, when you're writing
those rules, make it legal to open a
[SPEAKER_00]: social smoke club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need places like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need places like the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Canna Canyon in Colorado
Springs, my favorite social smoke club.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a members only club.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay a small fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You prove that you're old enough,
and you can go in and you can hang out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can socialize and take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do another podcast from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a show from there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need places like that for members of
this community to congregate and hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: and teach each other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bars where people can go get
shit-faced drunk and get in fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm not going to judge the people
that drink alcohol, but you're able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go out in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get shit-faced drunk, and it's
available on every corner in every city,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is nowhere for us to safely and
legally consume the cannabis we can
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice to you in Vermont is to make
sure there is somewhere you can smoke the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that people are allowed to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Tom's Astro Blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge thanks for the email, and also,
huge thanks for the five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, every comment and every rating
that the Grow From Your Heart podcast has
[SPEAKER_00]: received has a five-star rating,
so I thank you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move to the next comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was left by Mr. Jones, 617 on June
15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: January 4th, and it says, this man is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish he was my next-door neighbor so he
could teach me how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, if I was your next-door neighbor,
I'd teach you a lot more than how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd teach you how to take fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd teach you how to carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be hanging out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be talking about your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be hanging out with me and White
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some messages, and be my friend,
and it'll turn out to where we feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're neighbors because I'll teach you
everything I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks for the message or the
comment, Mr. Jones, and thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is, Best Grow Podcast,
and it's from Rick Rat BMX.
[SPEAKER_00]: BMX, do you ride BMX bikes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be really cool if you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was younger, I used to ride
freestyle bikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a GT Vertigo for a long time,
and I had a GT Performer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually liked the Vertigo better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite trick was a 360 tail whip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a crazy kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't ride bikes too well now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like 6'5 and old, so I feel like when
I fall down, it takes me all fucking day
[SPEAKER_00]: to get back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more BMX for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're out there riding the BMX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Rick Rat BMX's comment says,
the GFYH podcast has really helped advance
[SPEAKER_00]: my career in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tips are on point, and the extra comedy is
always welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Rat BMX, I'm curious how I helped
advance your career in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in the legal cannabis industry
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what state you were in,
how you were in the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, and I'd like to know how I
helped you advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you start off as a tremor,
and now you're a lead cultivator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some info and let me know what I
did for you, and we will talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: on an upcoming podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tips are always on point, and you enjoy
the extra comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rad, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing that I try to keep it
lighthearted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a silly dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be too serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to laugh at some shit,
or you'll just stress out and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for listening to the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was able to move you in your
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what I did for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the comment, Rick Rat BMX.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move to the next comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, fun to listen to and great
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one was from photography by Jay
Young.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment says, Rasta Jeff is super
knowledgeable on all aspects of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and the many different aspects of
the Colorado industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a true statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't argue that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't realize that I know a
lot of different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody pointed that out to me the other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of sweet, so you're welcome for
me sharing that info, and thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the next comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there are a few of them left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, oh, that is not the right
button I wanted to push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, great show by Awesomeness
Incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left January 13th of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and simple comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, never boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't argue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for right now, this might be boring
reading comments, but the people that got
[SPEAKER_00]: comments on here are super fucking excited
to hear their name and their comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to those folks.

[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're applying what you're learning and
your plants are showing it to you.

straight up thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Job bless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Job bless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a podcast.

females in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a lovely female farmer on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you listen to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for telling me that I rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have a great spirit.

[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the compliment and the

[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's all the comments we have
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody who sent in a
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like me to read one of your
comments on a future episode, all you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the iTunes store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just go to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says customer ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says right there click to rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it a five star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just click right there and you just
type in some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what you really think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will read your comment on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm talking really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to remedy that, I'm going to take a fat
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get back, we're going to read some
emails, which will lead us into some grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang tight while I take a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will read your comment on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, everybody, we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I'm mostly back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a huge dab of G-Funk OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the dab of G-Funk OG live resin and
I dunked it into some super lemon haze
[SPEAKER_00]: from the clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get the opportunity to dunk
your dab into the clear, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big huge shout out to my friends at the
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also shout out to my friend who helped
me out with the clear concentrate that is
[SPEAKER_00]: straight from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get down to some emails,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email was sent to me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an email you'd like to send
to me, please do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may read it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy got smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants some grow advice on a strain that
I bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of sending it to the iReadGenetics
email account, which gets so many emails
[SPEAKER_00]: every day, this guy snuck in and he got it
to the growfromyourheartathotmail.com
[SPEAKER_00]: email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from, oh, he didn't sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not use your name unless you tell
me to or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not gonna read your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, still loving the show,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few harvests under my belt and
I'm enjoying this newfound passion
[SPEAKER_00]: immensely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently bought a pack of Dubwise from
Nature's Green Remedies and was wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had any advice for growing it
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking for a pheno that shows
the super silver haze, but I'm open to
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes to list a little bit of his
nutrients and his light.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mentions some other strains that he's
growing, asks if I have experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have not grown those particular
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on and says, keep up the great
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've definitely helped me get better,
cleaner medicine to a few people in my
[SPEAKER_00]: area take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I'm proud of you for getting cleaner
and better medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for Nature's Green Remedies,
they are now known as the Dank Team,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you're looking for high quality
feminized or regular cannabis seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: check out thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what they've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they've got iRegenetics products
in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main question was you bought a pack
of Dubwise and you're wondering if I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got any advice for growing that indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first piece of advice will be that
plant will get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit likes to get tall super quickly
on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put it into flower, it's gonna
double in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a three foot tall plant,
when you put it into flower, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a six foot tall plant be prepared
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got short ceilings, maybe flower
early, something I can recommend strongly,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant loves to be scrogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put out a trellis, if you put out
the screen and you let that plant grow
[SPEAKER_00]: into the screen, and then if it tries to
get taller than the screen, you grab a
[SPEAKER_00]: branch and push it back under the screen,
bend it down however you got to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: weave it all the way through the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can make that plant six feet wide
and only two feet tall, the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will produce a bunch of arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will produce a bunch of little buds for
you, not little buds, it will produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of like pine cone sized buds at
every bud site for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of one big glory cola,
you'll have a whole bunch of medium sized,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium sized pine cone buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scrog it out, stretch it out,
give it some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that fucker likes to get nitrogen
deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see it yellowing up early in
flower, step up your nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of that plant's parents are heavy
feeders and it will definitely eat up the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it short, scrog it, flower early
because it's going to get tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it plenty of nitrogen in the early
starts of flower and let it go long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing people don't like to do with
Dubwise, they don't like to let it go long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant could probably go, depending on
the funeral you've got, they could go up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 77 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to take it at 70, go for it,
but see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a big problem with letting
plants go too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm choking off the dab I took just
a minute ago, but I'm recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want me to say your
name on the air or not, so I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out thedankteam.com when you need
more beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to move on to the next
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this one came from our friend,
Mike O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike O has emailed us before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time he's not as happy as he was in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what Mike O has to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the podcast, but it has sucked
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have a new gig that keeps you
busy, but if you aren't going to keep up
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality, then maybe take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last few have been lackluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say the least, what happened to all the
old regulars?
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike is not around anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you get back to the grow talk soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you don't like the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one week ago when I had a guest
lined up and at the last minute I called
[SPEAKER_00]: my guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you want to come do a show?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, bro, I had to go to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some medical issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the recording gear ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping he'd be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot blame it on the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fucking had a medical issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my friends, Carlos and Alan come
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that wasn't the most amazing
podcast, but we put out a show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the best we could with what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next show was Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: That show was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the two shows when he
said they were lackluster because there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't much grow info.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just me and my bros hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis news, education,
and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those episodes were conversation,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every episode is going to be an
encyclopedia of cannabis knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do hope you keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten good emails from you before,
so I hope you stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot say that the episode with Sean
last time was not loaded with information,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there was your cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two episodes were conversation,
and you got plenty of news.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are bored with the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, but sometimes it's my duty to
bring you the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring it all to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not all of it is your flavor,
but I still hope you listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got a new child, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got a job and a new baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike doesn't find it a priority to be on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that that child and his family
are number one, then the job, and then his
[SPEAKER_00]: life somewhere, and then probably 25th or
30th on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope is my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's fucking busy working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got in a podcast and made ourselves
known, and we've expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all doing our own projects now,
and we're tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do have a gig that keeps me busy,
but I use a lot of that content and that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I learned at that gig for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's keeping me busy, but it's making the
show have content as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like the show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I hope I didn't lose you as a
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always going to have one negative
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to hide it from you or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast comes with a totally
different tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, you're awesome,
help and advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, Jeff, firstly, I want to say
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for such an awesome podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know your shiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says, if you're taking your
time, to read this, then I greatly
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then no sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I recently found your podcast and
have been listening at work for about two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, do they know you're listening at
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, going through a lot of your
shows and listening to them by title
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've took so much of your advice on board
and made so many notes, but it just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't seem to cut it when compared to
direct advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found myself researching dozens of new
things, which leads me to more unanswered
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That statement right there is partly what
inspired me to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably go to any forum on the
internet that talks about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and I could throw up a random
question, just anything about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, and I'd probably get seven to 10
replies pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that 50% of those replies
would be bullshit that would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: cause me more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the problem with the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go researching cannabis on the
internet, you do end up in a wormhole or
[SPEAKER_00]: what we like to call the K-hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just researching more and more and
more and more, and then you have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: debunk the first thing that you read and
go research everything else to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it all matches up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet can be a real bitch like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I came on with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make some of those things
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I know what I'm talking about,
and I try not to give you any advice that
[SPEAKER_00]: would destroy your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally understand what you mean about
having to do more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep reading with your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of ranty today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, many moons ago,
I grew for a few years and had some
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome results, but now I'm doing it
totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really remember the important
info, so if you're not too busy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to tell you my small setup and
info and ask you a few questions and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can shine a light on things for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had your skillset and know-how,
so any advice, tips, and recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever will be implemented and greatly
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand if you're too busy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say your name because I
don't know if you want me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice would be just what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do go to the internet and you
read some stuff, be careful of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read something and you think you're
going to do it, go smoke a joint and think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're going to do to
your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what that's going to do in
five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what that's going to do to
your plant when you try to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the whole cycle of your plant
when you do whatever you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to cut something,
you can't uncut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to feed it something,
you can't un-feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think seriously about what you're going to
do to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just do something to your plant to
do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a thought out reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a method to your madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably my first piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research it and have a reason why you're
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it again and then try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to try something new,
maybe don't try it on every plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to feed a new nutrient,
if you're going to do a new pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, maybe just pick one plant,
label that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just put a piece of white duct
tape with a star on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in my notes, in my notebook,
I write, the plant with the star is the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that I pee in every morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you see how it reacts to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wait a couple of weeks or depending on
what you do, sometimes you'll know by
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be like, oh, don't ever do that to
that plant again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got really mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've learned something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got one fucked up plant,
but you've still got the rest of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff will still be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can harvest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment with one plant at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some advice I could give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to email me the rest of
your setup, send me the size of your
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, what kind of light you're using,
what kind of nutrients you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me that stuff and I will try to get
you some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give the advice on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're doing is you're creating
content with me and for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to help me out and it's going
to help out more listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what kind of soil or soilless
mix or hydro kit you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some info to work with and then we
will get a podcast out aimed at you and
[SPEAKER_00]: other folks in your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can get people growing better
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope there was some useful advice in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a rambly mood today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the last email for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting up on 27 minutes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, anyway, man, I was wondering if
you can explain a few things to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me back or you can put it on
a future show if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here it is, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I wanted to know about salves and
rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get horrible knee leg and right hand
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear I'm going to have arthritis when I
get older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only 31 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, do they work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best kind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any firsthand experience with
it or do any of your boys?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question is, about salves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to know if they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I was skeptical of the topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think they would do anything,
but our good friends at Apothecanna gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me a bottle of their Apothecanna pain
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the red labeled pain-free cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually gave somebody a back massage
with it because they had a shoulder
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was rubbing their shoulder,
I noticed that my hands and my fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: were starting to feel fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like I had big padded gloves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fingers and my hands were high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was certainly working on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that I was massaging swore that
it made her shoulder better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom works in a cold environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works in a freezer area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got her some pain cream, some Mary
Jane's pain cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: She uses it on her hands and she puts it
on her elbows and knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says it helps her a lot with the pain
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that stuff does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for brands, I would probably recommend
Apothecanna over anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second in line would be Mary Jane's pain
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me another question that I am not
even going to read that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is hell no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you asked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, also dude, you mentioned
that you're going to have arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that could be treated by your
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you probably don't want to hear it,
but there are a lot of things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: eating that are causing inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would read about what foods that cause
inflammation like gluten, sodas,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that will cause your
inflammation which will make your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you cut some of that stuff out,
added a little bit of water to your diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll probably help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue and look for more
questions in your email because it's long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, also, I wanted to know what are
the best strains for pain, inflammation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and anxiety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good strains for pain and inflammation or
anything with a lot of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains like Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains like Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains like Kush Tonic or Kana Tonic or
anything high in CBD will be very good for
[SPEAKER_00]: your inflammation and your pain and it
will also help with your anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite strains to smoke,
it's a sativa dominant strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it makes my anxiety, if I'm nervous
about going somewhere, sometimes I just
[SPEAKER_00]: got to go places I don't want to go and I
don't want to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just in that mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I smoke some Tangy or some Jilly Bean,
that really puts me in a social chatty
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that would really help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue reading more parts
of your email because you asked a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked a weird question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, does Irene currently have any med
strains and if so, what do they treat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all cannabis grown is a medical
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just marketing is what some people say
this is a medical strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all got THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all got some sort of ratio of
cannabinoids and terpenoids in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a strange question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mean is it sold at a dispensary or
what qualifies a strain as medical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Email me back and tell me what you mean by
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, all of my strains are medical or
they're also all recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I break could be used for
recreation or medicine or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke, it's a little bit of both,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 50-50 mix of recreational and
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking because I like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I partially just like the rich ritual of
hanging out with my bros and taking some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs and laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like getting a nice head high and
being giggly and having a stupid grin on
[SPEAKER_00]: my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also like that when I smoke,
I have pain and I have some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those issues go away when I smoke or at
least are alleviated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice mix of recreational and
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any plant could be both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a little more into your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I got one last question,
brah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio
strains are good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's referring to the pain, inflammation,
and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, but I guess my question is if I
buy a 10-pack of a strain, and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say the name of the strain that
you put in the email because I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to include that into our conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I says, if I buy a 10-pack of a strain,
let's say I get a 10-pack of non-femseeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and I pop them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say they all germ and turn out
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say they are all different phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that ratio of one-to-one change
within the progeny?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how do you know what you are
getting exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of seed banks provide ratios,
but even I know that I'm probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get that same plant in the pick,
but I will get the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, sorry for the long ass
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to you, homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these days, I'm going to go to
Colorado and I'd love to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, no homo.
[SPEAKER_00]: No homo, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to meet you too, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, and do a dab with you or
maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just burn leaf like usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dads are a little scary, especially when
you have panic and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I truly appreciate that long ass
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to answer your last question
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought a 10-pack of seeds that were
advertised to have a one-to-one THC to CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio and you were lucky enough to get all
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know about lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd hope for a male in there because I'm a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd want a couple of males to choose from,
hopefully three to pick from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got that pack of 10 females that
you're hoping for and you flower them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way you're going to know what
type of CBD to THC ratios you actually got
[SPEAKER_00]: are by flowering those plants,
trying and curing the buds and taking that
[SPEAKER_00]: finished product to a testing facility to
test for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way you're going to
guarantee what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do it is to grow them out
and keep the plant that works best for
[SPEAKER_00]: your medicinal needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be the one-to-one ratio,
but you may find that golden nugget in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that works perfectly for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess to answer your question,
you do have a good chance of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what's advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much testing the breeder
did before they released the string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can make an F1 that comes
out nice and uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you make an F1 that throws out
phenotypes that are all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that F2 will throw out even more
variation, but that F3, you'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: narrowing it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start narrowing it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the breeder does it right, you should
get what's advertised very regularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll have to do the phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going to have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rely too much on the numbers as much
as what it does for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow all the plants, dry them,
cure them, and label them A, B,
[SPEAKER_00]: C, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a number, and then smoke them,
and then figure out which one of those you
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the looks of the plant,
the color of the plant, don't let that be
[SPEAKER_00]: your judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the effects be your judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have a good chance of getting
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting off topic, but you will have a
good chance of getting what was
[SPEAKER_00]: advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the conditions in your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotypical expression is very much based
on your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room is too humid, or too dry,
or too hot, or too cold, you're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get those phenotypes that were
advertised, because those were grown under
[SPEAKER_00]: probably perfect conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were done by professional
breeders, they've got very great rooms to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew that plant to its full
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the phenotypical expression they
were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get your room up to par
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short answer is, yes, the different
phenos will possibly carry different
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it very, very widely in F1
hybrids made by friends of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've seen them stabilize it down to
where we can get quite uniform seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the long answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a shorter answer for you,
because I feel like that one took forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I definitely appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a lot of great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say your name on the

show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great interview lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk about it,
because a lot of times things fall
[SPEAKER_00]: through, and then I sound like I was
talking shit, but I've got an interview
[SPEAKER_00]: lined up that I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of great guests coming
real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do an episode about how to
deal with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an episode lined up about how to
get your MED badge so that you can work in
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal industry here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to get Rob from Sour Seeds on the
show real soon, and we will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting male plants for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm lining up a live show at the
Canna Canyon with our friend Fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to have an audience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will take your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will let you know when that's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finalizing a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting on word from the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me to do an episode about
vitamin B and enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to get Sean on the show for
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will have a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a horticultural degree,
a huge horticultural background,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he will have a lot to share on that
one.
