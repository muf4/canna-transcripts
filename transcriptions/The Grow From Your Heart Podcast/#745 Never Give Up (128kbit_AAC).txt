the video description to make it nice and
[SPEAKER_01]: easy for all of my friends to support the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen I've been talking
about the outdoor season approaching it
[SPEAKER_01]: has been getting very nice here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in Colorado we did get a random
snowstorm here so I do feel bad for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody that put their plants out too
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the foresight, the forethought,
the awareness to wait an extra week before
[SPEAKER_01]: I put my plants out but I am excited to
say that today I was able to put plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a greenhouse breeding project
happening this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very excited, very eager to tell you
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to leak too many details
right here on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be an episode with very many
details coming up but stay tuned because I
[SPEAKER_01]: am super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some plants in a greenhouse this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as close to outdoor as I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do a lot of outdoor but the
greenhouse is ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a great location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody even knows that there's a
greenhouse there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a greenhouse set up with some
beautiful plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not very big now but by the end of
the season they will be monstrous and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will be filled with a lot of magnificent
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a big tease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned for future episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will talk a lot about the greenhouse and
the progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time I will reveal the plants that
are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in the very near future I will tell
you what male plant I have put in there
[SPEAKER_01]: because that will make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a male plant that you're used to
me using often so I've already said too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say I was going to answer an email
from a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not playing with my phone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message is on my phone screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have it right here but then of
course you know the iPhone does that
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I've got a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says what's up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point would you recommend someone
throw in the towel on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like our friend is having a
frustrating time in the grow room but it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I've been growing for half of my
life and honestly I'm unable to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that makes me proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm embarrassed if anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be a frustrating position to
be in and I'm sure that together with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of patience a little bit of
work we can definitely improve your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take patience and time and some
effort but I've got some ideas some steps
[SPEAKER_01]: some plans a solution to help you improve
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the next grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been saying for 18 years that the
next grow is going to be the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point is it insane to keep
repeating the same failure again and again
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce mids every time then they give
their name and they say sincerely thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this was meant to be for
the show but you've sent me a lot of great
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was my first favorite message that I
wanted to use on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep sending me the great content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have a lot of great ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is going to go straight to the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that got my attention here was at
what point is it insane to keep repeating
[SPEAKER_01]: the same failure again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Repeating the same failure again and again
is insane once or twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you like I got to try it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was a fluke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice some shit's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it a third time that's when I'm
going to start saying that you got some
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we need to do is not keep doing the
same thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you've been doing the same
thing for 18 years and it's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the time to assess the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what is not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a list of stuff here on my
computer screen that I'm going to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is time to find the weakness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is your weak point?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you not doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you not really good at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it going wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point in the grow are you noticing
that things are not up to your
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking maybe it's not really
good to compare your grow to other grows
[SPEAKER_01]: on social media, your friends grows on the
Discord server, but at the same time a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people are watching their friends grow,
their grommies grow on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying I'm at week four of veg and
my plants look like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If yours are much smaller, much more
spindly, less healthy, maybe there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something you're lacking and that other
person is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we get into flower if we're
comparing our plants and we see that this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy's way further along and has bigger
juicier buds and we're just getting bud
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can see that we're not up to the
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we could be, but don't make it too
much of a habit to compare yourself to
[SPEAKER_01]: others for your success.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a good guideline to kind of see what
others are doing and you can see if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping up, but don't make it the
template.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make it the expectation,
but it's a good way to see where do you
[SPEAKER_01]: fall off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your plants look like your friends,
your partners?
[SPEAKER_01]: The communities grow at week two of veg,
week three, week four, week five.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about week six?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you go into flower, when do they
stop looking good to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you see the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's find the weakness that we are
lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might already know where you're
lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may already be able to identify the
problem, the timeframe.
[SPEAKER_01]: About this timeframe, things start going
wrong and I'm not as happy as I could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you already know that, but let's pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do another cycle and take a lot of
notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's build a standard operating
procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's build a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's develop a streamlined flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a reason and a purpose for
everything that we are doing in that grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and while we are doing it, let's document
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make documentation so that we know
what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have a great outcome,
we've got an SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a standard operating procedure
of what to repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get a terrible outcome, we've got an
SOP of what not to do and we can look at
[SPEAKER_01]: that and say, well, this shit didn't work
and you've got some sort of a map,
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're doing that right
now, but that would be one of the things I
[SPEAKER_01]: really recommend is start taking a lot of
notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find the weakness in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a system that you are doing or is it
simply a product or a piece of equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: without really good lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are never going to be the top
quality plants that they could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many options available for
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the best light that your money can
afford for your situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of options when it comes
to lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a high ceiling, get a more
powerful light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a low ceiling, get more low
power lights and spread them out a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the best light you can afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then air, how is the airflow in your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you exchanging air?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you getting fresh air in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there air movement?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is the air dialed in?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the lights, we've got the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you giving them good water,
which includes nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you feeding these plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you buying the bottom of the barrel
cheapest shit you can get and feeding it
[SPEAKER_01]: very little so you can get by?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you buying the best shit that money
can buy and maximizing it and pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants to their full potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got lights, get the best lights,
get the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the air fixed, get air flow,
get the temperature, get the humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: get some wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have any microclimates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get all that stuff dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your water, do you have the right
nutrients, the right amount of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: at the right time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your pH correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights, air, water, how about your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you growing in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing in straight clay pebbles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going in rock wool cubes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that dialed in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you over-watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you under-watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your pH right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your soil drying up too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your soil staying too wet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are your rock wool cubes getting moldy?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many things to think about
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get the basics dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lights, the air, the water,
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I'm gonna talk about,
of course, as a seed breeder is genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been growing a genetic that does
not have a quality potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants will only get so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other plants will get so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not just saying that because I'm a
seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the only breeder out there making
amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's time to spend a few bucks and
get some better genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need a better light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need better airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need a better air setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need better water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need a better medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need better genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if all of that stuff is dialed in,
that's when we start talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual process of the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you've got the best race car on
the planet, you can't win the race if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't even know how to turn on the
engine and shift that bitch into gear,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not getting off the starting line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with the best equipment we
can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's get a very good grow procedure
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: By this time you've been growing for 18
years, you should have a decent
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand how to cut clones,
the veg cycle, the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have a good understanding of
the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would almost run a crop the way that you
do it and take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then look at it and see where did it go
wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you notice the plants aren't
performing up to your expectation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then just like anything in life,
identify the problem and then think of a
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we improve and correct this
problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we solve this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we move forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: So identify the weakness, identify the
problem, then let's find a way to improve
[SPEAKER_01]: upon that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of different thought
processes and patterns I wanna go down
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, are your mother plants healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you starting off with healthy mother
stock?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then do you know how to take healthy
clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there two thought processes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the plants healthy that you're
beginning with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then do you know how to create healthy
clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how to create healthy veg
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how to transition those
healthy veg plants into flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how to keep pests and
pathogens away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how to optimize the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how to dial in the space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn how to treat that plant exactly how
it needs to be treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe learn a little bit more about
identifying deficiencies and overfeeding
[SPEAKER_01]: and under watering and temperature issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start identifying what the plant is
telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rely a lot on equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times the plant will be sitting
right over there in the grow room and we
[SPEAKER_01]: will be staring at the computer going,
well, the VPD looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH of the water looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fan is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is good in the computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants are over there telling you
something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We forget to look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learn to look at the plants and read
those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what the plants are telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants have all of the answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rely so much on meters and computers
and toys and gadgets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started, it sounds like I'm a
dinosaur, but I haven't been growing for
[SPEAKER_01]: that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: The evolution of growing technology with
legalization has made it super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the tools, all the toys, all the tips
and tricks are already available.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started, I couldn't just get on the
internet and I couldn't just call somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was kind of secretive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have gone to jail if I told too
many damn people about the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to watch the plants and figure out
what they were telling me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learn to watch those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we're forgetting about also is
the relationship with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The computers, the toys, the gadgets,
the devices, they've kind of removed us
[SPEAKER_01]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking into the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cool shit there,
but everything we need to know is over
[SPEAKER_01]: there on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go sit by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go observe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to notice more looking at the
plants than you ever will the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't figure it out by looking at
the plant, look at the screen,
[SPEAKER_01]: then put the math together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely focus more on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say, hey, my runoff
numbers are looking good or this number
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't look good on the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my response is, how do the plants
look, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the plants okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, yeah, the plants look great,
but my numbers are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, the meters don't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not growing pH meters and EC meters
and that doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what the plants look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what really matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got off on a ramble there,
but learn the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn to identify deficiencies,
overfeeding, underfeeding, overwatering,
[SPEAKER_01]: underwatering, heat stress, cold stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever thought that you can just
reach over and touch a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like mom used to do when you're a
little or your dad used to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you need a jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, no, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just reach down and touch you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, you're cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd give you a jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reach out and touch your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Touch them, feel them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they cold?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they feel slimy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're so humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Touch them, learn them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would run a full cycle and I would
take a lot of notes and pay a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start from the very beginning and build a
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take notes and observe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here's what I want you to think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you doing everything you're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the purpose for everything you
were doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be a rhyme or a reason for
what you were doing to those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also think about what are you not
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you popping and twisting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you lollipopping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you defoliating?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you perfecting the pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you dialing in the EC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you making sure that the VPD in the
room is correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you not doing that you should be
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about what you are doing and make
sure that every move, everything you do
[SPEAKER_01]: has a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that you learned from some
random dude 20 years ago that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't even need to be doing that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wasting your time or messing up the
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you doing everything you were
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then why are you not doing a lot of
the things you know you should be doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things you skip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we all do that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now while you're doing all these
things, notice also when your plants stop
[SPEAKER_01]: living up to your expectations,
and take notes, it probably happened
[SPEAKER_01]: seven, 10, maybe 14 days from when you see
the turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably where you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're taking a lot of notes,
we can go back in all those notes,
[SPEAKER_01]: write down, when you go into the grow,
you should start taking documents from
[SPEAKER_01]: like 901 AM, open to the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: 905, fed the plants this and write down
exactly what you fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write down the pH and the EC and the PPMs
of what you fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then collect some of the runoff and write
down what the runoff was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said that those numbers don't
matter, but they will help us diagnose a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem because you're trying to improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feed the plants, write down what time
you fed them, how much, EC, pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM, get all the data you can of the
solution going in and coming out of those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do any defoliation, if you do any
popping, twisting, lollipopping,
[SPEAKER_01]: write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't do anything, write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you notice some weird shit,
write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of your equipment does anything
weird, write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we've got a record.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some sort of a record.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some data.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we can look back and see what the
hell is going on in your grow and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: see where to improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said improve kind of weirdly there,
but let's make a record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make an SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make a standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make a flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use quality products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then have a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start noticing your plants aren't
reaching the expectations, then we can
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the plants how they are and we can
look back a couple of weeks ago and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we should have done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do this or we should not have
done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're spraying anything, definitely
write that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of sprays could have adverse
reactions to your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a nutrient thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's something you're doing,
but take good notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get to the point when you
notice it's not where you want it to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: send me some pictures and we can talk
about it together and I'll help you get it
[SPEAKER_01]: dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about really intently,
why are you doing what you're doing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is everything you're doing purpose or is
it ritual?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's purposeful, where did you
learn it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that has been tried and
true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it been proven?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just a move that actually could
be diminishing your results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it be messing up the outcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it be a complete waste of time and
money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or could it be greatly improving your
product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that every time you make a
move in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just ritual, let's get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people have to do weird ritual
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a waste of time, stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's something that keeps your OCD
under control, I get it, but let's imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: to minimize the weird shit we do in the
grow just because our uncle taught us to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that seven years ago and we've been
doing it ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been doing it wrong maybe for seven
years, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to growing, there are a lot
of things to dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of equipment to think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of feeding to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of technique to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, genetics make a big role,
make a big part in this whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole chess board here is what I like
to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things to dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't focus on dialing in everything all
at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go baby steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's identify a couple of small problems,
make a few small changes because if you
[SPEAKER_01]: make a bunch of big changes, how do you
know what worked, what didn't work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make one or two changes at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been growing for 18 years and
you're frustrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get you a little bit better over the
next couple of years, we will see
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you feel encouragement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already got all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get you improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get you going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your question was how long do I go until I
throw in the towel?
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing is that we identify the
issue and make some corrections and make
[SPEAKER_01]: some changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that you had the right
guidance and the right idea to make those
[SPEAKER_01]: corrections and changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully I can help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things to think about
and dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make small changes one step at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't change too many things and do
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying this too, and this goes to
everybody growing out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do everything in your garden with intent
and purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go, why did you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have a good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't just be, Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just because it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that because of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there should be a solid answer and a
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that while you're in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that while you're mixing
nutrients, cutting clones, defoliating,
[SPEAKER_01]: lollipopping, topping, popping,
twisting, putting up the trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about why am I doing this the way
that I am doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would Rasta Jeff do in this
situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're doing some silly shit that is
wasting time causing problems and
[SPEAKER_01]: minimizing your potential for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want anybody to quit growing out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're planning on quitting,
if you're getting frustrated, please send
[SPEAKER_01]: me a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what's frustrating you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know where you're stuck and I will
do my best to get your message here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get your grow up to speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get you over the hump.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get you up in the winning team.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal is to have everybody out there
growing the best cannabis that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody out there to feel like
they've got cup winning cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want all your friends to think that
you've got better cannabis than them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best feeling when you're like,
bro, I grew some good weed, but that weed
[SPEAKER_01]: that you grew is a little bit better than
mine and I want to get that good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody to be striving to be the
best and reaching that goal of having
[SPEAKER_01]: quality cannabis everywhere we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, every concert I go to,
every comedy show I go to, every gathering
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to, somebody pulls out weed and I can
go, that's going to be good weed because
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been spreading the word,
teaching the gospel all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want you guys to all be as good of a
grower as I am, if not a better grower
[SPEAKER_01]: than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you see true progress when the
next generation does better than the
[SPEAKER_01]: previous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my goal here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach you guys to be and gals and
everything in between and both to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: best growers that you possibly can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my dude, I don't need to say
your name on the air because I just read
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're thinking about giving up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to embarrass you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only here to encourage you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please feel supported and encouraged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel that you are limited by
genetics, I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've sent me a lot of emails,
which is cool, bro, but keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bro, settle down, but also keep them
coming because I like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But holy shit, dude, you send me a lot of
emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need a pack of seeds because you
don't feel like your genetics are reaching
[SPEAKER_01]: your potential, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to give you some fresh,
high quality beans, get you going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a phenohunt, find the phenotype
that works best for you, then grow that
[SPEAKER_01]: one to perfection, build a relationship,
build a system with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe possibly the genetics are your
limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else out there, ladies,
gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps,
[SPEAKER_01]: hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, pollen chukers,
[SPEAKER_01]: new growers, pro growers, frustrated
growers and cup winners.
