[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now that we made it through
that mouthful, I want to give a big shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to my friends at the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, I was on the Dude Grows
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show was recorded Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Scotty Real and the dude,
and of course to my buddy, Grambo,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also to the entire panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a Dude Grows panel show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was myself, Michigan Matt, and Hot Rod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my new friend,
Michigan Matt, and my buddy, Hot Rod,
[SPEAKER_01]: for being on the show with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a lot about cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it was a very informative
show, so if you're not already watching
[SPEAKER_01]: the Dude Grows show, most of you already
are, if you're not already watching,
[SPEAKER_01]: go give my friends a follow at the Dude
Grows show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you watch the episode where I
was on the show and leave some comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know how much you enjoy me on the

[SPEAKER_01]: Big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the entire DGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Scotty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big love to Grambo.

[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I hope to see you guys at the Dude
Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, June 1st in La Porte,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's easier to say than it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: June 1st in La Porte, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the DGC Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an early heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will do a lot more advertising in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, where do we want to go from
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've covered all of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: iRedirect is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you are looking for a gift
certificate for iRedirect, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies, I was talking to your man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he wanted iRegenetic seeds for
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said you might not know what to get
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easy way to do it is to send me an
email and let me know that you would like
[SPEAKER_01]: to purchase a gift certificate for
iRedirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many ways to email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend rostegef at iRegenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in the subject line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in gift certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I'll know exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can respond to you and let you know
how we can get you a gift certificate for
[SPEAKER_01]: your significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other for the holidays, or if you just
want one for yourself, whatever you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can now do a gift certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get that taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I covered all the important notes
we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the email portion of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of great emails here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, at the start of the show,
I did say I was going to give away free
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is how you can win free seeds from
listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to my website, iRegenetics.com,
there's a tab that says grow help.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that grow help tab,
we will ask you a few questions at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to type in a little paragraph
about your grow problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know what's going on in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon for a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of iRegenetics premium seeds on
iRedirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to iRegenetics or iRedirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a grow help tab on both of those
websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do read your grow question here on
the show, you win free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's first question came from my new
friend, Matt, and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question says, I hope you and yours
are well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the well wishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everything is well for your family
and yourself and your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message says you've already answered
one of my questions before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I have not been able to pop
the free seeds you sent me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I will send you a coupon for
another free pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I should probably say that from now on
only one pack per person or some shit like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get another pack, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rules are made to be broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sneak them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your shit twice and I don't
realize it, then you'll win free seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thanks for being honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says my question is as follows.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a longer flowering time plant is
pollinated, do those seeds also take
[SPEAKER_01]: longer to reach maturity in your
experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care from Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Matt, this is a really great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer is no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time seeds take around six to
eight weeks to be done from the time
[SPEAKER_01]: they're pollinated till the time you can
harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few things that can speed or
slow that down or speed it up or slow that
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in most cases, you're looking about
six to eight weeks for seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that some of those longer
flowering plants will take longer to be
[SPEAKER_01]: ready for pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the caveat with those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all plants want pollen at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a plant that takes longer to finish
quite often will want that pollen later in
[SPEAKER_01]: its flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seeds themselves are not going to
take longer to finish, but it may be
[SPEAKER_01]: longer before that plant is ready for the
pollen itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two good examples in my garden that I've
used quite often are the Platinum Tangy
[SPEAKER_01]: female and the Strawberry Fields female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed with both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Platinum Tangy makes, of course,
the orange gas and it makes Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's making some other stuff in the near
future here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also made the Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, we've got the
Strawberry, the Strawberry Fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes the Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes the Raphael.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one also makes the Red Pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a bunch of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of those plants I use in the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a bunch of great things with
both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I have learned is that the
Platinum Tangy plant wants pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing where I should start,
I guess, the Platinum Tangy plant finishes
[SPEAKER_01]: much sooner than the Strawberry Fields
plant does in a normal flower room by
[SPEAKER_01]: about 7 to 10 days, depending on the
conditions, the environment, the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it as much as 7 to 10 days
difference in flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I've definitely noticed as well
is a 7 to 14 day difference in peak
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination times of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just two plants in my room that
are very common that I breed with a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now imagine the variance within all the
plants that I work with and have worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've noticed is, so your question is,
do the seeds take longer if the cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: takes longer?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to that is no, but the part I'm
talking about now is sometimes certain
[SPEAKER_01]: plants will take much longer to be ready
for the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most plants, it's about like day 23 to 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got about a 10-day real prime window,
but with some of them, the longer
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing plants, it could be day 27 to
day 37, I guess, would be that nice 10-day
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them actually, they give you like
a 3-week flowering window where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate them in the pistols or super
ripe if it's a longer flowering phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: or a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, do the seeds take
longer?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but sometimes it takes longer for the
female plant to be ready to accept that
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my friend, Matt, that is a really
great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I've got your email address
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as that's an underscore,
I've got all the info I need to send you a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a gift certificate for
iReadDirect.com so you can grab that free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, by the time this episode comes
out, if you have not found that coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: code, please do check your spam email
because many of those coupon codes do go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the spam.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Matt, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep this show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some good momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this next question came from my
new friend, Q.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, Q.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have won a gift certificate for a free
pack of seeds on iReadDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your email for that
gift certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, make sure you check the spam if you
have not found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you don't get that, send me an
email because I want to make sure there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no glitches in my matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hello, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Q.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, my question is more related to
iRead Genetics website than my grow at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been expecting this
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been waiting for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I was looking on the iRead
website for the descriptions, histories,
[SPEAKER_01]: and lineages of the seeds, and I have
found that those are no longer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this something that had to change to
keep iReadDirect online?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I'm doing more updating,
so you may have noticed that a little
[SPEAKER_01]: while back iReadDirect disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk more about why iReadDirect
disappeared and how I rectified that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation on a Patreon episode in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you know when I record that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you know when that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, iReadDirect did have to shut down
for a brief moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was working on getting iReadDirect
repaired and rebuilt and back online,
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized there were a lot of other
things that needed to be done to
[SPEAKER_01]: iReadGenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I focused at that point on getting
iReadDirect back online.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got that one back it is up and running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now iReadGenetics is under construction,
but I've gotten most of the website back
[SPEAKER_01]: up in a satisfying form, but I do have to
work on the genetics page.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetics page is currently under
construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are approximately, or were
approximately, somewhere between 100 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 120 strains on that website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am updating every description by myself
by hand one at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is taking a little bit longer than I
had anticipated to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a helper helping me with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to type in aroma flavor,
flowering time, morphology, grow tips,
[SPEAKER_01]: what else, smoke reports, a bunch of
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going through my notes and finding all
those things, compiling those,
[SPEAKER_01]: and making a nice new updated genetics
website for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the strain page will be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there will be a Patreon podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a Patreon podcast about what
happened with iReadDirect, why it had to
[SPEAKER_01]: disappear, how it came back, why
iReadGenetics is set up the way that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you are going to ask about some of
the new stickers you're getting on your
[SPEAKER_01]: packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that will be covered on the Patreon
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not already on the Patreon,
make sure you check out patreon.com
[SPEAKER_01]: forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'll let you know when it comes
out so you don't sign up for Patreon for a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of months and don't see the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm honestly still catching up trying to
do the website work, getting my feet back
[SPEAKER_01]: under me after iReadDirect got closed
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, updating those website
descriptions takes much longer than I had
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do so many at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I've got them all up there,
we'll go ahead and relaunch that page.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I was ready for that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wanting to explain a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I love the show and the seeds you
make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running Lemon Jeffery and Nuketown
currently while getting Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_01]: number five started for the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, bring the Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring the Nuketown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring the Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it all to the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot wait to see you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot wait to smoke some of your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannot wait to shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, cannot wait to high five you when we
are on the podium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winning the DGC Cup together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wraps it up with, I hope to hear from
you, but if not, I understand you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it real and spread the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I'm glad I was able to answer your
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for getting me hyped up about
the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, make sure you check that email once
again for that free coupon for that free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds at iReadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've got one more quick message
here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to burn through this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from the Grow Help tab on
iReadGenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that my friend Minnesota Joe is
going to get a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of iReadGenetics premium seeds off of
iReadirect.com, where we are currently
[SPEAKER_01]: hosting a Black Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Friday pricing on the entire
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good stuff up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab your orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are packs of Inspector Royale up
there for 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a three pack, to be honest with you,
but three seeds for 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go grab them.
[SPEAKER_01]: iReadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, what's up, my friend Minnesota Joe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to everybody in Minnesota
for working on the cannabis legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been sending a lot of seeds that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question says, I have been a listener
for several years now, and I love all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge and positive vibes that you
give to the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, there's so many key words in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love, knowledge, positive vibes,
and community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing all of that,
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm currently running both your
orangegasm and lemon jeffery strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're looking like absolute fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, you've got a good lineup right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LJ and the OG are great together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put my name on one of them, and the
other one is my best seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crush those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I had a question about finishing
a plant in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I know there are several products
on the market to help finish a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I have several different products,
but I'm not sure which one I should use,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if I can combine products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he goes on to list of the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they're asking about is which
products to use for finishing the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of products that are sold
as just plant finishers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are products that are sold as
flushing agents and products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's harder to say than it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys put all those peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Peter Piper sold a product for
flushing purple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to say that in a row, bro,
but there are products that they sell to
[SPEAKER_01]: help you flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are products that they sell to help
the plants finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many products available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one that I do recommend that is
actually on this list, so we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about some of the products that my
friend has.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were kind enough to include a list
with the message, and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I have unsulfured molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need that toward the finishing
stage of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is more to feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, you've got a good microbe
colony in that rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably cut out the unsulfured
molasses at the end of the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I've got Kana zime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume that's an enzyme product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use that sparingly toward the end
of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a whole bunch of enzymes,
but keep a little bit of that in there
[SPEAKER_01]: just to keep cleaning up that root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're running hydro, definitely
continue to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it also says I have a flushing agent
called FloraClean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you need FloraClean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think a flushing agent like that
is necessary at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, that is just an agent
that will get in there and break up the
[SPEAKER_01]: salts that are bound into your plant and
help those loosen up from the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: and help you clean out the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were watering properly,
getting runoff, not overfeeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could probably skip the FloraClean
unless you really want to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do use that, use as directed for
your last two, maybe three waterings at
[SPEAKER_01]: the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says I've got New Millennium
Winter Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly recommend using Winter Frost as
recommended on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it just like it says.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks at Winter Frost are freaking
geniuses, or the folks at New Millennium,
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter Frost is a great bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend using that exactly as
recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: So use your nutrients up until the day
that you decide to use the Winter Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the Winter Frost and then follow those
instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're finishing with your products
that you've got, that's what I would
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, here's the part where I
really wanted to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to answer the question so I
could talk about this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I currently grow Synganically,
and then fucking buzzers went off in my
[SPEAKER_01]: head when you said Synganically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the Botanic Air Nutrients and a
Pro-Mix Ocean Forest 50-50 Soil Mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice mix, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botanic Air Nutrients, Pro-Mix,
Ocean Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds nice, nice and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some aeration in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I be using one of these products
over the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What order?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One love from Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my boys in Minnesota and
gals in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my new friend Minnesota
Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's what I want to ramble on to
wrap up the show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said the word Synganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know who that comes from,
and I got nothing but love and respect for
[SPEAKER_01]: all of my cultivation community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're my friend, even though I'm gonna
say Synganic is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to stop saying Synganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Synganic is like saying I'm vegan,
but I eat steak on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you're not vegan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic means it is made up of organic
elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no non-organic thing in your
mixture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you add something that's not
organic, guess what you just did?
[SPEAKER_01]: You wiped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You erased the word organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Synganic, dude, that's driving me
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say I used a mixture of bottled
nutrients, or just don't say Synganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way I could put it is to say I'm
sober, but I do heroin on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Synganic sounds like to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my complaint for this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us have pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us have a podcast where we get to
fucking talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys send me your grow room or grow
community pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll read those on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to keep it positive, but I will
do it in a funny light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got some funny grow peeves,
send those to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do those on the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you've got a chance to win free
seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what your grow room or grow
community pet peeves are.
[SPEAKER_01]: What drives you crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your version of Synganic?
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, if you do send me your pet
peeve at the grow help tab, and I read it
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the podcast, I will send you a
coupon code for a free pack of seeds on
[SPEAKER_01]: ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get those coupon codes,
they basically work like a gift
[SPEAKER_01]: certificate, and you can still use all the
coupon codes, the discount codes that come
[SPEAKER_01]: along with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a discount code,
if you're a Patreon member and you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: gift certificate coupon code, all the
other codes will still work with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to get the fat hookups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me those pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read it here, free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I'm going to try to keep it
funny and keep it lighthearted if I do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but send me those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to thank you once again for
listening to another episode of the Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns, make sure you reach
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email is growfromyourheartathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, if you have those grow help
questions, go to my website ireagenetics
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you qualify for the free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the only way to get the free seeds
is using the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send those grow room pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you could possibly need is
on the website ireagenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to I redirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to the discord server
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out on the discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, everything you could possibly
imagine except the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are coming ireagenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's all I've got for you for
this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back in another week with fresh
new content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a big shout out to my
friend Blue Kiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big up yourself every time, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to take another damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab your peace and a hug up out the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sit back, hook him up, be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taur.
Taur.
Taur.

Rasta Jeff is in the lab.
