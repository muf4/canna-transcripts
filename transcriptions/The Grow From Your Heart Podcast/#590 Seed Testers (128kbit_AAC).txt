and it is time for episode 590 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to talk about
what I expect from testers when I send
[SPEAKER_00]: them test seeds.

[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes to make it nice and easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I said I was going to talk
about tester expectations, what I expect
[SPEAKER_00]: from testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to waste a lot of time here
at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tester expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, maybe you're not familiar,
I am of course the head proprietor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder, the founder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only dude, the only person of
iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make premium, regular and feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I do also outside of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, most of you know that,
but visit the website iregenetics.com for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the details there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I talking about testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I breed new creations and I
need help testing those to make sure they
[SPEAKER_00]: qualify for the market before we put them
out for everybody to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I create a bunch of new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my male plant in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them pollinate a bunch of familiar
females so I can replenish my stock for
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm at it, I'll throw in a couple of
new females in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't know what those females are
going to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll grow a few of them out myself to
make sure they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good quality, make sure they pass my
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the breeder, they better pass my
standards, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the mom plant was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the dad plant was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all the ingredients to the pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should know how to bake the pie
perfectly at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They better come out good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw all those away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't pass my germination
expectations, if they don't grow well for
[SPEAKER_00]: me, if it doesn't reach my overall goal,
I will throw the seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do reach my expectations,
reach my goal, my next step is to send
[SPEAKER_00]: them out to testers so that other growers
can grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about what I expect from
the testers, who the testers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tester expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I choose testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people ask me the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I be a tester?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you choose the testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Testers are chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excuse me if I don't stare into the
camera a lot this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to stay a little bit
focused today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tester expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testers are chosen from social media,
forums, and from mainly my gang of misfit
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little group of friends that I
hang out with, I grow with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get first dibs at the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're local and I can go see your
grow, I can take pictures of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really prefer that you get the seeds
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my local group of misfit grower friends
get the seeds first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the social media people will get
seeds after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, Cannabuzz, some of the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely my Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely getting moved up when it's time
for testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of them because they're serious
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're listening to the show,
so I know they're going to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, especially after this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're serious about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing it correctly because they're
serious and they're doing the Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I trust they're going to grow these
seeds in a great way and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testers come from social media,
forums, and my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose testers for a few different
reasons and with a few different criteria
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the same thing from every
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I choose different testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first goal of outside testing is to
see what I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about that I know what to
expect in my grow because I know the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we in these notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I skipped some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so when when I'm sending these out,
I need growers of different skill sets
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in different varieties of rooms,
different types of nutrients, different
[SPEAKER_00]: mediums, different lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word that wouldn't come into my
head and I'm looking right into these
[SPEAKER_00]: bright lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need people growing under LED lights,
HPS lights, CMH lights, all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what my new plants do under
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal is to see how these plants
react in your environment in different
[SPEAKER_00]: growers environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect some of you guys to abuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect some of you guys to treat them
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect some of the rooms to not be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope somebody gets spider mites in the
middle of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hoping you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope somebody else gets spider mites in
the middle of the grow while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: testing my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can find out how these plants
react to spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they mite resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to get invaded with mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got four different plants in the
room, does one specific strain get
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted to the mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the mites love that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of shit that I want to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're growing them,
I want to see if you see any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants just sloppy and shitty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we make a bunch of problematic plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any intersex traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things we're really
looking for, intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants throw nanners, if they're
intersex at all, I want to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, those aren't good to give
out as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to not pass that seed line on if
we get a bunch of intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I make a bunch of mutants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're playing with genetics,
two plants that come from different parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world or nowadays, two fucking
polyhybrid plants, that have just been
[SPEAKER_00]: bred from things that have been bred from
other things that not a lot of thought may
[SPEAKER_00]: have been put into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got ahold of them now and I like the
plant, so I'm breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the opportunity to make a bunch
of shitty mutants, and I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've thrown those seeds away, but we've
got to test them and find out if we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe under my lights, they grew
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe under your light, they express some
weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotypical expression may be
different in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main goal is to make winners that
outperform both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a female plant and I say,
ooh, there's traits to that female that I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of males to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also can reverse things so I can see a
lot of different opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to make something better than
both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't make something better than both
parents, I don't feel like I should pass
[SPEAKER_00]: it on to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a bunch of level eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take two level eights and I try to make
a level 10 or an 11 or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't come out with at least a solid
9.5, I don't pass it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everything that I do put out
is a solid 9.5, at least a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm aiming for 11s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants those 12s, but let's be
realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for shit that outperforms the
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that I see that in your garden,
not just in mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, in my garden,
it's really easy to see what these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can predict it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that when I put red and blue
together, I should get purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I add a little bit more red,
I'm going to get more reddish purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the tone that that's going to
be, but you know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know I've worked with these
ingredients so many times, I know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: put them together and make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should know how to run these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going with testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I expect from you, what I'm asking
from you is to let me know what these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they work in your environment,
in your grow style, in your media?
[SPEAKER_00]: In exchange, you get super cool,
new, free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people get testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of people get them, but if you
think about the overall seed market,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of people get these testers
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the first drop of brand new
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else around you is going to have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully only one or two people in your
neighborhood got these.
[SPEAKER_00]: One or two people in your group,
you can kind of ... I encourage people to
[SPEAKER_00]: show off my testers too, so that gives you
a whole new, some Instagram clout,
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit to show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about who I need as testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track on my
notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do I need as testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need photographers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what I'm doing with testers is
I'm looking for photos to put on my
[SPEAKER_00]: website for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They end up on SeedsHereNow, seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They end up on all the other vendor
websites so that you can see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want multiple people to take photos so
we can get a realistic view of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, the bud structures,
the plant structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take the picture of the single
finest plant out of a batch of 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could spend all year just growing seeds
of one strain and find the perfect plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and take pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could post it and I could say that's the
most beautiful picture of Lady Marmalade
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever strain we want to use in as
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could say that's the most beautiful
picture ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should pick a realistic example of the
plants by letting other people post the
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and share the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't send them specially selected
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent them seeds right out of the batch
that will go out for everybody else if the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds do pass testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want photographers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could take good photos of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to take the best photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they're my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got basically unlimited seeds so I
could just grow as many of those seeds as
[SPEAKER_00]: I want until I find the perfect photo and
then post that one up and say that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: prized photo, but that's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to see what's really coming out
of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want photographers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need website and advertising photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need new growers who will grow their
plants their full ability, but also kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of abuse the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some staggered notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers that are going to slightly abuse
the plants are also the growers who are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be buying these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower and you're going to
kind of abuse them, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: try your best, but you're going to
accidentally make mistakes, I like that
[SPEAKER_00]: because then I find if the plants can
handle stress, can they handle problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: can they handle resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, people are going to get
powdery mildew and spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often those new growers that struggle
with that and we'll find out how these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants react to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those stressful situations are also where
we're going to find intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My environments are nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to find a lot of intersex
problems here unless I ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go messing with the light cycles and
shit, then I see weird things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my rooms are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My environment, my temperature,
anywhere I work, anywhere I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, I've got a lot of equipment where
it stays nice unless the power goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to see those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see them in those weird
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need photographers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need new growers who will try their
best, but may accidentally cause some
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I need pro growers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pro growers are going to push these plants
to their full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see the potential harvest
weight, the potential potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want people that can get them
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get them lab tested in a lab,
the finished product, that's one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So new growers, pro growers,
photographers, people enthusiastic,
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiastic about cannabis, and then
people who can follow instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I really need is people
that can follow instructions and
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate with me on at least a weekly
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk a lot about that in
this episode, the communication that I
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I should say is I'm not
looking for people who want free seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: people who want to give me a shout out on
social media for free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm looking for is people are going
to test these seeds under the criteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give a pretty clear criteria,
and that's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want established growers that have got a
routine or a new grower who's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a routine, some sort of system,
not a bunch of experimental stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about what I expect from a
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect quick grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want to get, and this is cool
if that's your way to do it, but when you
[SPEAKER_00]: first get a seed and you grow that seed,
you don't know if it's going to be a male
[SPEAKER_00]: or a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know if it's going to be a
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know if it's going to be
intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know if it's going to be shit
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could just, anything, even if I bred
it, it could still be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking a gamble with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want quicker grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people grow these giant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start off, they just grow this brand
new seed and they grow it in a seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot and grow it five feet tall and
top it eight times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, what if it's a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know if that's a boy settled
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want quick grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are tester plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't play with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them in there, turn them and burn them
is what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't grow them out in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste your time and your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to waste your time and
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't excessively top them and train them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spread them out and do weird shit to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe get them big enough to where you can
take one, maybe three clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to take the top,
if that's your style, take the top out,
[SPEAKER_00]: take two clones off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you see roots on those clones,
start flowering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I don't even take a clone
off of a tester because if it's that good,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can re-veg it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you really get something that's
amazing and you didn't take a clone from a
[SPEAKER_00]: tester, it's most likely that I will send
you another pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that phenotype again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe do one top to get the shape you
need, but don't go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to see what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go topping and manipulating it and
training it and twisting it, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do different shit than it normally would
do if you just let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what these plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost be kind of scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do any experimental shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a familiar feed and a familiar light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an established grower,
don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't swap.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these, I'm going to try using this
plasma light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same light you've been doing
forever so that you know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: No variables this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only variables should be my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the variable in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's something I really ask for
when you are running testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about it, we'll have a
conversation before you get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll email, we'll talk on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will establish how many seeds are going
to be sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer you to run all of those seeds at
one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop them all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same thing to every single one of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get 10 seeds, germinate the 10
seeds in your germination method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplant them your way, but do the same
thing to all 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a scientific approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same thing, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you go doing things,
not just run them all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that, but that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplant them at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put recharge on one of them,
put recharge on 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do recharge on half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't top half of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do the same thing to all 10 of your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get six, do it to all six.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one phenotype is going to grow tall
and stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will grow short and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is going to grow wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to know that if you top
them all excessively?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to know the difference if
you fed one a bunch of recharge and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: feed this one recharge?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one with recharge is obviously going
to root out harder, do more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a fair test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a fair fight here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to see what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them all the same thing, the same
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't release the seeds until they have
been tested thoroughly by myself and by my
[SPEAKER_00]: testing team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, that is you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm relying on you to test them,
take pictures of them, give me reports so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can get them to the market,
to the other people who've been watching
[SPEAKER_00]: your photos who've been drooling over
them, because I don't put anything out
[SPEAKER_00]: until it is thoroughly tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It frustrates the shit out of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see you running testers and they're
like, come on, I want that, I want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm waiting for three more
people to give me your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I got 10 people that say they were
hot fire and zero reports of shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it kind of quickly, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a good job, you become already
added to the list of potential testers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a good job with this round of
testers, the next time I need testers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even send out the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, well, let's find 10 people from this
one and send it to them first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the first batch of the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testers go out in waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let people get them in veg, get them
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go drop off testers at friend's houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go out in waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shipping's kind of expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it all on priority mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also hard to keep up with everybody
when you do it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do them in little waves and little
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember group one got this,
group two got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a really good job and you didn't
keep clones, like I said before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may get more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you more shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tested stuff and you ran out and
you didn't keep a clone, I'll give you
[SPEAKER_00]: more seeds, but I'd prefer to give you new
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just expect new shit from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I keep saying I want, excuse me,
I'm not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a drink of water and keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying there are a lot of things I
want you to report back to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate with me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are a lot of the things I want you to
take notes on and communicate to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect weekly communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me pictures weekly, even in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what they look like when
they're little itty babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see my babies as they grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me germination pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many seeds germinated?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many looked like shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many did you get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how many you got so we can
know the ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got 100 seeds and four did not
germinate, that's not bad numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got five and four didn't germinate,
we got to throw those seeds away or figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what you did wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some of the things that I want
you to communicate with me and take
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed notes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so when you start emailing me
or sending me your test strain report,
[SPEAKER_00]: always include what strain you are
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay on top of it, know who's got
what, but I've got multiple testers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please remind me what strain you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to know things like,
simply how are you growing your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in soil or soil-less mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a no-till environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in your pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in big beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in small pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in one gallons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in three gallons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a big room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing in a tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here are the fun details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of lights are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of cobs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know a lot about LEDs,
but tell me because I like to know all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff because people ask me in the
future, how do they do under these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can go back and look and I can say,
well, tester ABB grew them under those and
[SPEAKER_00]: they did a hell of a job or they didn't
look so good under those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get reports about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing under high pressure
sodiums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing under ceramic metal
halides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing under those?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the other lights I can't even
think of right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasmas, ceramic metal halides,
LEDs, HPS, high pressure sodiums,
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a lot of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of lights are you growing under?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get my damn point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the pH of your feed solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the plants responding to those
feeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the temperature and humidity of
your environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that always tells me a
lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants look clawed out and it's
too hot in there, or if it's too wet in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, that'll tell me something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the plants, it's the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how are they reacting to those
environmental factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also I wanna know germination rates,
male to female ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I gave you regular seeds, even if I
gave you fem seeds, what's the ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: male to female plants out of the plants
you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any intersex plants and how
many?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the ratio of intersex plants to
non-intersex plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the week that you found intersex
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were growing the plants and some
intersex plants came up, what week did you
[SPEAKER_00]: determine that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, how many plants made it to the
flowering room?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you planted 10 plants and you
eliminated some because they were males,
[SPEAKER_00]: you eliminated some just because you
didn't like them, how many made it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any issues in the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I always wanna know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find botrytis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you overfeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you underfeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a power outage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did something go wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things will play a factor in
the appearance and performance of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to know that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're saying, hey, Jeff's acting
really weird lately, I don't know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you find out that like,
if again, all day long these lights are in
[SPEAKER_00]: my face, you'd go, well yeah, he's going
fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of those fucking lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you went, I don't know,
man, everything seems fine with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just think I'm losing my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these bright lights right here in your
face all day would make you go fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you knew that, that may play a
different, you may know, you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the solution to why things are going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me know what's happening in that
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you had any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you're putting the bright
light in the plants face all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna find my spot on these notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the plants react to the issues
that it encountered?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got spider mites, did it love them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it hate them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it easy to treat for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you treated for them, how did the
plants respond to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there other plants in this grow with
the testers?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did those plants look overall compared
to my tester plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they look amazing next to my plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did my plants look like shit next to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did my plants look amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I look better than your other plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do my plants look better than yours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how did those plants, here's the
important part, how did those plants react
[SPEAKER_00]: to the same issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got spider mites, did my plants
handle it better than the plants that you
[SPEAKER_00]: got from another breeder that you're
familiar with?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they react?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got more questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they compare overall in your
overall grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just overall, how did they perform?
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the overall yield, the
performance, the potency, the flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the main question that I'd like to
ask my testers is, would you buy these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Had you not been gifted these seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had paid retail price for these
seeds, would you have said, damn,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a good investment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you have said, shit, I just
wasted that much money on seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and electricity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I understand, as a breeder,
as a fellow grower, I know that it costs
[SPEAKER_00]: money to just to turn on the fucking
light, to buy the light costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs money just to plug it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every second that light's running,
there's money coming out of your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta buy nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta buy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs money just to have that plant in
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna know, as a breeder,
would you have been happy to pay money for
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you have just came back and
thrown the fucking root ball at me and
[SPEAKER_00]: been like, fuck these plants, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest with me, as a breeder,
as a grower, as a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I need from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we gonna go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I have a lot more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really like weekly updates and photos
and as much data as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, I don't know if you
want this info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want that info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any info you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think differently than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got different ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want your information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see anything weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would like a flavor and aroma and
smoke report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what it was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the flavors and aromas change out
throughout the growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it'll start off sweet and end up
funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it'll start funky and end up
sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it smells like vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like poop in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it smells like poop and it turns
into vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then send me photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want photos and more photos and then
more photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want your style of photos, however you
take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then try to get me that really cool bud
shot photo that you see that I post for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the advertising and all my strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give me that cool bud shot photo
that looks amazing from the right angle,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes it look perfect, that is gonna
work well in magazines and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will use that on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, you always get gifts when I do
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lost on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to find myself here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how it smokes, flavor,
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you able to get it lab tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to get it lab tested,
I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you can get potency
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you can get terpene
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will definitely trade you more seeds in
return for your lab test because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: those tests are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expensive and it costs you some of
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta sacrifice a little bit of your
herb to give it to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send you more seeds for your lab
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then like I said before, my favorite
question is, would you buy these seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: again or would you have been satisfied if
you paid for these seeds out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't send them to you to test,
would you do it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you have felt like you got ripped
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a lot of the things I expect
that I require from a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk more about that when we
email back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some fine details.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I do like to stress is
please, please do not share or give away
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds or clones until I decide if
they are to be given away, shared,
[SPEAKER_00]: sold, or put out for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give out some stuff that is a
tester, it may not meet my standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're testing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've trusted you to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can post pictures of it, but let's not
spread it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our job is a cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job as a breeder is to put out good
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set up our fellow growers,
our friends, for success by giving them
[SPEAKER_00]: better genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my testers don't qualify, let's not
pass them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wait until I can send you some seeds
that are 10s instead of fucking 7s and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can pass out those 10s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just please wait until I've given you
permission, given you the go ahead to
[SPEAKER_00]: release clones or seeds of testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoard them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the only one with them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a medical grower, you've got the
best medicine around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a fucking black market or a free
market, whatever you wanna call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a profit grower, you've got the
only batch of these seeds around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself apart from the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't share this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you can to leverage the market
with this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're auditioning these seeds to see if
they make it to the fucking, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: casting couch, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna put them in front of the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we've auditioned them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanna find out if they are worth
introducing them to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't share them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please keep them close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been trusted with new shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't spread the new shit until
basically I'm gonna ask you to hold onto
[SPEAKER_00]: it until you officially see me release it
on the websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's on seedsherenow.com or the other
websites, then you've got the go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't make it there, I'm probably
gonna ask you to not share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that cut for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, when you say please,
please don't share that cut in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like French for give as many clones
of this fucking plant out as you can as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love you guys and I trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I select my tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the part where everybody
says, now how do we become a tester?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've told us what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you what I expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you how to communicate with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect you to grow them the best you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a scientific experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to see what you got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I expect you to communicate with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weekly reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know how many males and females
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know how many germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know if you got any weirdos out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many made it to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they got it to flower, did you see
any weird shit going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many got to finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your harvest weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a smoke report.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it smoke like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it taste like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of buzz did you get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wanna know how it dealt with
problems and issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you think I should know,
tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, hey, this happened and your plant
did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just act like it's my kids and you think I
should check on my kids and put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what the fuck is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then don't share the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a relationship with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me trust you and then you will be in
line to get more and more and more tester
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here is how you're going to be able
to get in line to be a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I know a lot of people are
waiting for this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanna know how they can become a
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked earlier that social media and the
forums and my group of friends are a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to find testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how everybody out there gets a fair
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to become a tester is to
email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email me at iregenetics at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me three photos of your grow that
make you think I would be impressed by
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow and make me want to allow you to
test my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's where we get specific with
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be able to follow
instructions to be a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where we start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the word tester application in the
subject line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tester application.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I already know what I'm looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm looking for testers, I could type
in search word tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tell me a little bit about your grow
and your grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing in soil-less mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing no-till?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of lights are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it gonna be in a commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it gonna be in a tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know where these seeds are gonna
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know what kind of fish tank you're
gonna put my pets in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tell me a little bit about your grow
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just how do you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tell me a little bit about your grow
history and your grow skill level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just auditioning, sending me a
short, brief resume about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tell me why you qualify to be a
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes you think that you qualify to
be a tester for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded very, sounded worse than it
was meant to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think you qualify to be a
tester?
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't sound as egotistical as it
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me know why you think you qualify
to test my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then include your social media name and
handles so that I can creep on all your
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff but not click like on anything so
you never know I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your Cannabuzz handle up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your Instagram handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rarely go look at your YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are like, look at my
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your Instagram and Cannabuzz up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very likely that I'll go check those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things, I won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube, I gotta watch the video scroll
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna wait for your video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, I can look and I can scroll as
quickly as I want and I can decide quite
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly if your photos are what I want for
my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'll wrap that up one more
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send three photos to iregeneticsathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the words tester application in the
subject line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about your grow and
your grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about your grow
history and your grow skill level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about your lights, your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know what kind of nutrients you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tell me why you qualify to be a
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then include your social media credentials
so I can creep on you and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: not click like on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click like on any of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like all kinds of people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like stuff when you post pictures of
other breeder's plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even click like on that because if you
post cool pictures, you deserve a damn
