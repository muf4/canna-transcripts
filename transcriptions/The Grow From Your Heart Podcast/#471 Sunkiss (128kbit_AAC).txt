[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 471 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by talking
about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Halo Live
Batter from our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Headbanger and Infinity OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the container, the flavor is described
as deconstructed sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've talked about this on the
show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the hell deconstructed
sour diesel is supposed to taste like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that this concentrate smells
deliciously disgusting and it makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid when I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am completely enjoying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious Halo Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to do a strain
review or a strain report on one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get there, I would like to do
some shout outs to a couple of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: on Patreon.

you to everybody who has supported the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon campaign in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the present and in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, let's not waste
too much time in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that I wanted to do a strain
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about one of my favorite
strains that I have bred, also a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that is getting really popular lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a cross that I call
Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Sunkiss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss is a cross of a female platinum
tangy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum tangy comes from our friends at
the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Maddie and Spence and the
entire team Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a fist bump to everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you scratch them dogs on the
head for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the platinum tangy is,
of course, a platinum cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a platinum Girl Scout cookies
female pollinated by a male tangy plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that was named Julius.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was selected by Spence from the
Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they pollinated the platinum cookies
with the pollen from Julius and that
[SPEAKER_00]: created the platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The platinum tangy is a wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came across this plant in a commercial
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been selected by somebody else,
but they did a great job with the
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very good representation of both
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had that cookies growth, the cookies
potency, but had that stink and that vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't take too long to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant was very pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always gave impressive test results,
impressive harvest, and the aromas and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors were very unique, very orange
dominant flavors in that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Spence and Maddie did a wonderful job
breeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever did the phenotype selection did a
wonderful job with the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came across it in a commercial facility
and quickly fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired a cut and I introduced that cut
of the platinum tangy into my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I began playing with it and I've bred it
to several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we are going to talk about
breeding it to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows I work with a strain
called Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise comes from a golden goat female
pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is not a well-known strain,
so we'll talk about daybreaker briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is a Chem D female pollinated
by a Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got Chem Dog and O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super stinky, super funky, really nice
vigorous growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fat wide leaves, kind of short stocky
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that pollen onto a golden goat
female that made crazy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tests really high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows with hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a wonderful plant to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aromas and flavors are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male out of my Arise breeding
project that I have named King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made many crosses from King Solomon
and they all have proven to be tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything Solomon touches, it just improves
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant in this case that
makes amazing orange turps and is very
[SPEAKER_00]: pest and pathogen resistant and is very
easy to grow, you pollinate it with
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon and all of those traits were
amplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has more rapid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems to improve everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took my prized King Solomon,
my Arise male plant, and I sprinkled that
[SPEAKER_00]: magic dust all over that female Platinum
Tangi and that created what I have called
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sure you can assume with a name
like Sunkiss we are going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous orange dominant turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the most noticeable things
about this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus more on the growth
characteristics of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Platinum Tangi cross to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Platinum Tangi plant stays fairly
short.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Platinum Tangi plant didn't get real
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have a giant main cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows fairly even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a dominant main apical top
but it wasn't that giant glory bud like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of plants get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the buds stayed even and uniform
which makes it great for a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of why I selected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred it to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise is known to grow very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get kind of tall on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured this would even out that
shortness to that hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add them together and it would
just make a normal speed growth plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: it worked beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the phenotypes that come from the
Sunkiss stay shorter and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: wider and when you flower them they don't
have that amazing stretch that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of plants when you flip them into
flower for about three weeks they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really going to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sunkiss does not stretch as hard as a
lot of other plants so that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous for most grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does grow a little bit wider than some
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a little bit more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If most of the time you give your plants a
two foot center you may need a three foot
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're giving them a four you may need
a six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're starting with six you may need
to go eight feet with a Sunkiss plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a little bit wider
growth than what you're used to but that
[SPEAKER_00]: is great because that means more
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are limited by plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants we can grow is dictated by
our local government, by our local medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis laws if you're a personal home
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to keep the numbers low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a plant that branches out like this
and produces really well is really
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they stay a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get as tall as many of the
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However they will get a little bit wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will branch out but they will not
stretch as rapidly at the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes Sunkiss a really good plant for
something you want to trellis out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working a screen that is a
really great plant for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just screen it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll fill that screen real well then put
a second screen about 12 to 16 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: above that and it'll fill right into that
net.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a commercial environment put
up another net because it's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: right into that net.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got those gavitas banging it
will grow into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to stay shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get a little bit wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to stretch on you
ridiculously tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have that major apical
dominant top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something that grows even
canopy more easily so you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that main top out if you're not into
topping this is a great plant for that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: However when you do top it that bitch will
really take off and branch out extra hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great plant for outdoor and
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people ask me what would you
recommend for an outdoor environment or a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse from your lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start off with the Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a regular seed I should
mention this is not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this comes from King Solomon this is
not a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a feminized version.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is known as Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is currently sold out but it will be
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out the Michelangelo if you need
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask me my recommendation
on outdoor strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend the Sunkiss because she
doesn't take nearly as long to finish as a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of my other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people email me and say hey dude
this plants been going 45 or 50 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: she looks done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say send me pictures of the
trichomes and without a doubt those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were done at 45 or 50 days outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants are great for outdoor or
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very pathogen and pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason the spider mites don't
really seem to like the orange turps that
[SPEAKER_00]: come from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunkiss is a great selection for either
a new grower or somebody who is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in an outdoor environment or in a
greenhouse environment or a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends are on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People up in the Pacific Northwest or up
on the East Coast they were saying hey
[SPEAKER_00]: what can I grow outdoors this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recommending the Sunkiss along with
a couple of other things but I like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss because it doesn't get powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tends to finish before people are
going to have outdoor problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus more on a few growth
characteristics and then we'll move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: She won't get too tall on you but she will
get kind of wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will not stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will flower in less time than most of
my other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that most phenotypes will be
done around eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some outliers that will be done
earlier and some that will be done later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before I was getting reports
of this strain being done at 45 and 50
[SPEAKER_00]: days outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen this plant go 65 or 70 days
indoors so it just depends on your
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype and we're going to talk about
that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the opportunity of finding
early finishing phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you grow a crop indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a good one for the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that early finisher outdoor and grow
the shit out of that next year outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a bunch of clones of that one out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is setting yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some early finishing
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say eight to nine weeks on most
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them will finish around eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, if I say that this plant
will finish at seven weeks, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to expect it to be done at the end
of seven weeks and they will email me when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: More typically you're going to see eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will go nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very untypically but there will be some
that will go 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about Sunkiss is that
she clones very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're cloning in a cube, if you're
cloning in rapid rooters, however you take
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones, you will have great success
with Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is very easy to clone and I believe
that that comes from the Platinum Tangi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant just clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just cut clones of it and set them
on the table and they will make roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Spence for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that Platinum Tangi makes it super
easy to clone the Sunkiss plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just spits out roots no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow with great vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant will make robust stalks very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These stalks get super thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to transplant these plants
earlier than you're used to transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to speed up your schedule by
about one full week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with good lighting and
good soil and you've got proper nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know what you're doing,
you could probably speed up your entire
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle by one full week by running
something with the vigor that comes with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sunkiss plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It clones really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's PM resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very unlikely to find powdery
mildew on a Sunkiss plant indoors or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see powdery mildew on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my favorite traits about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is partly why I recommend it to an
indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it does not get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find bugs on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody ever sends me a picture saying,
hey, there are bugs on this Sunkiss plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get pictures of bugs on all other
strains, but not Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something that I think is
really advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, this plant will
work great for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any intersex traits in this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never seen a photo of a
hermaphroditic Sunkiss plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is great for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is also great for outdoor growers
or greenhouse growers because it can
[SPEAKER_00]: really handle stress and mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also likes a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed this shit out of a Sunkiss
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one friend who grows this plant
in all organic, no-till type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and he crushes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces delicious orange crazy turps
and the plants are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown this in a commercial
environment using all veg bloom and
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial salty nutrients and it crushes
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts out giant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen all kinds of different
environments really win with the Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is an easy plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a beginner or if you just need a
break, if you're tired of struggling,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an easy one to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one kind of goes on autopilot if you
know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't seem to get too upset if you
miss a feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't seem to get too upset if you
overfeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one great thing is she really doesn't
mind if you fuck up the pH a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to encourage you to go in
there and not adjust the pH, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not the best grower, if you're kind of
lazy and you're kind of not checking your
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, you're not going to mess up the crop
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I've seen some lazy growers,
some new growers and some pro growers all
[SPEAKER_00]: crush it with Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she will get some pretty big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier that she doesn't get that
big apical dominant bud, but she's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow some long branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bottom branches are going to reach
to the top, so they may need some
[SPEAKER_00]: supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I should recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend, I like growing with the
trellis, like with the net with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: layers of netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not an option for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your environment, you may need a tomato
cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tomato cage is great because the plants
are going to bush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can fall right into that tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull some branches down and strap
them to the cage, or you can use sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of spread this plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of defoliate kind of heavily and
let a lot of sunshine get into the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to clean too far down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottoms of this plant are going to
make fat buds also, so don't clean too far
[SPEAKER_00]: down as long as you get light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the light goes, you will get
buds with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes will give you what I like
to call taco leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they're getting too warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think those plants are always too
warm when I see that taco leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is just something in the
genetics because I've seen it in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good thing about that taco leaf is it
is usually just encrusted with trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your smaller leaves, not your fan
leaves, but the secondary leaves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the buds will just kind of
curl up just a little bit, and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just coat themselves in trichomes at the
edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be worried if you see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do have to watch for is the tips
of the leaves starting to look like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're crisping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you're giving it too much
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think you're giving the plant
just enough nutrient when you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it getting their nails done.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see the tips starting to cook,
you know you've given it just to its
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to go, hey boss,
do I really have to work this hard?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you can go, okay, that's your
limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how far you can go, and you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a difference between stress,
between too much heat, and between just
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing those taco resin rails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting a little bit of a fold
and a bunch of trichomes coming across
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you are not overheating those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are loving life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a trait of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now talking about traits, let's move
toward talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are fairly uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see Platinum Tangi dominant
phenotypes, and then we're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, like I was talking about
earlier, are going to be a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got short squat plants that grow kind
of wide with a lot of vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get some that are a little
taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get some that show a
little bit of stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, they're going to be
dense, wide plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotype differences are
going to express themselves in aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get straight up oranges,
like a basket of fresh, delicious oranges
[SPEAKER_00]: that somebody cut one open right in the
middle so it smells real citrusy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a real orange dominant
type of a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to get sort of a gassy,
funky orange phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's oranges and feet, and that's coming
from the Daybreaker, which is coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things, coming from the ChemDog
side of things, putting a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: musty foot into that orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's maybe like if you got to eat a
slice of oranges from somebody's dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: feet, which when it comes to cannabis,
that's a fucking ideal sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there was another phenotype that is a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little, I call it a sharper of an
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit more of an orange rind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like you bit too far down into
the orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have eaten that far,
and it tastes a little bit bitter,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still real citrusy and it's still
really sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one smells a little bit funky on its
own, but it makes amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates don't come out with that
bitter, smell they come out super jolly
[SPEAKER_00]: rancher orange candy sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if you've got that astringent,
funky orange grapefruit sort of a smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: one in the beginning, it is going to turn
into straight up orange candies when it
[SPEAKER_00]: dries and cures or when you make
concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype is identifiable because it
is taller and has skinnier leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be the grapefruit
flavored phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that that comes from the Golden
Goat side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is either the island
sweet skunk or possibly the Romulan doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that there's a grapefruit
characteristic in the island sweet skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: a sweet pink grapefruit turp that is just
hidden back in there, somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unlock it occasionally when I cross the
Golden Goat to other things, it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cross the Arise to other things,
that turp comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that's coming from the
Golden Goat, from the island sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a grapefruit sweet pink grapefruit
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll smell that in flower, you'll smell
that in the drying cure process and that
[SPEAKER_00]: will drop out and it becomes complete
orange Jolly Rancher candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like orange powder, not like orange
juice, but that's sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you put a Jolly Rancher in your
mouth and your tongue gets wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, that's orangey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is that sort of orangey sort of a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make good concentrates out of
that, if you can make a good BHO or a good
[SPEAKER_00]: live batter, or I'm not dissing whatever
you're doing, I like a good BHO
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it really brings out a good
clean, turp profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really taste that orange candy
just chilling on your tongue and just
[SPEAKER_00]: dances around for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the taller phenotype is what's going to
make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I got distracted by enjoying that
pheno flavor in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking for that grapefruit,
turp dominant phenotype, you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: taller one with the skinnier, longer
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I believe that comes from the
island sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want just the straight orangey
turps, I believe that comes from the one
[SPEAKER_00]: with the more compact leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves stay really close to the plant
the pedials don't get really long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got the one with the purple
pedials, you've probably got the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: has got a little bit of foot to it because
those long purple pedials are a trait of
[SPEAKER_00]: the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you're going to get the
foot aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are probably the three different
phenotypes you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find the straight oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find oranges and gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to get the
astringent grapefruit rind, kind of orange
[SPEAKER_00]: peel oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all beautiful in their own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find some different combos of
different things therein, but I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: will be happy with any phenotype you get
of Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never gotten any bad reviews or
negative feedback on Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a seed maker, as a breeder who has
put out a lot of seeds, I do get feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it, unfortunately,
is negative, but that's how you improve a
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you improve a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be some type of
negative feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never get any negative feedback from
Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked about the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of talked about the flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just orange candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those orange tic tac sort of
flavors, not as much like orange tang,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more fresh oranges, gassy oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that straight up Jolly Rancher
sweet, delicious, drooly kind of orange
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the flavors you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the buzz
from Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask me for advice on
flowers or concentrates that would reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety or kind of calm them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people get too high and they get
anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get anxious when they smoke or
they're already experiencing anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want something that will help
them in a social situation just to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more, a little more available for
social activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us don't want to go out until we
smoke and then it kind of makes your brain
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go be around more people,
be more social.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask me for that type of a
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often recommend Sunkiss for that type of
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkiss will give you a nice, friendly,
smiley buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be around other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't give you that I hate
society kind of vibe that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of seem to wake up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also just puts a smile on your face and
it'll give you a nice buzz without making
[SPEAKER_00]: you anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're prone to getting anxiety when
you smoke, something about the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: turps are real calming, are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put you in a friendly mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just friendly orange turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't describe it any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few people that when they
smell oranges, they say that is
[SPEAKER_00]: unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the planet really enjoys an orange
fragrant turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that is really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fruity sort of turps make almost
everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange smell just puts everybody in a
good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smoke those orange turps,
it really just lifts you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a good breakfast dab or a good
breakfast joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for something to
smoke during the day that's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bog you out, that's not going to make you
too stupid, that's going to keep you
[SPEAKER_00]: peppy, going to keep your brain moving,
going to keep you social, keep you
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're looking for cannabis that you
can smoke that doesn't make you too
[SPEAKER_00]: anxious, because a lot of people get that
anxiety, you take a dab, and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: start, oh shit, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will not give you dab anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should not give you smoke anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something that is great for
breakfast smoke, for daytime smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun Kiss is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to go talk to people and
you're not really in the mood to be around
[SPEAKER_00]: people, if you got to maybe work somewhere
where you got to deal with customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun Kiss just may put a smile on your face
that you might not have had when you
[SPEAKER_00]: started the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my brief report on Sun Kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I would usually talk about
problems and struggles you would run into
[SPEAKER_00]: while growing this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this plant is such a breeze to grow
that I really don't think you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I don't get negative feedback
on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem you will have with Sun
Kiss is that if you leave the jar around,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody will smoke all of your buds
because that shit smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, that is my story
and I am sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to add some Sun Kiss
seeds to your garden, I've got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: sources I can suggest for you.
