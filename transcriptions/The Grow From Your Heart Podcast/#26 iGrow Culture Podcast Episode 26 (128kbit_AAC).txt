getting a little bit wrecked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm with you on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having fun tonight trying to record
this episode.

[SPEAKER_03]: Much respect to all of our sponsors for
making the show possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really appreciate you guys for helping us
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get right down to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse came over for a grow lesson,
taught us a lot of stuff about outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam hung out and learned a few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna let the music play for a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna go ahead and fade in that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, Adam and I will be
back to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, guys.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, they're just gonna fucking
stick my iPhone in my head and I can just
[SPEAKER_03]: think like text Adam and tell him to come
over and take dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're recording now just so that you
guys are aware.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your next thought would be a little weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just here having a little random
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna have a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Jesse back as promised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Adam's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on the show all the time,
but you guys might not know that Adam's a
[SPEAKER_03]: new grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of new to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his first grow season here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he does have some outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I invited him to stick around while
Jesse's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He may have some good outdoor questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: He may bring up some shit that we may
overlook.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always good to have a new guy in
to kind of referee us because been told
[SPEAKER_03]: we're kind of snobs and we go a little
fast and we talk about shit like everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: should know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll slow down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to go slow for you guys and keep
it at a pace where you can keep up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do plan to increase the knowledge in
this show slowly but surely over time so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you guys can all improve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your grow to the next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_03]: That came from Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never stop learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be the smartest thing Adam's
gonna say all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys said I was too loud in the
headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna turn that shit up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you were too loud in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, we're back for an outdoor
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full bloom time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants should be starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocking and rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocking and rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Signs of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you guys have pulled your mails.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to pull the mails now,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's past time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way, way past time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't pulled your mails,
you've got a seeded crop and your
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbors have a seeded crop and someone
else on the block has a seeded crop and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're all pissed off at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully you pulled your mails by now
because you're in full bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means we're probably 25,
30 days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's pulling out a calendar is why we have
a little bit of silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some strange okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam was saying he had one that took a
long time to switch into flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just now getting to the point where
it's like visibly flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably switched last week or so
officially, but it had definitely taken...
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be a little bit longer,
but the other two had switched into flower
[SPEAKER_05]: three or four weeks ago, obviously,
and now have decent sized, quarter sized
[SPEAKER_05]: buds.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's about where I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a random question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long since you're an outdoor grower?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an inexperienced outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a city boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't worry too much about the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a city boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you take me to the sticks and I'm
fucking scared, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a gun to fucking protect myself out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't jump at everything,
I'm like, what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fucking life, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I gonna ask you now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long do we have?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many weeks or about when do you expect
frost?
[SPEAKER_03]: When does it get too cold for our outdoor
crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good question if I know
the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not Mother Nature, are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed... Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, would you agree that in Colorado,
in Pueblo, Colorado, nature loves to snow
[SPEAKER_03]: on Halloween and fuck up all the kids'
costumes on Halloween?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of our traditional... Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get them down October 30th.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll start to be able to tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys...
For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: First cold snap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna grab a calendar right quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna see how many weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just ask Siri.
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll tell me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Siri is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta use... How many days until
Halloween?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Siri's been a not friendly chick today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many days until Halloween?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's looking.
It's 70 days until then.
[SPEAKER_03]: 70 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so most trains should be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even your stuff that just started
flowering should be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: 70 days from... So today is actually
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: This show won't go up until Monday
morning, so you're gonna have closer to
[SPEAKER_03]: 65.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you probably won't listen till
Wednesday, so... For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting down nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got about nine weeks to flower,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on where you are, if you're in
California, you could get that shit out,
[SPEAKER_03]: no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're in Colorado, you got about
nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're higher up, if you're towards
Denver, you may wanna cut that little
[SPEAKER_03]: closer to Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, folks in California have been
flowering longer than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the pictures I've seen, they
definitely went into flower sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine several things why that
would be, but I wonder what the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: reason is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they've selected better
strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send all hate mail to...
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if the coast, maybe just their
different region.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at a different latitude and
longitude in the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: North and south makes a huge difference.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the sun at a slightly different
angle or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, if somebody understands why those
plants in Cali flowered sooner,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we just nailed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you got the sciencey reason,
tweet that to me, email it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to understand more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agriculture on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get it, but we want you to explain it
because we're podcast hosts and stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to understand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked Jesse when he got here,
we took a bunch of dabs, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we talked about what we wanted to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: He talked about top dressing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you wanna talk about the mulching and
the top dressing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's safe to say to go ahead and
switch over all your top dressings and
[SPEAKER_00]: your tees and stuff to throw in that high
P stuff, high PK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much chill out on the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam's got some plants that are nitrogen
deficient visibly on the lower... Lower
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lower third of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him to hit it real good with
nitrogen one more time, real hard for his
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna show this mic a little more to
your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting Jesse trained on podcast
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll be a lot more audible now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just noticed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you're way... I gotta compliment
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're way more comfortable, way more
fluid on the show now compared to the
[SPEAKER_03]: first episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you were on number eight or six.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was number eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're at 26 now, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've been coming quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give you a little foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locally, just to that part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: High nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several different ways you could do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My option is basically to put grow in a
bottle and spray it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really dilute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, that's my problem is I'm a
little underfeeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you gave me the chart and I've
just been basically going off of that
[SPEAKER_05]: besides all the added negatives that I
should have gotten probably by now that I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told Adam to buy a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Well, now you can see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a new grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a budget to allocate to
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a family.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm learned, too, to chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn to take nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to avoid the word chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to be so, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chemicals is a scary word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nutrients is a safe word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I steered clear of Miracle Grow on
the East Coast because... But try to...
[SPEAKER_03]: When you harvest this, try to either...
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a patient friend that needs
some medicine or I don't know the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: straight way to do that, but save the
money that you normally would have gone to
[SPEAKER_03]: your caregiver or your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Save that money next year because you're
going to have your own pot because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it and buy those bottles that you
could not get this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make your shift a little bit better next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next year, a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then by the time you're just an
amateur grower, you don't need the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: rock star drum set yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time you're a good rock star,
you'll have a rock star set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's easier to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you learn better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I became a good grower because I started
with struggle bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started with a shitty setup and was
like, no, this sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then had to grow a whole crop through
that because you don't want to rebuild
[SPEAKER_03]: your room in the middle of a grow and then
bought the next upgrade and then
[SPEAKER_03]: realized...
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I've never had a room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always had a small box with plants in
it and then now it's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were never in a state where you could
just go to the grow shop and be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I need this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we could walk in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost feels like we're cheating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost too easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is cheating at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost too easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go back to top dressing
with mulch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be hooking them up with your
full bloom feed, like you were saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: pull back on the nitrogen, get your
phosphorus and potassium in there heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're mulching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain that to the guys that like,
fuck, I'll tell you, I'm retarded on
[SPEAKER_03]: mulching.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to mulch my yard and my trees
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we using for mulch for our weed
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using fresh green matter,
most of it's from the plant itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weed seed things I've been pulling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I've been... Well,
I've been mixing that with straw that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm building a mulch mound around the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably eight, 10 inches tall and
the circumference of the... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm picturing a coffee can is kind of what
I see a coffee can shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it's a fricking mound,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe closer to like 10 or 12 inches in
the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're coming out probably two feet in
circumference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I've removed part of it to apply
top dressing, the root growth that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen is just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil just looks better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as tight as it normally is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets when it's getting sunbaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always mulched a little bit,
but never to this extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just... So in nature, wouldn't leaves
fall off of a plant and kind of decompose
[SPEAKER_03]: for where the plant's growing and provide
that nutrient for next year?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes a lot of great sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever worry about heat with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I did initially because... It's
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing I have to... Yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why I've always kind of steered
away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But doing the big mound with... It's just
this work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be dry on top, but as I work down
into it, it's moist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've looked for something to keep the heat
off my soil because my soil is just baked
[SPEAKER_05]: and I tried sand because somebody was
like, I'll just put a layer of sand on
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went out there and my plants were
like... Sand choked them out good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't use sand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get rid of your dirt bugs with
sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it, use a really tiny,
tiny layer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make some diatination so it's into
your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reapply it every single time after you
water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gigantic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like we've kind of worked over
to one of the things that we wrote down to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're outdoor growing, it's been 90
something degrees in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much water?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Adam, I'll ask you first because
Jesse is gonna have a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kind of a new guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What size are your pots?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants, from what I see, look to be
about four feet tall?
[SPEAKER_03]: One's four foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two are right at my chin,
so about five foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just looking at pictures on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys haven't gone over there and looked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want a spider mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a gardener joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are razzling.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does not have bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in his hair.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the beneficial kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got four foot tall plants and five
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often and how much are you watering
those girls?
[SPEAKER_05]: Every day before the sun comes up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting the hose out and literally filling
it up to the top three different times.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the end of the day, they are dry and I
can pick them up with one hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys got to get on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you think, oh, I'll just wait until
noon.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you won't because you will go out
there and they will be sad pieces of lump.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll be like, oh my God,
what have I done?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've waited till nine or 10 and went out
there and they're screaming for water.
[SPEAKER_05]: So water your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Water your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try wrapping some white plastic around
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: White plastic.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll reflect the heat instead of retain
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get you a big good size mulch going.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing about the mulch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just pulled a whole bunch of weeds out
of my yard.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were tall and atrocious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could I just throw them in a bucket and
start mulching them?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm worried about bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the plant matter I can definitely
work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I'd be a little nervous
about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just grab any weeds and start
mulching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, I'm, you know, select about
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: My weeds are actually morning glory seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and if anyone knows anything about
morning glory, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly, highly invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easy to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much water?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: How big are your plants outdoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I even ask you to, I can avoid
questions you don't want to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing like, uh, uh, six to eight
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, each one's probably minimum of four
foot in circumference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, they're the three of us to put our
arms together to get around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stocks as big as that water bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stocks are as big as my forearm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty gnarly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moved from plants to shrubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much, uh, how much water does a plant
that size take every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven and a half to 10 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 gallons a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Times however many plants he's got,
we won't even go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So de-chlorinated, filtered, aerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly what I was headed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be hauled in somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're out in a rural area,
because there's not enough water to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just coming out of your well,
sometimes you don't want to drain the
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have water for your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Piss your neighbors off real good too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the federal government regulates
most wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they can't know that you're.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real understanding of pot grows as
I understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're real inviting for that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've covered a lot about water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, there was a hum and I just found
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a squeal in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it only happened in my ears,
but it went blalalala just a minute ago
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was my headphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could have been my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's something we talked about
a few episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the federal government is banning
fucking water use for dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_03]: grows, which, uh, if they catch,
if a federal agent, if somebody for like
[SPEAKER_03]: the department of water works or somebody,
some of them that works in a federal
[SPEAKER_03]: agency discovers water in their
municipality being used for a cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to report the cannabis
grow in the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we talked about a few
episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wack shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys be super careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, try to be super discreet.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we talked a little bit about worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying that the worms were
crawling up into your mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means happy mulch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the worms get up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably eating those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're probably secreting their
enzymes all over those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, those leaves are breaking down and
becoming nutrients, uh, that are more
[SPEAKER_03]: bioavailable to the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a win-win situation for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just my headphones or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's like digital sound in my ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a telegraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fan on or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tripping out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the sound of part of this
equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this, uh, H a O four from live wire
solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked about it on the show before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it out completely?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about now?
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it sounds better in mine too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Hey, whatever channel I'm on solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice channel one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never did nothing throughout that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to listen to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This headphone app sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ever buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say the name of the company one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a live wire solutions H a O four four
channel stereo headphone amplifier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my anti sponsor right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys keep saying, won't you buy
something better?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well I bought this one and it keeps
breaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I go to guitar center and I say this
thing broke again and they just give me
[SPEAKER_03]: another one of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just cost me a trip to guitar center
every few weeks, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're cool over there and I always find
new toys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the company goes out of business
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get enough credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I recall, now you're thinking,
yeah, or at least some store credit on an
[SPEAKER_03]: upgrade or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's just random talk guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you enjoy hearing us talk about
random shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get messages that are like, just hang
out and talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love hearing you talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably want to hear me talk about
weed and not my piece of shit equipment,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worms are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put worms by, uh, the roots of your plants
all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if you find a warm, don't bury it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me re explain that and not stone or
talk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a worm and you want to put it
into your plant, um, don't bury it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gently put him on the surface and work in
his way down or it's wait in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sure yours are in the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So finding worms in your plants are one
thing, but should I go out and get some
[SPEAKER_05]: worms?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be beneficial at the beginning
of, you know, when I first put the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it would hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, uh, you're feeding bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of acids and salts in what
you're feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to wreak havoc on your.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've inadvertently had, uh, worms in
indoor plants before, but never purposely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, how about growing mushrooms in
your soil on accident?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those yellow mushrooms and pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of that in Colorado because of
the climate changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some, uh, crazy girl, girl,
Kashi compost going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about to start doing some
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to the probiotic farmers
Alliance, genetics, key play big,
[SPEAKER_04]: big love to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm really, really stoked about
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the stuff they grow with that looks
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, uh, I've been talking with Jesse
a lot about farming and stuff and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, talking to, not talking to,
but listening to a guy named Jim Frer on
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a excellent grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, he's a scientist dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a organic chemistry guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows a lot of things, uh, between all
you organic farmers and you outdoor guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm a vegetarian and I'm over there
chopping up pineapple, watermelon,
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries, kale, lettuce, onions,
tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: else you brought me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even get to look into the bag far
enough, but I chop up all that and every
[SPEAKER_03]: one of those has a piece that you chop off
and don't eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That little part where the stem comes out
or the little tip that's funky for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bananas have appeal.
[SPEAKER_03]: My avocado, I need a ton of avocados.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have appeal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always have some shitty brown spot in
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of throw that in the damn trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: A compost pile for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just try the, uh, the Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, um, what I've been doing is just a
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've got one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all veggie scraps, which would
be all greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've got another one I'm doing started
a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's half carbon, half greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, explain the carbon to the retards.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said retards because it was me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green greens are living things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon would be like, um, uh, peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose would be carbon, uh,
coconut or cocoa shell, um, dried up
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks, dried up leaves, peanut shells,
eggshells, um, but you have to have a 50
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you don't have to have, but to get
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just took that, um, a third cup,
a third of a cup of Grokashi mix that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucker in there, threw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, six days later, I mean, I can visually
see stuff turning into humate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a web of life in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, can you send one to my phone and then
let me tweet that from the show stuff for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tweet Jesse's pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing it and I've tried lots of
different styles of composting before,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is hands down the easiest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like it's right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'll be able to have fresh compost
all through the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can, can I put carrots and shit in
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that soil is ready to grow some shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's and just, and then just add that to
my root organic base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let it go for like a month is
kind of what I was reading from this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost sifted out if it needs to be,
which is like a quarter inch screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you just take it all, dump it on
there, sift it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll catch anything that's not composted
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything that comes through is
BAM is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I'm sold on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a quick rundown and I'm sold on
that two, five gallon buckets and some
[SPEAKER_03]: table scraps and a bag of grow Kashi and
you were making awesome compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a picture of a, this was day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of celery, some coffee
grounds are carbon too.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some asparagus in there or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a vegetarian and almost everything
I eat could go in.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've just, you always got something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always watermelon has Orion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberries have that little green thing
at the tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's got something, some sort of
waste to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bananas have appeal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was saying, everything comes off
the vine at some point and where usually
[SPEAKER_05]: where it comes off the vine, we,
as Americans don't eat that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not Nigerian meme.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could even experiment with some,
uh, you know, scraps from different grows
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good clean leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old stems could be my, uh, my fiber part,
my carbon part for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great idea, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys just learned something with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad we could all learn that together.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you do with your fan leaves
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end, yeah, that's what I do for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tempted to buy a juicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have another way of composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the easiest way of
composting I've ever discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I feed it to my chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, not everyone has that luxury.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shoot it out at high nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what was I about to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, uh, I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were so many things happening to my
brain just now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back on topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as various tastes like what it
tastes like snobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the stuff we're, uh, we're eating.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should think about what we put into
ourselves because that's what we should be
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding our plants kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to feed your plants,
watermelons, but like think about what's
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about your health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about your plant health.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you start paying attention,
you'll match up and you'll start feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you'll definitely pay attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that from the last show that you
were here and you said, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we, we go out and we spend the money on
expensive bud and expensive water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we just put 99 cents.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the worst at that dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a cheeseburger fanatic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been, I told her straight up after
that, like, go get meals, go make food for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, me and my wife, I've cooked
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I didn't go that far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give her ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in the kitchen and cook bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I cooked lunch with a little lady
today and it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cook for her sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually she can't make bacon the best,
but you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then get in there and you make the bacon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Making bacon, making the bacon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit, a little bit,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was following it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm, I agree with you,
but I mean, we don't have to get back on
[SPEAKER_03]: track at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk more about bacon.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen a good cartoons lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone just leads back in their chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rick and Morty is great, but I'm not aware
of Rick and Morty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that show is so bizarre.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, if you want to say, try to get
drinking and driving is cool off to
[SPEAKER_05]: children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you've told me about this one where
the guy's drinking constantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's flying a spaceship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, you know, let's clarify that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, okay, you know,
but he's slammed by the end of every show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, isn't everything just better?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hitting flower hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our plants are in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're showing the fuzzies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've pulled our males.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've top dressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our worms are happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've switched to full bloom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're feeding, if you're feeding bottle
nutrients, go lightly on the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: there, the grow or the bloom stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're feeding teas and stuff,
what should we be mixing into our teas at
[SPEAKER_03]: this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much where I get all my
nitrogen for the bloom phase from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also most seabird guanos
typically, you know, kind of high in P.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show's way off track already today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have known that was coming from
the look on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to get dabs going for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else are you putting in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a conversation with the
gentleman about this earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Armando Vigil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to throw him on blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to actually not put him on blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dude listens to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a loyal listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a shopper at high grow Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he owes, he's, that's a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_03]: He shops at the stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend he buys the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend he grows products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend he listens to.
[SPEAKER_03]: He listens to your advice to the fucking
word, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to do exactly what he knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Success is proven and he wants to do what
we are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he is a loyal listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's become my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to come hang out with us the
next time he's around.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives a little bit away from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was messaging me the last time he was
here, but I wasn't prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working in the phone was jingling
away from my pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time we're going to hang out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Mr. V.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it's Armando V Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it sounds right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's I get lost on names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even looking at a screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm 90% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's Armando because that's just
fun to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to take a Mondo dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Armando.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make sure I'm saying your
name right, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I'd feel like a dick if I'm
all shouting out the wrong guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go look right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get this out before I dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the high P. Um, uh, bat guanos,
if you got them, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of those bad guanos really,
really suck, but, um, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't, you know, not everyone's as
conflicted as I am, I suppose,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm shouting out the right guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, yeah, switch to the,
the high P and, uh, uh, rock it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any molasses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always do molasses and almost every feed
and flower after day 21, I have molasses
[SPEAKER_03]: or something similar, humble honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the Mendocino honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are, I like the humble cause it's
got the Yucca extract in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mendocino honey is dirt cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dirty cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be Yucca extract in that one,
but not as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's taking a pretty big dab right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carb cap if you want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know why you put it on
that, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the type of shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just hard to pull it up with that
other dab or how it needed the cutting
[SPEAKER_03]: edge on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Task Rock shout out brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that completely made me forget what we
were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the listeners are taking dabs with
this fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always high in P. That's some good
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, I always go with the kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what's up with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some kelp that is one zero one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just recently bought some kelp
that is zero zero one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the exact same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, this is, this is derived
from, and it's that whatever strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: you always see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, I wonder what's up with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't pay enough attention to
the packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should start looking at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain things I never pay
attention to because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the look on my face doesn't convey on a
podcast, but I've got a very curious look
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, huh, did they make different
packaging for different runs or because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stuff like that was different
companies too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I mean, where did the nitrogen
come from all of a sudden?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or, yeah, it's supposed to be
the same product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just different testing calibrations
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's supposed to be standardized
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but a lot of shit is, a lot of shit
is supposed to be standardized.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be supposed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm going to take this bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to give it to Adam,
but I realized how big it is and he
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't want to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't, he doesn't do that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should ask a question before I take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I asked about teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked about feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's time to finally train those
things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if we want to do any LST training or
anything like that, we better do it before
[SPEAKER_03]: they start budding out like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them some sticks to support
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, support themselves support.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm excited about this dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us about what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will talk about after that,
we'll talk about problems to look for and
[SPEAKER_03]: the biggest fear of all gardeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about those two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take a dab and Jesse will
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I feel like I'm on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you got the mic right by your
face, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear you so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we're, fuck I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're, we're, we're training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got the bamboos, um,
I kind of like to stick them in the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: at an angle, um, attach the plant at a,
at a lower angle on the bamboo so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still going past it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you angling in toward the pot or out
from the center of the pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Out from, out from the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I see both methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you actually want the, the bud
dangling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above the bamboo and that kind of gives it
a chance to develop its, uh, its girth and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's going to kind of fall towards
the bamboo and, and you wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of predict where it's going to fall.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also, I mean, just straight up
bamboos, um, with outdoors, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: tell your plants and at least two places,
um, the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start pinning plants with bamboos
and stakes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, you know, if this, you put them,
you know, this applies indoors too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, make sure you get them tied up
and good in two places real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that anything doesn't break over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was such a stone ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said exactly what needed to be said
while Adam and I both got to take a dab
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of get our shit back together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave us big dads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, see now I'm kind of new to the bamboo
seeking just because I never had plants
[SPEAKER_05]: big enough to even need them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I kind of asked him, he told me the
same thing the other day and I asked him,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what's really the purpose of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, you know, just to hold it
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have a tomato cage and I went out
and I purchased the only sticks that were
[SPEAKER_05]: because, you know, living here in
Colorado, things are not quite as
[SPEAKER_05]: available as you think they would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I had to, you know, I got little
ones with the little rings in them that I
[SPEAKER_05]: can just hold up my side because those are
the only ones right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I figure I can just tie it with a
loose string.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I got some branches coming in,
you know, just holding it up against the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the, the tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, yeah, that's sounds like it's,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if nothing else, you could,
you know, at maybe an earlier stage,
[SPEAKER_05]: run them through the tomato cage or,
yeah, that's, yeah, the way you did it is
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the only thing that Adam did wrong is
he tried to put the tomato cages on a
[SPEAKER_03]: little late.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had to struggle with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time I'll show you a really smooth
trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it just takes like a, I use a twisty
tie or a fucking like a pipe cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're called fuzzy sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just grab the plant from the bottom and go
up and then just tie that shit in a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get a slightly cage on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, for the size cages I got, I think it
was still a little too late for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I, I tried that trick when I went
out and bought the last one and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: just like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just stuck it down in the middle and
it kind of branched it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also cut them open and then just
wire them back together.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Jesse's a thinker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's a thinker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but next year I plan to, to have,
uh, the small square, um, fence lines
[SPEAKER_05]: around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that I've been seeing a
lot lately on YouTube and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, um, I actually tomorrow have to try to
put one on one of those monsters.
[SPEAKER_03]: The outside one actually sell a 16 inch
tomato cage that comes apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, uh, the sticks are three different
pieces and the cage is two different loops
[SPEAKER_03]: that come apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can put that on after and really
endorse those tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are fucking useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're a good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually might've learned about them
through sub cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, mine were 99 cents.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't really complain when it's user
error trying to get it onto something.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Adam's words of the wisdom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys were talking about moths and
worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are referred to in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: As corn bird orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a little side conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're actually in Europe called a
hemp or, um, when prohibition hit the,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't any more hemp plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went for corn and, uh,
um, you know, we're looking up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on them here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm Googling it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I know what a hillbilly knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what a, uh, what he's about
to read for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: The European corn borer.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, I'm just reading it straight
from Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_03]: The European cornworm or European corn
borer, also known as the European high
[SPEAKER_03]: flyer is a pest of grain, particularly
maize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the insect is native to Europe,
originally infesting varieties of millet,
[SPEAKER_03]: including broom corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an ugly fucking bug, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, uh, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it says the European corn borer
caterpillars damage the ears of corn as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as stocks by chewing tunnels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, in which to, which caused the plant to
fall over, uh, biological control agents
[SPEAKER_03]: of corn borers include, uh, sorry,
I'm just going to read that part,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they dig a tunnel in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say it and read it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they lay little eggs in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it shows these fucking disgusting
orange worms that grow out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is when I got all freaked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what is this dark spot on my plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is the kind of stuff that I
knew that stuff will burrow and lay eggs
[SPEAKER_05]: inside of, and then rot from the inside
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen them like in the stock or
mine were like right at the base.
[SPEAKER_03]: They lay clusters of eggs on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually the undersides, the egg masses or
clusters relate an overlap in an
[SPEAKER_03]: overlapping configuration.
[SPEAKER_03]: The larva develop inside of the eggs and
the eggs become more, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these things are ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eventually turn into a flying insect,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they fly, they land on the plant,
they burrow in, or they lay eggs on the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they turn into these worms that chew
on your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, so the original flying thing,
eat your plant, the new worm they left,
[SPEAKER_03]: eat your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it turns into a flying thing that
eats your plant and comes back and drops
[SPEAKER_03]: more of these fucking demon bugs on your
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good ways to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention is the best way I've came up
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent hours picking them out by hand
because they, they destroy, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunately it's not going to destroy an
entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They destroy a piece of a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're trimming at the end of the
year, it is very easy to locate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spotted those orange worms in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually knew a guy that would dry and
smoke those orange worms himself through
[SPEAKER_03]: that crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, those are mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He loved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you talk shit about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monterey spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, has some effect on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, our good old friend neem oil,
but it really sucks cause you're spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: neem oil on a flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask, is that product okay
with flowers?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, not neem oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what neem oil does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't put neem oil in your flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Monterey.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's an organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a, use it as more of a
deterrent maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that's what I sprayed my plants
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all through veg, uh, religiously,
uh, every four days they got sprayed with
[SPEAKER_00]: something different, mixed it up,
kept it all organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to scare those plants away or
those bugs away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goddamn truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so we've gotten, uh, man, fuck the
moths.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they're big too, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like the size of a big lighter,
except triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your praying mantis isn't going to do
shit against those.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen one ripping out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure that probably fills up a
praying man is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're just fluff anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they get all that moth dust in
your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so, uh, yeah, those things are huge
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's a cool story that you fucking
said that they used to be hemp moths
[SPEAKER_03]: before they were corn because the Wiki
didn't say anything about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a cool story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably links me to those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we'll do it just for fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise known as the corn moth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you mean this?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, uh, an old timer told me
that there's not a Wiki for it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's all, it's all weed stuff
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all like nasty bugs, nasty bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was a freaky sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever's phone did that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, is that not anybody's phone?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was my phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why it's going off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was like the aliens were coming
to the head like forever ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I feel like an idiot because it
was still talking to you, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still talking to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to call you out about
leaving your phone on, on table during a
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely unprofessional about now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we have talked about moths and worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see, other than the obvious problem
that you know, I'm going to bring up,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you, uh, what are any other problems we
can look for right now, uh, that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: work with right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of try to prevent,
um, you know, I mean, it's still pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: early in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, uh, spider mites are
going to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fucking say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't hear them either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if you don't have a lot of
air circulation and it gets moist and I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, it creates the conditions for
powdery mold, um, plan for the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get the, um, damn, I can't remember any
brand names tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Actinovate, Vesta for Ox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that for powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actinovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse shouts that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm testing a product called, which is
brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, as soon as I find a situation to
use it in, not to be a tick, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, but yeah, it's called witches brew and
supposedly it just like totally
[SPEAKER_00]: annihilates powdery mildew, but,
um, and it's totally organic and made in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, up in Denver somewhere, uh,
or maybe Boulder, you know, up North
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, and it's cheap too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of you guys are sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like you might need a hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you guys are not in places where
you're able to walk into a hydro shop and
[SPEAKER_03]: be like, yo, I need freaking the whole big
bottle of spin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, sorry, hit the volume button on
the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking with something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you can't be like, I need a big bottle
of Monterey spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was actually at, go ahead,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say what you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I'm just looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you're going to say something
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a Monterey at a Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where exactly Rose headed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are in Tennessee, Georgia,
Florida that might, I don't condone your
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't support that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fucking do that illegal against the
law.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a grown man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you happen to be doing that,
cause I can't condone it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't support it for the right to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but I'll go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I say, Hey, you in Kentucky grow
fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you insist on doing it,
you can get your products at like Lowe's
[SPEAKER_03]: and Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're really careful about what you
do, look for that Omri certified shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there are a few products that Monterey
spray that we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just says Monterey insect spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says contain spin a sad right on the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, spin a sad kills a lot of,
uh, insects that you'll find in the
[SPEAKER_03]: garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neem oil is also out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neem oil is there for veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you should use Neem oil and veg often.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can dilute it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and you're really not going to hurt
anything unless you use it in flour and
[SPEAKER_03]: spray the ground around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I saw a product, I can't remember the
name, but it contains white oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little tiny bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nine bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's got some white oil in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not used it yet, but I'm sure that
that would knock out your flying insects
[SPEAKER_03]: and mites really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to research the name,
but look for it guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need some stuff, you can actually
get your products at a home Depot or
[SPEAKER_03]: Lowe's or something similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, don't be discreet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't talk about your weed when you're at
any store, even the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only place you can talk about your
grow is in your grow or at your table with
[SPEAKER_03]: your crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're talking about problems and a
garden right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to, we're talking about bugs
and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more thing is fucking homies and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful who you tell everybody's your
friend today, but in like a week when you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys have the stupidest fight over the
dumbest song on the radio that reminded
[SPEAKER_03]: you with that girl, Oh, you were with her
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're not friends anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a grow officer or we're going to
steal his grow or just shut up about your
[SPEAKER_03]: girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows everybody in Colorado
grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much of it here that it's not
as threatening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's growing their own crops here,
but you guys that are in those other
[SPEAKER_03]: places, just be careful with your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been, Oh, go ahead,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might've grown a plant or two before
medical and, uh, uh, there was no such
[SPEAKER_00]: thing as talking to anyone about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to the hydro shop before
everybody had a medical card, it was dead
[SPEAKER_03]: silence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could hear the cashier going as she
rung up your shit in the hydro store and
[SPEAKER_03]: she'd mumbled numbers because she didn't
want Jesse to hear how much I just fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: spent at the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even write it on paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the classic, no, I'm not even going to
say when you run into friends at the hydro
[SPEAKER_03]: shop, if you and I used to run into each
other, Hey bro, can I get a cut of that
[SPEAKER_03]: white widow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll trade you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we shop owner will tell you to shut up
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That never happened to me at least back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just, yeah, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse's got a horror story.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to share with me after the
podcast coming from out East, anything
[SPEAKER_05]: that I ever had outside and was like,
yo, check this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell you right now for no,
what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always your friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's, I'm here to tell you right
now, nine times out of 10, if something's
[SPEAKER_05]: stolen from me, it's somebody,
you know, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's somebody you bragged about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just, you know, keep it quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't bring girls to your spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't, they don't know what to look
at anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, but well then they just talk
randomly and if they don't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: business being there, don't bring girls.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just trying to be cool,
don't bring girls to your grow to be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen women bring down girl rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until the pot's harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we, I love you ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the loyal ladies that are loyal to
their man, but some of you girls don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know when to stop talking about the grow
room that you saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may or may not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that guy's fault for taking you to
the grow room without knowing you well
[SPEAKER_03]: enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may or may not have had a plant snapped
in half a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this leads us to something that we all
dread other than the police and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't worry a lot about the police
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all obey the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We either have a medical marijuana card or
we are an adult in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any adult over 21 can grow six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're allowed to grow six plants
at any house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that if Jesse and I lived in
the same house, I don't know if we could
[SPEAKER_03]: grow 12 outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that works, but as a
medical marijuana provider, a lot of us
[SPEAKER_03]: have increased counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like you might have something to
add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to be accused of giving
anyone legal advice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in that spectrum of where I'm allowed
to have six plants, but I'm allowed to
[SPEAKER_05]: have three flowering and three not
flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the law in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have six plants, three in flower,
three not in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the freaking logistics or
whatever the bottom end of the fine print.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if Adam and I and Jesse live
together, can we do 18 plants in the
[SPEAKER_03]: backyard?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to kind of be up on that and
they kind of seem to cock block a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: those moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're smart in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're catching on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we digress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse's walking so he's tip toeing in his
Jordans through the kitchen trying to get
[SPEAKER_03]: a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually heard a rumor that Pueblo
County is going to instate a 18 plant
[SPEAKER_00]: limit per household total.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like shit that Pueblo does.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so we're allowed to have six
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: God you just fucking change my whole
thought process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to go political.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got a set in with the town hall
meeting the other day with Sal Pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty much he was campaigning for
himself, but someone brought up marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was real quick to bring up the fact
that they're planning on instating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already called him twice and I
left a message at the end of the town hall
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a lot of you guys that grow those
little tiny hydro plants are like six
[SPEAKER_03]: inches tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't be able to get shit off of 18
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I won't clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was he just talking recreational and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're caregivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got patients that rely on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring that up on further episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will get into this and figure out
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far it's just at the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about bringing the wrong
people to your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about trying to impress
chicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the biggest fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thieves, you guys, people are going to
steal your outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow for three years in a row,
one of those years, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be fucking stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the that's the old school rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years later, a year later.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yeah, because next year they're going
to know that crop is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll go and look and they'll be like,
oh, it's not here to give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thieves are going to come to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to talk too much about
this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that needs to be
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently in our community, a 13-year-old
boy was shot in the back because he was
[SPEAKER_03]: attempting to steal somebody's outdoor
marijuana grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dude was arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to go to court.
[SPEAKER_03]: He shot that person in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to point out this was a pellet
gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, it was a pellet gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a high caliber pellet gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pellet was not an actual firearm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the pellet is lodged in this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to be taken to Denver Children's
Hospital to be rescued.
[SPEAKER_03]: He almost died.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in critical condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on either one of these guys'
sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on the shooter's side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on the kid's side.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kid was a thief.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in the yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: The newspaper said he was out of the yard,
and he shot him in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're just going to act like that he
was right next to the pot plants in this
[SPEAKER_03]: story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking 3 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was part of a gang as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to point out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if there's multiple, then you got
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's the one that got it, then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put everybody that's listening to
this that has an outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to put this story in their heads
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got your pot plants outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like seven days before you cut them
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a hard on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just fucking drooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're rubbing your hands together like a
porno is about to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucking drooling like food is
cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're about to go on the ride of your
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your outdoor crop about to come
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 3 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get woken up to the dogs going nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get woken up to the fucking lights
coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look on your security cameras that
hopefully you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk a couple in a couple
of seconds about things to do to prevent
[SPEAKER_03]: some thieves, but I want to set this story
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those alarms are going off the assholes up
on your security camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see him cutting down your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's about to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking 19 year old kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's wearing a black hoodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell who he is cutting your shit
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's about to run out of your yard here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a 90% chance there's a gun in your
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably you got a baseball bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a camper, you got a machete.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about what you're going to do
because it could happen to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could walk out there and put yourself
in a more dangerous situation than what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're ready for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could walk out there and be like this
guy in our town that shot somebody and has
[SPEAKER_03]: to deal with a kid that could die right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that that kid's life was
worth anything in my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want something, I'll let you have
it and I won't kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like something fucking stupid
to say, but if you need it that bad,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not worth killing you for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll grow more next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave my mother plants and my seeds where
they are and we'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you have it like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas somebody like me who is depending
on those three plants, not only for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: but for my old lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be rough for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be spending money every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm trying to put that story in
these growers' heads now, these new folks'
[SPEAKER_03]: heads that haven't had to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me break it down from the suspect's
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got woken up at 2 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.30 in the morning, he grabbed a BB gun
and he shot someone in his yard protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: his plants in an effort to protect his
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the cop showed up because he shot
someone and the cop saw his plants and he
[SPEAKER_00]: shot someone and the cops realized that he
valued his plants more than he valued
[SPEAKER_00]: human life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now he's sitting in a jail cell because
these people otherwise didn't protect his
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm highly conflicted on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I tried to not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I'm not taking a side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there, but I want our listeners
to kind of... Even if he gets away with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, his face has been on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: His plants are still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in town knows they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops won't touch him because they're
not going to maintain that evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to have to spend lawyer
fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably lost his job.
[SPEAKER_00]: His dad's been on the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if he gets away with it all,
he still lost his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little boy has... Just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even thinking that, oh, I'll just get him
with the pellet gun.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just coming out the door with the
pellet gun, they were running.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get yourself shot doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What if he's got a real gun?
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can walk out and put yourself in worse
danger than what you were prepared for to
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with for those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you love your dogs, don't turn them
out either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the dog goes in... They're going to run
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them go nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, flicker them, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get a good look at the
situation, try to scare them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got an elevated... Maybe you can
walk out on a back balcony or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just scaring them off, throwing a rock at
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see... Throw a rock, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the fuck out of my yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone's in your yard, throw a fucking
rock at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know your dog's got the
situation... You can still literally hit
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody in the head with a damn
hand-sized rock and probably do some real
[SPEAKER_05]: good size damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my point is think about,
be prepared what you're going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't want you to have to... The
only way to be prepared for that situation
[SPEAKER_03]: is to think about it today while I'm
telling you about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when someone's in your yard
stealing your shit, you don't panic and
[SPEAKER_03]: shit your pants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, if you prepare for it and think
about it, you've got a plan of action.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how to get out there quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how to get rid of a thief.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want anybody to try to be a hero
for a pot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear about anybody else
shooting more people for weed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need that kind of publicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going great right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gangster to go to jail for
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a weed grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put that on the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we don't need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, we shouldn't be growing
enough to make it worth robbing us,
[SPEAKER_04]: which it sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we're not defending thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're saying take the high road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are the lowest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work so hard for what we have and in
one night and a couple of hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: they take it all away from you and they
leave it scattered down in your alley,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you have to clean it up at eight o
'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your neighbors finally realize it's
not worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had one plant taken from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown one plant outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess how many I got taken from me?
[SPEAKER_03]: One fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived in a snazzy neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant was in a nice backyard tucked
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the gardeners are the ones that
fucking took that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never grown in my own yard before
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the year I tried it, I got taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we scared the shit out of
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be prepared, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not I don't know what you're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to shoot people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to fight people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to protect your crop
peacefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use your voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scare the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look outside and it's your
cousin Earl beat his fucking ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to I was going to make
the example if you're stealing Adam's
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and he catches you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam's fucked if he walks out and tries to
stop you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If Adam's stealing your plants and you
catch him, Adam is fucked if you try to
[SPEAKER_03]: catch him.
[SPEAKER_03]: The array of outcomes could be very broad
if there's a thief in your yard.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, me knowing that I'm going
to steal his plants, I'm probably not
[SPEAKER_05]: coming with just my skinny arms either.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're going to his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, he's got more than his big
ass arms in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where this all just keeps
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It escalates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jail is the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should put some outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outside next month or next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try again next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl with doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't shoot thieves.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jail sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk about if we don't want to
lose our plants and shoot people,
[SPEAKER_03]: how can we prevent this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big dogs in your backyard, keeping them
through at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you're going to use them as
security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't leave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't you know, these are
working dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to stay outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a good dog house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a summer in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be outside protecting your
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I like a mixture of big dogs
and little dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those little yapper dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wake up the big ones and then,
and then it's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking big pit bulls will come do
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't sleep during the night,
during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just gotten, I don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows that those crops are important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also if your dog bites somebody,
you're going to have to fucking deal with
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to take your dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to put your dog in
quarantine, make it doesn't have,
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure it doesn't have rabies.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your dog really eats the shit out of
somebody, hopefully it doesn't come to
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to use two dogs as examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I got into a yard and Soraka Nana
rushed me and barked at me, I would be
[SPEAKER_03]: gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a very good runner, but I would
run a record lap with those two dogs
[SPEAKER_03]: behind me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, lights and cameras are your best
friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights and cameras are anybody's best
friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in a sketchy hood,
put some lights and cameras up on your
[SPEAKER_03]: house, uh, flood lights and cameras.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once people see those cameras,
they know, and they're like, I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: motion sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mount them high enough so that,
um, an animal isn't going to set them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I live in the city, but there's a
couple little tricks you can do with that
[SPEAKER_03]: animal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have to set off a motion detector
over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to fucking shoot it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got deer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right across the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about, you know,
those deer may come have a snack on your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to keep an eye out for
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm putting the dog out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what's good?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they want my weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be eating good that week.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one plant that smells like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other three or the other two are just
like, eh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, it's early still.
[SPEAKER_03]: They shouldn't have much of a lot of aroma
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you guys ever hung bells on your
plants, just like the Christmas
[SPEAKER_03]: decorations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thieves are cowards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much to scare them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, I mean, put yourselves in
their shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in someone's backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not know in the middle of the
night it is, and they're doing something,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, they're breaking two or
three rules and, and laws and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not going to take much to spook
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's likely somebody you know,
so they don't want you to see their face
[SPEAKER_03]: or their clothes or their body language.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell anybody about those either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, tuck them up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another, um, when mine got taken,
uh, they were heavily, heavily bambooed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had, uh, you know, kind of made a
big old fricking bush out of one little
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the bamboos actually played,
uh, it was hard for them to pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I still had, you know,
a couple of branches left to each one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, you know, so those bamboos serve
a couple of purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse brought up, Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be leading to what I was going
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they ever tripped and fell on some,
you know, we're good for the VC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a great point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse brought up earlier, guys,
be friends with your neighbors,
[SPEAKER_03]: be a friendly, polite, courteous neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your yard clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your backyard clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your music down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your grow discreet and make friends
with your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think they're legit,
you can almost let them know you're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing and not have to hide that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe share with them, smoke out your
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'll know that that day crop
in the backyard, they got to keep an eye
[SPEAKER_03]: on it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe they won't steal it from
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause some, some neighbors will check your
shit, but then maybe if someone does come
[SPEAKER_03]: in the yard, they'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they'll keep an eye on that shit
because they know that, uh, they've been
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you'll throw them an ounce or two
when it gets done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll come over and help you trim,
you know, our neighbors on the farmer like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's far neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys aren't living in the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole new ball game now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made a little spike shape on my paper
here to remind me to talk about something.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you guys are going to set some
kind of weird booby traps or some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: things for the thieves to get hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't condone that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's just like shooting somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like letting your dogs out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get some trouble for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get manslaughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think it's also ten places called
man trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, don't, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really, really pisses cops off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they think, Oh, I could have stepped
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's especially if you're in an illegal
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: What if they, what if they arrest you at
the front door, you know, and they lead
[SPEAKER_05]: you to the car and they just go walking
around back and it's dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just step on whatever you put in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you just assaulted a police officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not, not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're handcuffed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's if, if you're doing things like
this, that's you've probably got a
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial crop and, uh, you're probably
doing a lot of things wrong and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really doing anyone but yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's those, uh, somebody showed me a
Google map.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might've talked about this, a Google map
where there's a community in NorCal where
[SPEAKER_03]: you can tell the same dude set up like
seven lots of housing or it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse owns one lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam owns another.
[SPEAKER_03]: I own another, but since we're all allowed
to have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just subdivided all this land and set
up gigantic crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like you built all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like one guy set up all these
crops for all these families.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those guys have a lot on the line,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if somebody goes in there and tries
to take 10 of those plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a lot to fucking lose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are five, 10 pound plants each.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would, I would hope at that point of
scale, you know, you can pay two dudes to
[SPEAKER_05]: sit around with flashlights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Hey, I mean, I don't even want to
set up the scene for a shitty movie,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's a lot of money on that
mountain, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a short window when it's done and
not harvested, but could be cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the growers are trying to let it get
that final few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, just a few, the three of us
could, and it always seems to goes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine the amount of work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all of it, the house dressed out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm horrible about cutting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine just like all the
tension in your head?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You show up that morning like,
Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that half an acre of plants just
missing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so another thing that can help you
from getting ripped off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote this real big.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be discreet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always quit showing everybody,
quit talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's so much fun to post Instagram
pictures and shit though, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a way to take pride in your
work though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like save all those pictures
until the stuff is done, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then maybe say, look what,
you know, this is the buildup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to post to Instagram under
your real fucking name either.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to call out a couple of
people that do it, but I know where you
[SPEAKER_03]: live and I know where your backyard's
located.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see those gigantic plants on your
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all of your friends on your friends
list are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think I have mine on a select few.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's taunting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show geographical landmarks in your
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell her your house stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mountain in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got anything to add?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're going to finish this part up if
these guys don't have anything to add.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Adam and I are going to come
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're recording on a fucking Thursday
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Saturday, Adam and another friend and I
are going to go see Joe Rogan at the
[SPEAKER_03]: comedy works in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're going to do that,
but that is what Adam just said with the
[SPEAKER_03]: funny look on his face.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely going to be, uh,
Joe Rogan is recording his next comedy
[SPEAKER_03]: central special.
[SPEAKER_03]: At comedy works Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was lucky enough to score some
tickets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, and thank you by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can't thank you enough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, uh, um, I want to see some iry
genetic shirts in the crowd when I watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was trying to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what I got told?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said they're 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking for that 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as I find that, then we'll get to
our genetic shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, if you guys, so Adam and I will
be back in a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a couple of dabs and
wrap up this portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys got anything fun to say for
the end of this part, go ahead and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, shout it out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to shout out anybody cool,
if you want to get, uh, I did not get to
[SPEAKER_05]: shout out to people that listen,
uh, back East, uh, my homie Stumps and QP
[SPEAKER_05]: James.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they both listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who's Dickfoot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that one of your friends?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I don't know a Dickfoot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Dickfoot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you were, that's a hellacious
Twitter handle right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, of course that, uh,
Pothick Anna that you, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you recommended said my mom said she's
really helping her out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any shout outs over there, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I know you're not that shout out guy,
but shout out to organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not include Ross Cola and queen
Cola in our shout outs on a blast episode
[SPEAKER_03]: on 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm saying, we're going to,
we're going to be doing a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that guy to come explain some shit
to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross Cola.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen to the show, bro,
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, I know there's a way you can get
in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works for the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would probably make that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever time he could, he could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm available 36 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sean, if you're listening, bro,
come on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to hear you talk about organic
as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's how you roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I could learn from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The listeners could definitely learn from
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd appreciate John.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the listeners, you guys hear me
inviting somebody really cool on,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we get them on, you'll be proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he, he really knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually ran a pretty cool little
urban farm kind of deal before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's he's a, yeah, he's super strict
on our real cool story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to have him on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can bring a, you can bring the lady if
you want, if that's still happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen you in a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hope I'm not touching on a sore subject
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to her either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was always fun to dab with.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys, it looks like it's time to
wrap up the dab portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give one quick shout out to
dreadful Jay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up mama?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for all your support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow those seeds with all your love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we're going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in just a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to the music, shake your booty,
get down.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys, thanks for joining us for
another grow episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give Jesse a huge thanks for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys learned a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Adam, did you learn anything,
bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: I sure did, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like you're dabbed out over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of fucking high, we had a super
great time last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam, myself and a little friend of ours
got to go see Joe Rogan record his next
[SPEAKER_03]: standup comedy special for Comedy Central
at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you think of that show,
bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen a professional comic,
so to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides when we went up to Denver,
but it was great, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I woke up in my cheeks and my ribs were
still sore from laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: My cheeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Hinchcliffe opened up for Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: At ComedyWorks last night, he did 15 solid
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every second of his set was ripping.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a funny dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of him before,
but he was definitely an interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a little dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a little twisted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's your grin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, yeah, that's right up our
alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, Joe Rogan is a
legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crushed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came out a little bit nervous,
I felt like, but he used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He harnessed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grabbed that energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then somebody tried to heckle Joe
Rogan about 10 minutes into his set.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when he calmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He totally broke free of the bubble of,
I'm recording a show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he kind of chewed that lady a tiny bit
of a chewing of a new asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just made her feel really stupid for a
second, like a comedian should do,
[SPEAKER_03]: and went back about his business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a hell of a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a great comedy special.
[SPEAKER_05]: ComedyWorks is a great setting,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ate dinner at a place called the
Something Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember the name, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that place was dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: That pizza was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our server was pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the best pizzas I've ever
had, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not really a big pizza fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ate all the way to the end of the
crust and everything, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We killed that large pizza between the
three of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should have been enough pizza for four
people, but three high people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had nothing to do with the dabs before the
show, the pregame.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, a guy named Phil
approached me after the comedy show,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he asked me if I was the guy that owns
the Seed Company, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks,
and I'm wearing an Irie Genetics t-shirt
[SPEAKER_03]: in the middle of downtown Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, do you own that seed company?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that's me, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Phil, if you're listening to the
podcast, if you found the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: congratulations and thanks for your
support, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really cool meeting somebody that
just knew me from my seed company and my
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram and Facebook presence.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Phil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, do you have anybody you need to give
a shout out to in this episode?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys I hit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we kind of rambled on the Joe
Rogan part for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friend Angela.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to join us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good time with Angela.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming to pizza and being a
really cool passenger.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys ever get to go see a show at
ComedyWorks, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug Benson will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I'm giving Doug Benson a plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug Benson will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are pot smokers and you live
in Colorado, go see Doug Benson at
[SPEAKER_03]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the date is September 15th.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can arrange a little smoke
session.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me know if you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet me about it at I Grow Culture on
Twitter or email me I Grow Culture at
[SPEAKER_03]: Hotmail dot com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, of course, find me on Facebook under I
Grow Culture and we will we can smoke out
[SPEAKER_03]: at the Doug Benson show after the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't smoke in ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will kick you the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a note here that says watch your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try not to watch or I'm trying not to cuss
so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's one of my downfalls of being
a great podcaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll quit saying the F word a lot because
it's really not good class.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not good taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to try to quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I on the other hand, you can talk like a
fucking pirate if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not the host of a show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all of our pirate friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Search for I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening to us on Stitcher,
please leave a comment there and give us a
[SPEAKER_03]: good review.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those reviews help the show move up in
the rankings, which in turn gets us more
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to spread my message to everyone
who needs help or wants grow information.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about a thousand listeners on the
past couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: A thousand people are hearing us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think eleven hundred listeners on
episode twenty four.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I looked, the stats are a few
days behind because it takes a minute for
[SPEAKER_03]: the analytics to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were eleven hundred listeners on
episode twenty four.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the night where we were
recording twenty six.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes them two weeks and we get
eleven hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the first week, we usually get about
eight hundred listens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first week an episode is posted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to give.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of people hearing our
message.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to give a huge thank you to all
eleven hundred of you that are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want you guys to do me one favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eleven hundred of you are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody tell two of your friends about
the I Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say, man, I was you know,
everybody grows, smokes, loves weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: has something to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You all know two stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if it's your mom and she's afraid of
weed, she can listen to us be semi
[SPEAKER_03]: educated and we're good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We preach a good message on the last part
with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We said, don't shoot people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can you can break myths.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can educate people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can if somebody's lonely and wants
something to listen to, we've got great
[SPEAKER_03]: radio voices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just absolutely educate people anytime
you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you can spread the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all eleven hundred of you, a thousand
of you, fifteen hundred by the time this
[SPEAKER_03]: episode posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of you guys tell two people and now if
one of them listens to the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: then we got three thousand listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when iTunes and Stitcher really
start paying attention once you break that
[SPEAKER_03]: twenty five hundred marker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's all the ratings is
really doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it tells people that the show is
good, but more than anything else,
[SPEAKER_05]: it helps your relationship with iTunes or
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it moves us up in the ranking,
it shows people that we exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like it's just our brand has
more integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: If more people are listening, people say,
oh, people are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be worth listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, you know, when you're
seeing a killer band, nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: dance until that first idiot dances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just dance, guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything that I've learned from
Colorado, just get out there and dance
[SPEAKER_03]: because there are people far behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants to be the first dancer,
but those fifth and tenth dancers,
[SPEAKER_03]: those guys are all going to love you for
breaking the ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to, you know, let's just get
the show moved up there and that way more
[SPEAKER_03]: people love more people can learn how to
grow high grade cannabis, less people will
[SPEAKER_03]: be afraid of cannabis and more people will
be properly educated about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: the things that go with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to you preach a good message,
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to big up the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel like I'm an ambassador to the
plant now, to the whole industry and to
[SPEAKER_03]: the movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm I'm the voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a few of us that have
podcasts and we're starting to be
[SPEAKER_03]: recognized and I want to be you're helping
very positive for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be a bad vibe for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want people to think I'm a stupid
pothead.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do because I take fucking Graham
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have dreadlocks, but that's just
that you prove them wrong every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really appreciated because I thank
you guys all for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ranting and rambling again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't forget the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, Swell.
[SPEAKER_03]: AM.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also every episode all the way from
episode one is on I Regenetics Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: dot com.

that I just met in person today,

[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dustin was saying he listens to episode.

[SPEAKER_03]: beginning and he will catch up while he
