[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to talk about being in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been watching the show I'm sure
you've heard me talk about the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: project I've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some breeding in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the greenhouse earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fingers are still sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arm hair is still sticky but I am super
excited because the seeds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in that greenhouse are almost
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting super hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a nice dark color to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting some tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look really really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty soon we will have some outdoor
bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this before on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of talking about it again
because I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give you guys updates on what's
going on with my projects bring you in
[SPEAKER_00]: make you feel included.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants happened much more quickly
than I expected it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were ready for pollen earlier than I
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen dumped earlier than
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds hardened up much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned a lot this year with our
inaugural outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been asking a lot of questions
since I've been hinting about what I put
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a couple of a couple of
ideas of what went out there this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did put in a rise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The King Solomon male was in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that got pollinated was
pollinated by King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first male that I should talk about
that we put out there was the Platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I put Platinum Tangi out there
because that makes Sun Kiss seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very familiar with the Platinum Tangi
plant and I'm very familiar with the Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be able to tell what that Platinum
Tangi plant is doing outdoors compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once the seeds are made I've got
plenty of that makes Sun Kiss is what that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got plenty of Sun Kiss seeds that
were made indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got Sun Kiss made outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next move is to grow both of those
in similar conditions and see if the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor produced seeds show any difference
than the indoor produced seeds of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the same exact genetics but one was
made indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was made in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally honestly realistically do not
know if we will see any difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were different things in the
environment which may fall in line in
[SPEAKER_00]: epigenetics or I don't know how it may
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be differences is what I'm
saying and I want to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started off with that Platinum Tangi
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a blueberry cookies plant
outdoors so that we can make more blue
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are asking for blue
raspberry truffle seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making some outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a Mandarin Sunset plant outside
so we can make more of the Lady Marmalade.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some new things some things that
I'm making brand new crosses of and there
[SPEAKER_00]: are others out there that we don't need to
talk about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like leaving a little bit of
suspense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to build that suspense a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about what's out there in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to kind of tease you a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting the seeds are getting
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are getting fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so sticky and so stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out there at the greenhouse and then
I had to run a couple of errands and
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere I went after that they gave me
dirty looks because I was stinking so
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful aroma but it went so
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next year we're going to do things a
little bit but a lot a bit differently and
[SPEAKER_00]: we should produce two or three times as
many seeds next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get excited with me because pretty soon I
will be sending these seeds out for
[SPEAKER_00]: testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right now I do want to take a moment
to give my buddy Mike a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a follower of the podcast you
know that oftentimes I do have my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does the we say that I do the grow part
of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all the everything that involves
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that involves paperwork
contacting the lawyer all of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that is sort of Mike's department.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say that Mike handles the front of
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I handle the back of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is kind of my tag team partner when
it comes to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Mike for his all of his
hard work dedication to our industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm heading at you guys is Mike has a
Patreon page where he has recently posted
[SPEAKER_00]: a great Patreon post.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go read his post if you are
interested in becoming a cannabis activist
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis advocate if you want to be
involved if you want to go to city council
[SPEAKER_00]: and speak if you want some ammo if you
want some education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is a great source of that information
a great source for that education.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recently posted a couple of things on
his Patreon that I think would be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for you to read if you want to
be active in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to my buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check him out at patreon.com forward
slash white Mike and really briefly I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just explain why we call him white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is my buddy that I'm a white guy with
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that's a cliche thing but I'm
the white guy with dreadlocks smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: fat joint with the music too loud in the
car driving too fast and Mike will
[SPEAKER_00]: politely remind me he'll say hey buddy
you're the white guy with dreadlocks with
[SPEAKER_00]: the music too loud smoking a joint driving
too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one or two of those and only do one
or two of those at a time or you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to jail today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like yeah you're kind of right
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of a joke that I call him
white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just just make sure to follow the
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's super uptight white guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need that on my team because I'm the
fucking opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create a good balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you got the name white Mike
just a white dude super he listens to 311
[SPEAKER_00]: and wears Genco's.
[SPEAKER_00]: What more white dude could you ask for
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but love for that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics in the podcast would not
be here without Mike's encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support advice and activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go support white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough rambling and kissing Mike's
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some Patreon questions here laid
out in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to everybody that supports the show
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do we read first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to grab this one right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to the left of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from do they want their name
said they sign their name J6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to J6 at J6 organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you were keeping well and feeling
iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother I'm feeling great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're feeling iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope things are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope the plants look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope the garden is going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says here I enjoyed listening to your
grow from your heart podcast shows and
[SPEAKER_00]: recently I stumbled upon episode 602 where
you speak in detail about the silver
[SPEAKER_00]: thiosulfate recipe and the method used in
creating your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes thank you for listening bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that that's working well for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're on the path to making some
silver thiosulfate and some femme seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and thank you for listening by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say here is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon mixing the two part solution together
this solution is further diluted to a one
[SPEAKER_00]: to nine ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you're on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made one liter and we use up to 100
milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah if you got a one to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't mention anything about storing
the other 900 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good good point to bring up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can this solution be stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: If so what's the best practice for storage
and what is the shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes you can store that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best practice would be to keep it
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colder the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colder you can keep that solution the
better it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally and I probably should have
mentioned this before we got to this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally it would store better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start from the very very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a good better best sort
of situation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They store better as powders non diluted
into anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powder by itself in the refrigerator
in a cool dry dark place is the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep the powder stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next longest storage method is to
have part A and part B mixed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: water but not mixed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you mix them together they last
a little bit less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I said that in the correct
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mix them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last the longest parts A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powder into the water will last a
little less longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you cross them all together
mix them all together it lasts even less
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way possible would be keep it
powdered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then keep them divided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you mix it you can store it in a
cool dry dark place like the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a jar in the fridge now.
[SPEAKER_00]: An important important note.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put your silver
thiosulfate in the refrigerator make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: to clearly mark what that stuff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's odorless.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want anybody drinking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think it would be harmful if you
took a couple of swigs out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not give that any risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not give that an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly label that silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got children in the house people
that can't read.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to judge anybody but let's
set them up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clearly label that that is silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put a ring of tape around the rim of
the jar or the bottle so that nobody can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily pull that open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they do open it they go why the fuck
is there electrical tape or duct tape on
[SPEAKER_00]: my moonshine or my jar of water here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them think another step before they
pour that silver thiosulfate down their
[SPEAKER_00]: gullet and make themselves sick and blame
it on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set everybody in your house up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: By clearly labeling the silver thiosulfate
that is stored in your fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is in a bag and then it's labeled and
then it's clear I'm the only one here that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else is going in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody else goes in there and drink
it they're an intruder and they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: the diarrhea that it gives them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can store it in the fridge is the
best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stores well cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I've never honestly stored any
for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make the one to nine ratio and then I
use the hundred milliliters in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I make the bottle of spray and
then I spray the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I use that again in three days
and pour more of that into the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I spray I spray the shit out of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the whole liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the course of a feminized project I
don't have any left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use that entire liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually don't store it for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long it can be stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me silver thiosulfate is super
affordable super cheap to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cost that much for 20 or 30
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make gallons of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just make a fresh batch every time
I'm trying to make new feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a batch mixed up now because I'm
actually beginning to make some new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good segue right guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am starting to make more feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are asking for the orange
gas and the golden goats the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffries and a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in the works you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have started that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rush me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get it done correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But feminized seeds are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're in high demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have practically been begging for
the fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of space to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have other projects ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning to adjust and breed in a whole
room with LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me some patience and we'll get
those fem seeds coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the works you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can store the silver thiosulfate in
a cool dry dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cheap that I honestly just make
more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't store a lot of it
because I use all of what I make to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse the plants that I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just make that one liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use it for the next 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly I start reversing a plant
sometimes up to two weeks before I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two weeks before a flower it gets a
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: A week before a flower it gets a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day before a flower it gets a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every three days for 21 days it'll
get a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to spray it 10 times ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a couple of more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a longer flowering sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll spray it more times even into flower
just to remind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bitch don't go back to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep making those flowering balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep making pollen for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reminding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just giving it the spray that it needs to
keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encouraging it to keep producing pollen
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spray it enough to where I use all of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever have any leftovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just make more next time
because it's very cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it correctly it is a very
very cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most affordable
ingredients that we can buy for the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: is making our own silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered most of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best place to store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know the exact shelf life
because I've never it's never lasted me
[SPEAKER_00]: that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like asking me the shelf life of a
life of cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't it's never lasted that long dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never gotten to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could give you better info on
that but I really I would be lying and
[SPEAKER_00]: making some shit up and that's not how I
do the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Store it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everybody in the household knows
that that stuff is not to drink with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to make any food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't consume that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I think everything will go well for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just make more dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fun to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know you have a fresh potent
batch every time you work with it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it does lose quality over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it changes colors it's going bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it starts getting dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start seeing stuff floating in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lid of the jar starts turning dark
purple then it's probably time to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the question bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to some replies on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says to read the one from Cincy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to grab this one right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a person who I called
Cincy nasty in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have been asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've asked me to call them Cincy loco
or Cincy crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my buddy Cincy crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked why I called them Cincy nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sneaker head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently discovered some Nike Dunk SB
lows that said nasty boys on the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are made for the Cincinnati Reds
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care or know too much about
baseball.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to baseball.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your thing go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very ignorant to sports and baseball
but I love these shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read about them to see why they said
nasty boys on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Cincinnati Reds team from one
year that there were three or four players
[SPEAKER_00]: that just kicked ass and took the team to
the championship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go team go team.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why the shoes are called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I read the word Cincy I put nasty
at the end of it because they were the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cincinnati Reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the nasty boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all that math came through in
my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope I didn't offend you by calling you
Cincy nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I have another friend who goes by
Cincy nasty on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was just embedded in my
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Cincy nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're well bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't heard from you in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posts a lot of great graffiti pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not do the graffiti.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posts the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't go painting shit that's not
yours unless you're really talented.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read this message from my buddy Cincy loco
or Cincy crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me kind of find the meat because
there's a lot of stuff that's just for me
[SPEAKER_00]: and not for you guys in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says good evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great podcast this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you did an amazing job of
breaking down all of the questions so
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone can understand first of all that
is a huge compliment because I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that not everybody learns in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a hands on learner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated school but I love to learn if that
makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the kind of teacher that just
sits there and reads from a book and
[SPEAKER_00]: expects me to follow along and then learn
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bored about a page and especially if
you've got an annoying voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about other stuff what I'm
going to do when I get out of your dumb
[SPEAKER_00]: ass class.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a fun entertaining teacher if
you can let me touch some things and play
[SPEAKER_00]: with them and try to break stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rebuild it then I'm going to learn
some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you see that I try to
teach from a lot of different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I kind of repeat myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why some things I beat it into the
ground because still some people I'll give
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you a hundred times that day one
is when you flip the plants to twelve
[SPEAKER_00]: twelve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's day one and I'll still get twenty
four emails asking when is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to say things a lot of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it has been really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so he talks about a grow that
he's working on that we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says so he's doing a little bit of
breeding and he's talking about his
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question is since these plants
are autos I'm wondering is it better to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a taller plant with a lot of bud
separation so everything gets light or as
[SPEAKER_00]: a smaller bushier your plant better for
THC production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's asking about phenotypical
expression of the shape of the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering which will give better THC
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now unfortunately I do not have an answer
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the traits of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably grow a hundred seeds of
the cross that you made and you could find
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty five squat plants and twenty five
tall plants and you're going to find
[SPEAKER_00]: different ratios of cannabinoids through
those phenotypes especially since you've
[SPEAKER_00]: created.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really it's kind of an F1 it's
kind of a poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find the I said poly
hybrid excuse me for that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a huge mix of progeny in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really not sure taller plant with a
lot of bud separation so everything gets
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a smaller bushier plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are going to prefer a shorter
bushier plant if you're making seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: share with people sell to people they're
going to want the shorter bushier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are growing indoors a large
percent of the people growing indoors are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people are going to want shorter
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to make sense for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they sacrifice that short bushy
faster flowering time for the THC potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they and I think they understand that I
think that they know that that is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gamble.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion I think that you get a
better potency from a photo period plant
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't have anything to back that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just from from what I've seen and I
don't really have any science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I'm talking out of my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says does this matter at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the autos will get you faded but
not as heavily as the regular photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants we have grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that statement backed up what I
was just trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is growing autos and photos
and he says those autos get him faded but
[SPEAKER_00]: not as much as the photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The autos are kind of in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those photo periods they got all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to build up potency
build up the hormones and the precursors
[SPEAKER_00]: to make that potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says my goal has two parts with
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on is to increase the THC and have
plants that yield well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's number two is plants
that yield well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: High potency high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a good lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks good on the label looks good on
the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to buy it and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if there's a lot of it and it's a
lot of that shit and make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a good goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says which Fino will help me reach that
goal more quickly the tall Fino or the
[SPEAKER_00]: short Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have no way to predict that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't have a way to predict
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things you could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take the taller Fino and the
shorter Fino and get a lab test of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one of them gives you a higher THC
percentage then breed to that when you've
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously got a higher THC start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got that incredible ingredient
that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good way to set yourself up
for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the ingredient you're looking for
is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do I would select a male
and I would pollinate both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds like a lot of work
but you just put the one male plant next
[SPEAKER_00]: to your tall Fino next to your short Fino
and you let them do their magic right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them finish get the seeds out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are probably going to take six
to eight weeks to finish cut the both
[SPEAKER_00]: plants down label them tall and skinny and
short and squatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow as many of the seeds as you can from
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow those seeds under scientifically
controlled conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow 50 or 100 tall and lanky seeds and
grow 50 to 100 short and squatty seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act like you got two little kids in the
room and if you give one one extra fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: cheese it they're going to throw a fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act like you got little kids in the room
and feed them and treat them all exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same and then see which do you like
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're going to find out that that
THC isn't exactly what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of them has a turp that really
fucks you up and gets you right where you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always about the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something really important to keep
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find a cannabinoid combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find a few things that mix
together in one of those phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_00]: really blast you just the way you need to
get blasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's like what the breeders
discover for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the opportunity to breed and grow
so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find something unique to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we discover that when we share it
it's unique to a lot of people and they
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't focus too much on finding THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on finding a very balanced plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant that grows well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant that produces well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got some terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point of having a plant that
grows a lot of buds and gets you really
[SPEAKER_00]: high if when you smoke it it tastes like
you're smoking burnt pubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enjoyable no matter how high it
gets me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not going to smoke your buds that
smell and taste like burnt pubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have some good terps to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of other things to think
about that go along with that THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand the desire for THC and
high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get high and you want a lot of
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to get some other things in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would breed to both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take both of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got seeds of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is something that you can do early on
to help you decide how to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever thought about predicative
testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can plant as many a population of seeds
from both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got short and squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross to your male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross to your male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got those seeds growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get little test kits that you can
basically open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfold a match book and you rub part of
the leaf tissue on the match book and you
[SPEAKER_00]: close it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put a number on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short and squat plant number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short and squat plant number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label each one according to what plant
number you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send those tests off to a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tell you if that plant is a male
or a female, which is a great thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already can eliminate the plants we
don't need if we're looking for males and
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also detect the presence of
cannabinoid precursors, which means they
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell you if those plants later on in
their life will develop high THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: high CBD, high THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can dictate and predict all of the
cannabinoids that may be present in that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in very, very low concentrations
and low ratios at this time, but they know
[SPEAKER_00]: that if the presence of this cannabinoid
and this other, I'm not sure the detectors
[SPEAKER_00]: and the markers on the test, but they can
say this plant has potential for being a
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC potency plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tell you that when the plants are
three, four, five or six inches tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't have to waste a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your main goal is for potency,
you can send in a lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of new science
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new way and a backwards way of
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send in a lab test, then they will
send you back the numbers, find the
[SPEAKER_00]: outliers within those populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for high THC and
you've got 50 plants, find the top 10 THC
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in those tests and get rid of the
other 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your 10 highest THC potency
females left from each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you just went from a hundred plants
down to 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that these are all gonna be
high THC, highly potent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we grow them, we flower them out,
we finish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we look for all of the other
traits which we may desire to make those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants what we want for the market,
for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know they're gonna have high
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we find the one with the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we find the one that doesn't get
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we find the one that grows the way we
want it to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it grow tall and skinny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it grow short and squat?
[SPEAKER_00]: You find the one that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there one that tastes amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a couple of them taste like burnt pubes
like we talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you already know that what you've got
is all high potency plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna have the potency you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we just gotta find the other markers
in that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another option is predicated
testing to remove the outliers or include
[SPEAKER_00]: the outliers from a population,
then select from those that will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely minimize population quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have access and funding
for that type of lab, what you would do is
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them dude, grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any other phenohunt and smoke
them, smoke them yourself, smoke them with
[SPEAKER_00]: your friends and see what turns heads and
what gets attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will know some stuff will definitely
turn some heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff will get ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be completely different for you and
your crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, maybe sometimes you'll
create some shit that everybody goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've been at concerts before and lit
up a joint and I've had everybody for 50
[SPEAKER_00]: feet turn and look at me like,
what the fuck are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all wanted to buy seeds or buy an
eighth off me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all circled around like vultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know you hit gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you light up some weed and you
try to pass it to your friends and they
[SPEAKER_00]: go, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells like you're smoking your
fingernails over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you smoke some shit that you're
like, I'm not super fond of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you smoke it with one of your friends
and they're like, dude, I've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: medical problem that I've had my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I smoke that shit, I feel
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, when I smoked it,
I didn't notice anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a turp, a cannabinoid,
a compound in there that works beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: for something they've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always beautiful to find because
then you give them a clone of that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or you give them seeds or whatever and
you're like, here you go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your magic medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that feels good that you've helped out
a friend for the rest of their fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found relief from something that
bugged them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even know you made their
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that happen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real answer here, the only real
way to know this is to grow out these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would cross the male to the shortened
squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would cross the male, the selected male,
one male, pick one dude that you really
[SPEAKER_00]: like, pick one dude and pollinate all of
the plants, the squatty and the tall one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate both of those with the same
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those seeds, clearly label them and
grow them both under the same conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and see how you like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to find out is to run
the plants, run the mix and see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're just kind of guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no way of telling you like which is
going to have higher THC by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to smoke it, maybe run it
through a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind again, I know I've said
this, but I just want to stress this part
[SPEAKER_00]: because this we all get consumed by lab
reports and lab numbers and terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: reports and test results and all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's something that I said the other
day in a live chat and all the growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: there laughed pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a liquid chromatography
machine come back and try to buy another
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how high the lab report was,
none of those machines have ever called me
[SPEAKER_00]: and hit me up for another eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make any sense to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: People buy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing weed for machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: People smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People smoke dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not high pressure liquid chromatography
machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can impress those machines very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to manipulate a lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get high fucking numbers if we
really, really wanted to push it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could really push it to where people
are showing up at the grow going,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get CNN there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be hard to manipulate a lab
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the numbers are just like if you
smoke it and it doesn't get you where you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be, it could say 100% THC on the
label and it doesn't matter to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have some terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have a few other things to get
my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke all the weed I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to the store and I can buy two
ounces today and two ounces tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can smoke two ounces by myself in
a day, I got to get better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is I can smoke all the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get as fucked up as we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need it to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most important parts to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke bad tasting herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herb that burns my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herb that makes my tongue feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why smoke that shit when there's good
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is don't focus too much on the
numbers because the machines aren't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to come by another eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people are going to come by another
eighth and they're the ones that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to say, damn, that smells skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, that was super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, that tastes like bubblegum and
popsicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that are going to come
back with some money, not the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't focus too much on those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my main point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get my high ass back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I've been smoking something
fucking good today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cincy Loco, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I answered this honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one will help me get to that goal
quicker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't harp too much on that part,
but when you're breeding, don't focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to the goal more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on getting the goal accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fast tracking and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing it the fast way will get you fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to fuck it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it the quick way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow from your heart, breathe with
love, and take your time, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some love and art into your art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some love, skill, some passion,
and do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do two plants side by
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to take you much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part will be growing both of
them, but it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to take a bunch of notes,
which we're going to talk about in a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I'd prefer, let's see,
Cincy Loco or Cincy Nasty would be
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he asked what gave me the nasty vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to do with any of the things that
you listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I explained that a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all stemmed from a pair of shoes from
the Cincinnati Reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triggered my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the ADD going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of ADD, it is time to wrap up
this podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Cincy, thank you for the great
message, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for
listening to another episode of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six hundred and seventy six episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking tremendous to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done anything else six hundred
and seventy six times successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening, hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pointed out recently that episode
710 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do for episode 710?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to take some dabs or do something,
