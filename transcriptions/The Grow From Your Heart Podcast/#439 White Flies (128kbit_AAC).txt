[SPEAKER_00]: You know it has become a tradition that we
start this podcast off by talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog
Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms The label says this product contains
64.7% THC and 76.4% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog is one of my favorite strains to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also one of my favorite strains to
grow, and I absolutely love the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the Stardog Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright podcast world, in this episode I'm

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, in this episode I am going to
read an email about whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I would like to talk
about something I saw in the news
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I saw a report of a young lady
dying from cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to come on this podcast and call
complete bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That young lady did not die because of
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know that lady's medical history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I know is that this person
died and the coroner found THC in her
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he then decided that cannabis is what
killed this lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call complete bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this medical examiner is
blaming cannabis because he can't find the
[SPEAKER_00]: true cause of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think he may be blaming
cannabis so that he can catch a little
[SPEAKER_00]: spotlight time for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he finds the very first cannabis
related death, that will put him in some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of medical book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will put some news on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the doctor right now,
even though I won't say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is getting a little bit of spotlight
time because of this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may be taking that opportunity to get a
little attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he may be on the other team.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may be against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a good way to kind of
throw cannabis under the bus is to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the very first death caused by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he would be able to fight for the other
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be able to get a little bit of
notoriety and he would also have a cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: an explanation for this young lady's
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: From everything else I read, there is not
a reasonable cause of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he simply states that he believes
cannabis is what did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to try to explain why you
cannot OD from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not work on the parts of your body
that make you shut down and make you die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are different drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could die from cannabis,
it would have happened a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself and many of my friends would have
been victims several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know anything about this young
lady's medical history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about her health
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about her life or
her habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was not an old person.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was not a sick person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really all that any of the
articles listed would mention about her.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real details we got was that she
was dead and that she had THC in her
[SPEAKER_00]: system and that the coroner was blaming it
on the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's tragic and terrible and
anybody dies, but sometimes people just
[SPEAKER_00]: die without explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There doesn't have to be a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes part of your body just goes,
hey, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your car breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your computer gives up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a light bulb burns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies are made of a bunch of
different connecting parts and when one
[SPEAKER_00]: decides to shut down, it can shut down the
whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what killed this young
lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't believe the coroner
knows what killed this young lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I am certain of, this lady did
not die because she had THC in her system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what the news tells you,
no matter what this report tells you,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are still zero deaths linked to
cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send my love and my condolences
to this young lady's family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible that she's been brought into
the news and into the spotlight in such a
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible way, but I send my love,
I send my heart out to her, her family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send a big middle finger to this
coroner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think he's just trying to get
some spotlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure if this is the end of this
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he can just say cannabis
caused this and then somewhere in some
[SPEAKER_00]: record book, it now says that there is an
official cannabis death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that there is more investigation,
more to be proven before that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: marked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to stay updated on that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into this email about
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some help and you are the best
resource I know for all things cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to read this on the show if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we go, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to read this on the show right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've been bested by whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you a little background on my
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in a reasonably sized cabinet,
six foot by two foot, divided into two by
[SPEAKER_00]: two and four by two spaces and a two by
two grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my mother's in the two by two
cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow out clones in the two by two flower
and the four by two all in soil with led
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this is in my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a nice little compact
perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says about two or two and a half months
ago, I found whiteflies in my flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked off every affected leaf and put
out a bunch of sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the right start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shook the plants three to four times a
day and vacuumed up what flew off,
[SPEAKER_00]: which got me through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far that is an effective strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about whiteflies really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies are really easy to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are little whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like flying pieces of ash in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pull off a leaf and turn it upside
down, it looks like a piece of rice or
[SPEAKER_00]: probably bunches of pieces of rice on the
bottom of your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you shake the plants, when you tap
the pots, if white things come flying out,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy said he shook the plants three to
four times a day and vacuumed up what flew
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very effective strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those whiteflies want to fly up toward the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you shake the plant, you disrupt
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice and comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging out in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, oh, what the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go flying up toward the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to go fly until all the
disruption stops and they'll go land back
[SPEAKER_00]: on their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they're flying, get the shot vac and
just shot vac the shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the long attachment on the shot vac
and I would just point that right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: light and just kind of move back and forth
as those bugs fly up at the light and just
[SPEAKER_00]: get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get in there and kind of
tap the buds with the shot vac and just
[SPEAKER_00]: smack it, you're using that long wand
attachment, just smack some of the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: with that and then the bugs will go flying
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just suck them up right as they
come flying out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remove a lot of the excess foliage,
the whiteflies have less places to hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out, less places for breeding,
make it less desirable in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, now with everything in veg,
I went to the grow store and got the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations of my local guy and
treated with a rosemary extract pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did a soil soak and foliar spray on
all three spaces and I sprayed down all
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a pesticide that was
recommended by a grow store person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you did a soil soak and a foliar
spray on all of your spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you treated all of the plants that were
in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you also sprayed down all surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good plan of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good strategy, but I honestly
don't think that the rosemary extract
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide is going to be strong enough to
eradicate whiteflies at the level which
[SPEAKER_00]: you have got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got a serious infestation and
something like a rosemary extract works
[SPEAKER_00]: better as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it kind of undesirable for
the pests and they're already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have made themselves comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to get enough
coverage with this rosemary extract to run
[SPEAKER_00]: them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it seemed to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recommended holding off on moving
anything into flower and treat a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: a week for a few weeks to make sure the
whiteflies are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything seemed to be going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treated for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut new clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved my current clones to flower and
after a week under 1212, I found more
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to address right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, you started with a pesticide
application that was not strong enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: the infestation you were battling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you did not really have a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you knocked them down,
but there were still eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to break the life cycle of the
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to disrupt multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can guarantee that the pests are
gone, but you were using something that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't knock out all stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you made a crucial mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You applied the same pesticide multiple
times a week for multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You applied the same pesticide multiple
times a week for multiple times a week for
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the third week, those whiteflies were
laughing at that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going, ha ha, we drink that shit
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bugs that are now in your room
have built up a resistance to that
[SPEAKER_00]: rosemary extract pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your main crucial mistake was using one
pesticide over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to rotate products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need multiple different products so
that you can prevent that resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also need the appropriate
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were basically just giving them a
bubble bath after a while and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: just laughing at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, the plants are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're under 1212 and we have discovered
more whiteflies one week into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says they are in all three spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, those whiteflies get around quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They breed rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies are a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get out of control really quickly,
but we are going to help you get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I trashed all of my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trimmed up my mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I vacuumed the spaces out and I tried
insecticidal soap on the mothers and empty
[SPEAKER_00]: grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it seemed to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they were gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut new clones and this week they're
back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that insecticidal soap and that
rosemary oil are not going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to step up our game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to go nuclear pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed a bag of diatomaceous earth and
I've dusted everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked today and the bottoms of my
leaves are loaded with whitefly larva once
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a nuclear solution to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what else to try other than
bug bombs in each grow space and I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: the mothers survive to cut clones from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you recommend anything that would be a
sure fire way to wipe out my whiteflies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again from Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Dan, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bad you got whiteflies,
but let's talk about getting rid of those
[SPEAKER_00]: bad motherfuckers for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies can be a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, they come on quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They breed quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread from room to room rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you know how to get rid of them,
they can be a complete pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about eradicating whiteflies in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I like is you only have
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to think about treating
plants that are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about treating flowering
plants, but it's going to help you out a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot that you can apply just about anything
at this point because you have got veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any buds to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is truly advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of growers, a lot of
facilities are doing it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards when it comes to pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: They focus on treating the flowering
plants for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the priority for pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go to the large veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go to the small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go to the tiny stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go to the moms and they worry
about the moms dead last when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go the complete opposite
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to worry about pest, pathogen,
problem-free mother plants and work my way
[SPEAKER_00]: forward through the grow with a good
healthy start.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, IPM starts in the mother
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it works all the way through the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts in the mother room just like all
of the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you've got nothing but mother
plants to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts you ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I would do is work
on sealing up my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are those bugs coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tiny but they're finding a way in
and they're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure out where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal up the grow space a little bit more
securely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to defoliate heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off any leaf you don't think you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get rid of all of the breeding
space, all the hangout spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to remove all the space for these
fucking white flies to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take away all the free parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just chop it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that out of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said this is in your basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it as far away from your house as you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of all these white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just evict them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So defoliate heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliate to the point that you're worried
about those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow more leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as those plants are mostly
healthy, they will recover from the
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will like being defoliated more than
they like being a host for white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strip off any extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strip off all the giant fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need all that shit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't high performance plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are mother plants that we're just
trying to make survive at this point in
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So defoliate heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your next thing to think about is stepping
up your spray regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things you're spraying right now have
basically become Kool-Aid for the white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest a stronger pesticide
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is where you have a few moral
decisions to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: How strong of a pesticide do you want to
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay on the Colorado Department
of Agriculture approved pesticide list for
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to maintain that standard in any
grow I work in, whether it be a home grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be a commercial grow,
I still try to adhere to those standards
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make it a habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't want to use any
pesticides that are not OMRI certified
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you spray on your plants is
ultimately your decision, but also you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to live with what you've done to
those plants and what you are giving to
[SPEAKER_00]: other people to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you can live with yourself
and you feel okay with what you have done,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can apply whatever you're comfortable
with to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this message, you said you're ready to
go nuclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully scheduled sprayed pesticide
applications will be the quickest and
[SPEAKER_00]: simplest way to eradicate these bugs,
but we can't just keep spraying forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to eradicate them and figure
out how they got in there and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a few products we can
apply to our plants to make sure we get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of these white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we can start with is Azimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azimax has multiple modes of attack to
make sure these bugs don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully when you're working with Azimax,
you're wearing a glove, but if you've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: touched it, you'll notice that it is quite
oily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We apply that oily consistency to the
bottom of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs don't want to be on that oily
consistency, so it makes it undesirable
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as an added bonus, there is
azadirachtin in the Azimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works as a stomach poison,
so any pest that does eat your leafy
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage they will get a tummy ache,
they will stop eating, and they will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I can recommend for you is
Evergreen Pyrethrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a very similar product called
Pyganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very similar products,
but they do have different application
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are used to using one or the
other, make sure you read the bottle and
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust your application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those products are very oily and
very sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're going to apply those to
the bottom, the underside of the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: where we see all those eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we apply a nice coat of oily surface,
those bugs don't want to go there,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to hang out, they don't
want to breed, and will also suffocate the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, then we can also suffocate their
eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we use Evergreen or Pyganic,
our first mode of attack is to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: undesirable environment by making it
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also suffocating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also the added bonus of the
Pyrethrum in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that does take a bite out of
the leaf, it is going to get a tummy ache
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are both very affordable products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very affordable and readily
available product is something called
[SPEAKER_00]: Monterey Garden Spray with Spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you call it Spinosad or
Spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, that shit works to get rid of
white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinosad is a fungus that is created in
the bottom of whiskey or rum barrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it is the bottom of a whiskey
barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is naturally occurring and for some
reason, it kills the shit out of white
[SPEAKER_00]: flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a product called Monterey
Garden Spray and it will say Spinosad
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I can recommend for you,
we're starting to get a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're starting to get a little more
dangerous, a little less gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I'll recommend is
something called Venerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Venerate will wipe the shit out of almost
every pest in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I can recommend for white
flies is Botanigard ES and I also like a
[SPEAKER_00]: product called BioSeer WP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those products contain a
beneficial fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to remember the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually called Buveria Basioma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very good at destroying white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you really want to step up your
game, a really expensive product that will
[SPEAKER_00]: work to help you get rid of your white
flies is a product called Mycotrol ESO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be forewarned, that one is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how nuclear you want to go,
but that is a nice list of products that
[SPEAKER_00]: will work to eradicate your white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whatever you choose to use to get rid
of these bugs, make sure you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray the same product every three
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray one product on day one, apply a
different product on day four,
[SPEAKER_00]: apply a different product on day seven if
you can, then start the rotation over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't do the same product more than
two times in a row, no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how you start giving these pests a
resistance to the products you're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bugs are going to get stronger and
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to create superbugs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do is you can tank
mix multiple pesticides in an applicator
[SPEAKER_00]: at one time, as long as those products are
compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you go mixing a large batch of
pesticide, if you're going to do a tank
[SPEAKER_00]: mix of multiple pesticides you've never
ran together before, I suggest mixing a
[SPEAKER_00]: very small batch of them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you get any weird chemical
reactions out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get any weird reactions,
mix up the desired amount which you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to apply to your plants, then pick one
sacrificial plant and spray the shit out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if that one plant does any weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't harm that plant,
you've got a great mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your new pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down exactly what went in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down how much water you started
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down how much whatever product you
put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down how much of the other product
you put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down when you sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down what you saw from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We consume cannabis so we forget a lot of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you write things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a great lesson on mixing
multiple pesticides, then one spray
[SPEAKER_00]: applicator for one good application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend an episode I did called
Tank Mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is episode number 289 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about mixing pesticides and
proper pesticide application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of spray pesticide
application options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I would recommend is a root
drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the products I recommended are
also usable as a drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that maybe some of the larvae from
your whiteflies has ended up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're having a hard time
getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got eggs just chilling down there
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend a root drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably use the evergreen or the
azimax or the botanogard and I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: mix that into some water and I would soak
the roots thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it soak out through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you've got pesticide in your
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go nuclear like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to leave any open space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the leaves coated in nasty
stickiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that medium coated in nasty
stickiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not make it a desirable environment
for these whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you do a root drench,
you do need to make sure not to suffocate
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever your recommended dosage is for
your foliar spray, I would probably reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the root drench application to about half
of whatever you are spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're spraying 10 milliliters of a
product, I would root drench with five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always root drench again with the
increased dosage, but you can't un-drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once those roots are coated in an oil
and you 've got a problem, you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fucked, so go light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if that doesn't do it, go harder next
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, write everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we need to do is continue
with the yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those yellow sticky traps are going to let
us know how the population is sustaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll know if there are less, if there are
more whiteflies than there were before.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important thing is to change those
sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave the same trap up for too
long, how do you know how many flies were
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered at one point in time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you rotate them on a frequent
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a week is probably enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have heavily defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken all that foliage out of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as far away as we can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have burned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have applied ridiculous amounts of
pesticides on a routine schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spraying every three days and we're
rotating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're possibly doing a tank mix with
multiple pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to knock down the
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to do a root drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to make sure that none of
the larvae, none of the eggs are chilling
[SPEAKER_00]: in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've in theory destroyed all of the
bugs we're trying to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do to make sure they
don't come back?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like the first step is to seal
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is to think of an integrated
pest management strategy that will make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we don't get these bugs back when we
are late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to get rid of these bugs
with our mother plants, with our veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, because we can just go spraying
every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we've got buds, we can't spray
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to do to make sure we
don't get bugs later in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I like to introduce predator
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider mites, thrips, fungus gnats,
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what kind of bug you are,
you cannot build a resistance to being
[SPEAKER_00]: eaten by a predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have eradicated your
infestation and you're sure that 99.9% of
[SPEAKER_00]: these whiteflies are gone, I would switch
my strategy and invest heavily in predator
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are at a point where you have only
got mother plants and or veg plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are at a huge advantage to start with
predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great time to start building
colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can purchase enough predator bugs to
build a large enough colony to overtake
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of invaders that may try to come
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start with your moms and your veg
plants, the idea would be to get enough
[SPEAKER_00]: predator insects on those veg plants where
when you take clones, you move some
[SPEAKER_00]: predators right along with the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those veg plants start to grow and
those predator insects will colonize on
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg plants, their party and their
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're breeding, they're living life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just colonizing and they're
expanding with the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become a part of the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You create a symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get bug A, bug B will come along
and say, hey, look, a bunch of these and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll either move along or they'll
try to colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get too much, if they get too
comfortable, if they get too fancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: bug C will come along and say,
nah bro, this is our territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll eat bug B and they'll run them
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those bugs will either move along
to the next garden and keep playing
[SPEAKER_00]: security that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they'll repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll try to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll run out of bugs to eat and they'll
die or they'll leave or something will
[SPEAKER_00]: come and eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can replicate that in our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use a well thought out integrated
pest management strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something you're going to have to be
careful with is, are the pesticides you
[SPEAKER_00]: are using going to endanger your predators
that you're paying money for?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of commercial environments,
I will start the mother rooms and the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms by using pesticide applications as
we move into the later veg rooms and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will begin releasing large amounts of
predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: My budget may be a little bit different
than most people's because I'm working on
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the value of my crop is more
critical than some folks because I am
[SPEAKER_00]: working on a large commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not downplaying the size of your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that we have to be a
little more careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to lose hundreds of pounds
compared to somebody losing one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds in a home girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're out of medicine, but if I lose
hundreds of pounds, people are out of
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs, businesses fail, it is a very huge
loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my strategy is to go very hard on the
moms, go very hard in the veg phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I do not get any pests,
any pathogens, any problems throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in veg or right at the start of
flower, I start adjusting my pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: application schedule to make sure I'm not
applying anything that will be harmful or
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental to my predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to switch to releasing large
ridiculous amounts of predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got that residual pesticide
hanging out for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that starts to degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then by the time all that pesticide breaks
down is no longer active on my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: my predatory mites have had time to
colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a big army in there and I've
still got protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I don't have any chance for
spider mites or anything like that to come
[SPEAKER_00]: take a hold in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a couple of options for this
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either start by letting the
predatory mites go in the mom room,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them in the veg room, get them started
early, get them colonizing, or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start with pesticides early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you move to the flowering phase,
when it's no longer a good idea to spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start releasing your predatory
mites and start working things that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a few things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think with all the information I
have given you, we should be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of those white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more specifically about some of
the predatory bugs that you could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to get out of here
for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate lace wings in a
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like lace wings are hungry and
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am most familiar with the lace wings
that come in the eggs that are on the
[SPEAKER_00]: black sheet that you hang in different
locations throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what I'm most familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to watch them come alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn into a little crocodile looking
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually they turn into a green
lace wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so hungry that I believe they
become carnivorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will eat every pest in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will turn on their friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green lace wings are awesome in any
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next predatory mite that I would
recommend that works on a plethora of
[SPEAKER_00]: garden pests is the swarsky predatory
mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I release swarsky mites on a regular basis
in any commercial grow environment that I
[SPEAKER_00]: am responsible for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also recommend kookamaras and my new
pirate bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now predatory mites can get a little bit
expensive, but if all you've got are
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants, you have a great
opportunity to start colonies in a small
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now all you've got to do is hang up
some yellow sticky traps, defoliate like a
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucker, do some research on several
pesticides, select the few that work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, create a nice rotation of pesticides,
start applying them diligently until you
[SPEAKER_00]: knock down that population, then decide
how you want to proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to keep going with the
pesticides or are you going to start using
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of predators?
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to seal up that room and
figure out where those bugs are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a very small crack somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have found that crack and they are
making their way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to figure out how to seal
that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we can get rid of these
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies aren't as big of a problem as
they seem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem like they're more of a pain in
the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more annoying than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we stay on top of it, we will get
them out of your garden.
