[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 829 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me start by apologizing for being a
day late with the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a little bit overwhelmed with
the trimmed job with a small harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm caught up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about trimming and
harvesting later in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to cordially invite you to the

[SPEAKER_01]: It is my birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's celebrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I covered all of the business
here at the top of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's segue into the pet peeve section
of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times if you're scrolling the
internet, if you go to your friend's grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space, maybe you work in a commercial
grow, but a lot of times we will see
[SPEAKER_01]: something in a grow environment that will
simply drive you crazy, drive me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call that our grow room pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know about your grow room pet
peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send them to me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your grow room pet peeve here on
the podcast, I will send you a coupon code
[SPEAKER_01]: for a free pack of seeds at AiryDirect
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to discuss one of my
grow room, one of my grow community pet
[SPEAKER_01]: peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy a package of seeds,
it says recommended flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to say 60 to 70 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really common for some seeds that I
would sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So suggested flowering time, 60 to 70
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one that bred those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've probably grown a bunch of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had testers grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of experience with the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are in that package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a pretty good general idea of what
to expect from those, especially how long
[SPEAKER_01]: to let them flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me get to the point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pet peeve is when I see people online
talking about day one of flowering time
[SPEAKER_01]: and what is considered day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people out there who
try to say that day one is the first day
[SPEAKER_01]: you see pistols forming or the first day
you see bud set happening or the first day
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant shows you sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day one of flowering is the day you turn
your timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us are running 18 hours on six
hours off or something similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're doing 24 and zero,
but that first day you turn that timer to
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 hours on and 12 hours off is day one of
the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no negotiations, no changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get to choose that because I created
the seeds that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the label on there and I know that
day one starts for my count when I change
[SPEAKER_01]: that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I put 70 days on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been a different math
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't put day one is the day that you
change the lights plus the day that you
[SPEAKER_01]: see pistols minus the angle of the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says day one is the day you change the
light into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from 70 days from then your
plants should be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my grow room pet peeve is people not
understanding what day one means.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hard is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you making things so difficult?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chill out, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to work into another pet
peeve that does drive me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also see this on social media way too
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will post pictures of male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a boy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is 10, 12, 17 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's showing male parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people will say, why did my plant show
hermaphrodite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is my plant a herm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, it's just a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you want it to be a herm so bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds like a very small
complaint, but what sucks about that is if
[SPEAKER_01]: you run some iry genetic seeds and you
grow a good male and you complain that you
[SPEAKER_01]: got a hermaphrodite and you tell a bunch
of people that my seeds are intersex,
[SPEAKER_01]: that looks bad on me because you're
uneducated and you didn't know what a male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another one of my big pet
peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that identify a male plant as an
intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant was clearly male.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get to pick that, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants do not let you determine their
gender.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will tell you on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my pet peeve section of today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I did say earlier that I've been
overwhelmed because I've been trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: some plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a very long episode about
harvesting and drying and curing your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants here on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the number today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do the quick version of
drying and curing your harvested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the first thing I want to talk about
when it comes to harvesting our plants is
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a full episode recently about
preparing for harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, mainly get your gloves, get your
scissors, get your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, where are these plants going to go
once you chop them down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's think about that before we even cut
these plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know harvest is coming, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say it's in a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the time to order two or three pair
of scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get some good Fiskars scissors
or whatever you prefer, get some good
[SPEAKER_01]: quality scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some free scissors in the mail that
came with another product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just happened to send me scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used those to trim a plant the other
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lasted one and a half plants before
they were so dull that they were just
[SPEAKER_01]: mushing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even trim with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I tried to clean them up, tried to get
them back in action.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so dull.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're useless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need to give them to a friend who is a
sheer sharpener professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but get yourself some good quality
scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause these things did not last one and a
half plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what you expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just grabbed that pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give them a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: They felt good in the hand, but they
didn't trim worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a couple of hours, they were
toasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now is the time to order some good
scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we're going to need good trim
scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've already got some, clean them up,
get them prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you're going to need, or I suggest
rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to have helpers get gloves
in their sizes as well, uh, be cordial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one thing I would recommend is some
snacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want some snacks when
you're trimming, not while, but between
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm a snack monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice reward to say when I
finished this plant, I get to eat those
[SPEAKER_01]: snacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always just a good mind game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trimming, if you've got
helpers, Oh, excuse me for the burping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys not even going to edit that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trimming, if you've got helpers,
try to provide snacks for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I'm burping it up, try to find
some good drinks that your trimmers enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they drink kombuchas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they drink, uh, have some water for
sure, but do they want something tasty?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they want a lime?
[SPEAKER_01]: Haritos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, do they want one of those weird
tasting tamarind haritos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get something tasty for your trim crews.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something good for folks to
snack on and to drink on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep them comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, uh, this always does help in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working in a, an environment
where this is allowed, if you're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial environment, you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you come over here and you trim
with me, you're going to get stoned all
[SPEAKER_01]: day, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put some weed on the table, some dabs on
the table and that shit's fair game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smoke all of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you can still trim,
you will get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have some snacks, some drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some smokables available and some good
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you pick out a couple of good
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're by yourself, uh, maybe you
listen to a couple of comedy specials,
[SPEAKER_01]: but be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and a good chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to mention a good chair is
crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a really nice chair in my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved that to my trim area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and cozy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got nice lumbar support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that chair extends my trim period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also good lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people overlook the good lighting
until they cut down the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bring it to the area and they go,
damn, I can't see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I've got studio lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got lighting for days in here,
but consider some lighting in your
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to be very crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will, um, trimming sucks that you may
be at trimming at the trim table for
[SPEAKER_01]: several hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be stuck there
uncomfortable, uh, with your neck in a
[SPEAKER_01]: position you don't want and your arms in a
weird way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really try to get yourself in a
comfortable, relaxed position where you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get as much done and extend your time
trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your arms are up here, your arms are
going to get numb.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your neck's crooked like this,
your neck is going to get sore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get yourself set up in a
comfortable way where you can trim with
[SPEAKER_01]: your arms in front of your face over a
tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also think about some sort of trim tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to trim over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things to think about
before trimming even happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get some supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get some friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't keep putting it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, don't, uh, just tell your bros
whenever at this time, have a time Friday
[SPEAKER_01]: at noon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cutting these plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You be here at one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the way it should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know, do you have room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I cut down to one of my big plants,
it barely fit on this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I'd have to break it down into
smaller pieces, hang that up and then
[SPEAKER_01]: process that small pieces at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have room for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was the temperature of the environment
in that room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it suitable for yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it suitable for your trim crew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it suitable for the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after the trim area, what about,
where is that bud going to hang?
[SPEAKER_01]: However you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to run lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to hang it from hooks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to hang it from coat
hangers?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going, excuse me, how are you
going to hang this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I like to do, I like to start by
hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk about this in a moment,
but have some space.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you going to hang the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then how are you going to control the
environment in the room in which your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are hanging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, ideally we would have, and this is up
for debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to argue this and I'm
going to give parameters cause it's much
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it is slightly critical to hit
these parameters, but certain exact temps
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't as critical in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing weed, uh, very good weed
before we had all these super crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: monitors and all this tech you can get by.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm trying to say is we need a
room where we can control the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and the humidity, uh, somewhere between 50
and 60% humidity and also somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit in
that room, uh, for as long as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're drying and curing is ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand we don't all have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to get too hot, try not to get too
cold, try not to get too dry, try not to
[SPEAKER_01]: get too moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want really good, the best weed
50 to 60% on both of those is ideal for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about the area where the weed is
going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I normally do it is I'm going
to cut the weed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll hang for a few days in that 50,
50 room, that 50, 50 environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: that dark room also it's 50 degrees,
50% humidity and it's dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, eventually it'll be time to cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about that in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to skip steps trying to stay
focused, but I am high as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't tell today, um, then
eventually that weeds going to get ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we trim it, where is it going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have jars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have buckets?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have something available that is
airtight, preferably opaque and food grade
[SPEAKER_01]: would be ideal for these buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things to think about,
a lot of steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get prepared now so we don't destroy
this harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already gone however many days in
veg, 30, 40 days in veg, nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 weeks in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not ruin this stuff right here at
the very end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about your equipment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a humidifier, a dehumidifier,
a small fan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have those types of things
available to you to put in your dry and
[SPEAKER_01]: cure area?
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said time and space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've got all of your equipment,
I wrote down a humidifier, dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_01]: fans, scissors, gloves, jars, bins,
snacks, music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what about time and space?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to organize this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about that briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that you may need to be
concerned about is once you cut those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants down, they are beginning to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point they will be dry enough to
where they need to be either put into a
[SPEAKER_01]: container or ready to be trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I got overwhelmed this week is
because I cut down several plants all at
[SPEAKER_01]: one time and then they were all dry all at
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a race for me to get them into a
container, into the jars before they got
[SPEAKER_01]: too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just once I started trimming it was
fucking go time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to keep on keeping on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give yourself time and space to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also think about that hang area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote temperature and humidity in the
hang area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that is dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about my actual process of
how I did this harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I did this harvest pretty
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took down my legal number of plants here
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I had a pretty good successful
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, most of this is going to be
taken to the Dude Grows Cup so we can
[SPEAKER_01]: consume this at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be rolled up into a bunch of
fatties or just available in jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to be smoke ready at the
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just party time bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bunch of lemon Jeffrey,
a little bit of orangegasm, a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: amount, small small amount of Grateful
Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a double dragon in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then allegedly there might be a golden
goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're just talking at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the actual harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've done your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to talk too much about
what you feed it if you do or do not
[SPEAKER_01]: flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, there's an episode all about
flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is flushing real?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is flushing a myth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is flushing bro science?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check the flushing episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how you feel about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that or don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, I would say the day before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is where my harvest procedure
actually begins.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because days before that I hit up Amazon
and got all the shit that I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go in and defoliate the
plants as much as I possibly can the day
[SPEAKER_01]: before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: As many leaves as I can pull off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big and small.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can just get in there and yank them
off with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going to strip it naked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need any leaves at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be completely completely naked at
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I'm done, there's a good chance
I'll just unplug that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unplug the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the entire room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cut it down tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like to leave that room in
extended darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing it because the plants are
basically finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to let them sleep for an
extra amount of time because I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: spinning that electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if that extra extended darkness
does do anything, I also happen to add
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know I'm cutting them down
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just defoliated them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just need to let them finish for that
extra day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow was chop day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only real method for the
extended darknesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just unplug the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need for it at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let them rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a real long night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you wake them up and kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I do, defoliate heavily
every leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it off of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the leaves you're pulling now are
not the sugary leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the next day when it's time,
I will go in and I chop the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these plants got lollipop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had real long legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't chop at the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chopped up real high just before where
the first nodes came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just chopped just below that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I flipped the plant upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants honestly went onto a coat
hanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hanger that my t-shirt was on,
my jacket, my hoodie, just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take one of the branch so your plant
goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a peace sign, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The main branch and the two coming off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use one side of the peace sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang it right on that coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That went into my dry and cure area that
was as close to 50-50 as I could get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 degrees, 50% humidity, and 100%
darkness in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant went right into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Repeat until everything is harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then closely monitor those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to your equipment in that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to the humidifier,
the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're dumping those or filling
those as needed because if one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: goes to shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's something crazy that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mention this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the dry and cure room, I will have a
humidifier and a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both set at 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or both set at 55%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you get, honestly, these devices
have a little leeway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get somewhere between 50 and 60%
humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way they're both fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason you got to make sure they're
both up to date is because if one goes
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong, you really fuck up the room because
now you're just dehumidifying the room
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of adding the humidity,
it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure your equipment's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang everything upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it hang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in there and check on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's where the art and the skill
comes into drying and curing the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the plants are hanging, grab a
branch and just give it a bend.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's either going to bend like it's
wet and rubbery and supple or it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to pop a little bit or it's going to
explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are three different points of the
dry and cure phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it bends a little bit and is rubbery
way too early, if it goes crack,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just at the right point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start trimming up those buds and
get those buds into an airtight container
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least buck the buds off of the
sticks and into an airtight container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did half and half this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bucked the buds into a bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trimmed up a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those went into a jar so I can dry and
cure them.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, I realized I was running
out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started bucking the buds off of the
sticks and I put those untrimmed buds into
[SPEAKER_01]: a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will get dried and cured with leaves
on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can trim those whenever the time comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they start snapping, when they
start popping a little bit, that's when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's time to start getting those buds,
those flowers, even the whole plant if you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to, into some sort of a container to
now start slowing down that drying
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some people, this line is hard to
determine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When to put them in that jar is really
hard to determine for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to go when it's too wet
because then you can cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's already exploding and real dry,
then you've already caused yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to go right when those,
not the thin, thin wispy sticks,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the big stick in the middle,
but those side sticks, when those start
[SPEAKER_01]: popping good, that's when you want to get
those buds off of there and get them into
[SPEAKER_01]: a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've taken the, so what I did was
like I said, I cut all the buds off the
[SPEAKER_01]: sticks and do containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew that this plant was bin A,
this plant was bin B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I trimmed a bunch of those buds and
put them into the jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are basically trimmed and in the
trimmed cure process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about the curing in a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all set aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, I ran out of freaking
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got tired, bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did more than I thought I was going to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are still hairy, but they got
put into the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trimmed off the stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fuzzy, but they're in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just drying and curing like
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can cut those leaves off later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we are at this point in
the dry and cure phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get those buds into those jars
before they're too dry, we are in good
[SPEAKER_01]: shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are on the right path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where we have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are sealing wet, spongy, squishy,
fluffy buds into an airtight container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now inside of that container is all of the
great shit to cause the curing reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also what's in that container is all
of the wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: To cause a moldy reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to find a balance here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've got to do is pop these jars
open and let out all that stale air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happening is quick version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are sealing that jar up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moisture inside of that jar is working
with the oxygen inside of that jar to
[SPEAKER_01]: start breaking down the chlorophyll inside
of that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the moisture is necessary to break down
the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will break down that chlorophyll into a
gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point we must open the jar and let
that gas out and let fresh oxygen into
[SPEAKER_01]: that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick is we cannot let out all of the
moisture rapidly as we do this because the
[SPEAKER_01]: only way to remove the chlorophyll from
these buds is with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture in them still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to slowly remove that
chlorophyll by sealing that product in the
[SPEAKER_01]: jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting that curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a word for it that my brain won't
say right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to let that curing action
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to let that chlorophyll,
that oxygen, that water battle it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to let that chlorophyll become a
gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let that gas back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we seal it back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to let that happen multiple
times slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what I would like to do,
ideally, and this is going to be hard for
[SPEAKER_01]: some people, but I've got access to my
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, if you're a commercial
grower, you may need a special employee or
[SPEAKER_01]: a team to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was Mike's job back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Mike, but here's what I'm
going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to seal all of my jars up,
or maybe you're using much larger
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seal those then set a timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally set my first timer for two
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: In two hours, I'm going to go open up
those jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the time to make a huge assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we will know if we put those buds into
those jars way too early, way too late,
[SPEAKER_01]: or right on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things are going to happen in
that first two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moisture is going to move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: If some of the buds were damp and some of
the buds were dry, now they will be even.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the buds were real wet, but the sticks
had a lot of moisture in them,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that moisture is going to move around
and kind of even itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the buds were dry and the sticks had
moisture, that moisture is going to move
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we will see how wet those buds truly
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we need to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to leave those jars open for a
few minutes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, we just don't want to let
them dry out too dry to where we can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: the anaerobic action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the word I was looking for
earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we can't get the anaerobes to
create the breakdown to eat up that
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to leave it open just to get
some air out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let some moisture out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at the amount of time which you
desire, I would say somewhere between
[SPEAKER_01]: three and maybe 15 to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're real wet, if they're real
soppy, dump them out of the jar and leave
[SPEAKER_01]: that out on the table for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's just sticky and wet,
leave the jar open 15 to 30 minutes or
[SPEAKER_01]: three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to learn this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a skill and an art to develop
based on the amount of moisture in that
[SPEAKER_01]: jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leave it open for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seal it back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set another timer for four hours at this
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: At four hours, repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: How wet is that weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't think it's going to cause any
mold in there, seal it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seal it up for another four hours and then
go check on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think it's too moist, too damp,
too sticky, too gooey at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: leave it open a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want the buds in there to be
spongy and gross, but we want them damp
[SPEAKER_01]: and sticky so that we can slowly dry them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The object here is slow dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to stretch out this dry process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to put them in the jar and
leave them in that jar until that gas is
[SPEAKER_01]: eating up the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we've got to let that chlorophyll
out and replace it with fresh oxygen to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep repeating that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I continue with the timer process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little bit OCD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go two hours, then I'll go four hours
a couple of times and then six hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: then eight hours and then eventually 12
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually you only have to open
them every day once at a time and for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of minutes by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of guys put hygrometers in
their jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get to a certain point of
moisture, which you desire, once you get
[SPEAKER_01]: to that 63%, you can leave those jars
sealed if you're comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that herb should smoke fairly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Colorado, it's a real struggle to
get the herb perfect because we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: that dry climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone talks about that Colorado crunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if you're down in the South,
it's going to take a little more time to
[SPEAKER_01]: get your stuff dry because you've got all
that humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks have to set their weed out on
the table for a minute before they can
[SPEAKER_01]: even smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you set it out too long here,
it turns to dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you set it out too long in Mississippi,
it gets too wet to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind, everything I'm talking
about, you've got to adapt and adjust this
[SPEAKER_01]: to your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's got that perfect climate
controlled room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's got that perfect state in
their house and their commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to adjust
everything and the plants are the boss
[SPEAKER_01]: still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to the moisture level
when you're popping those sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're gooey, wait a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a commercial facility and you're
going to have to leave overnight,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may need to stay late tonight and put
those plants into a container as late as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that plenty of times,
but try to wait till the perfect moment
[SPEAKER_01]: until they're not exploding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you went way too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to be gummy and rubbery.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to just crack just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the perfect time to put those buds
into a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm checking my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did write down, if your buds
in your jars do get a little bit too dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: here is a way to reconstitute and
re-moisten them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend letting them get too
dry, but this is a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab one fresh leaf off of a plant and put
one fresh leaf inside of your jar and seal
[SPEAKER_01]: it up for about two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just two hours will be enough for a mason
jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then take that leaf out of there and check
the moisture of that bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to leave that jar open for a
little bit, close it up, let that moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: constitute, move around what's called
equalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then check on your product after about an
hour again and see what you need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one leaf will moisturize your
plants way more than you're anticipating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said two hours, maybe I should have
just said one because a lot of people on
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet really have a hard time with
details and instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: After one hour with that leaf in there,
go check on it because then people will
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck up and extend their time and they'll
still be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so real quickly, here is my
rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I went really quickly, but it
doesn't have to be as difficult as a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people want to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prepare yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your room prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% humidity to 60% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the room is
ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a little bit off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that not every grower has
got the perfect environment, but
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that way too warm is going to
dry that weed way too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will get harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will taste funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will also be detrimental to your
turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get your environment, get your gear,
defoliate everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then chop the plants, hang them up in your
dark room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then eventually they will snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you buck all the buds off,
then jar them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can trim them before or after the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cure process is now starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open and close those jars on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people talk about how stanky weed
is around week seven, eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you put scissors to it,
it's going to be exponentially stanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did say stanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighborhood might know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighbors are going to smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the mailman comes up to the porch,
he might smell your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you order food, they're going to smell
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be prepared for all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to get this far and then
get in trouble because the harvest was too
[SPEAKER_01]: stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a carbon filter,
I would set that up right by where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming if necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to the grow store and they sell
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a product called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I know the name of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just can't say the name of the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an ozone product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have to press pause and research the
name of this fucking product real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the grow store and you ask
them for smell products to eliminate
[SPEAKER_01]: smell, what is it called, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just won't come to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people tear the lid off and
open the jar and tear that paper lid off
[SPEAKER_01]: and leave it sitting open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how you're supposed to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open it up and poke holes in that paper
that's on top of there and then just poke
[SPEAKER_01]: a few holes in the plastic lid and screw
the plastic lid on top of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will last a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boys and girls, I'm going to pause and
research the name of this product because
[SPEAKER_01]: it is driving me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even have to pause and research
it because it came to my head as soon as I
[SPEAKER_01]: started typing smell product in the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is called ONA gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: O N A.
[SPEAKER_01]: ONA gels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would do, I would get that jar
of ONA gel and poke holes straight through
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot and it will last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much longer and set that by the doorway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got a little table by my doorway
for my keys and all that good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just set it right there so that when the
door opens, if somebody walks in,
[SPEAKER_01]: the very first thing they smell is ONA
gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ONA is designed to suck up bad aromas
and odors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes all the molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand the fucking science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lying to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's designed to kill the odors,
but also it makes off its own,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it smells like a urinal cake hospital
kind of a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ONA gel would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put those at your front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your back door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you've got any sort of air
conditioning, blowing air out,
[SPEAKER_01]: set the ONA gel next to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will shoot that ONA smell right out
through your air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my advice, because if you grew
good weed, uh, I ordered a pizza and the
[SPEAKER_01]: pizza guy looked at me like, holy shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I opened the door, he knew I
was trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily I went to high school with that
pizza dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've known that dude for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was not an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out pizza guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to say your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, boys and girls, I have been
rambling here for a very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.
