[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 756 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming to you on a super hot Colorado
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a great episode lined up for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to the main topic of today's
show, I should do an update from a
[SPEAKER_01]: previous episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last episode, I talked a lot about
pests and pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I was actually at the grow store
grabbing some supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that I should warn you that
one of the most common places for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: get bugs is that grow store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that comes from that grow store
may possibly be carrying spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have thrips, it could have
aphids, it could have bad shit on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, anytime you go to the dispensary,
keep in mind, a lot of growers and smokers
[SPEAKER_01]: and consumers are there, you're risking
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, anytime you go to your friend's
place that does grow, you are risking
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a friend's car that grows,
if your friend that grows comes to your
[SPEAKER_01]: place, you are also risking a spider mite
infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was at the grow store today,
I realized I failed to mention those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thought that I would throw that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remind you, there are a lot of other
options for getting bugs, not just the
[SPEAKER_01]: only places, not only the places I
mentioned, but also the grow store,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take your date to the botanical
garden, if you go out to the park,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you go on a hike, those are all
potential places for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I feel like I left that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanted to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that in here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get much further, let's do a few
shout outs to a few of those great folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who do support the show on Patreon.

[SPEAKER_01]: This episode will come out on July 3rd,
2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that we are in the middle of a
4th of July sale on the iREDirect website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, if you go to iregenetics
.com, there is a tab that says iREDirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on the iREDirect tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a sale going on where you can get
some great beans at some great prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go now, check the live inventory,
see what is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get what you can because things will sell
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sale did start on Friday at midnight
that will go until the end of the 4th of
[SPEAKER_01]: July.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the 4th of July at 11.59 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when it ends on the 5th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things go back to regular price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the good shit will be sold out by
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into this podcast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a great question that came from
the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't answer questions from
YouTube but somebody sent me this and they
[SPEAKER_01]: said this would be great for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Can you touch on stabilizing
feminized reversals on a future episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what you're asking is if I can
basically talk about making and
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilizing feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about making femme seeds
then we'll kind of jump into the
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilization part of the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does he mean by feminized reversals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminized reversals is making femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a reversed plant to make feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really briefly, I'll tell you how I do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I very carefully, and we'll touch more on
this in the part of the episode here,
[SPEAKER_01]: I very carefully select a female plant
that I will choose to make a pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A female plant will be treated with a
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make my own silver thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I treat that female plant at a
certain dilution, at certain intervals,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a very tight schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will get sprayed with that silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That female plant will then create pollen
sacs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pollen will only contain female
chromosomes because the plant that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: selected is purely female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll pass female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then take that female pollen and put
that on another female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all of the seeds that come from that
female plant that received the pollen will
[SPEAKER_01]: be female seeds because I have not
introduced any male chromosomes into the
[SPEAKER_01]: equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is making feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said feminized reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from a reversal to make the
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they want to talk about the word
they chose here is stabilizing feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where this gets fun because the
word stabilization gets kind of tossed
[SPEAKER_01]: around in the cannabis community in a lot
of weird ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stabilization doesn't only necessarily
refer to sexual stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But stabilization more refers to,
in the agricultural world, stabilization
[SPEAKER_01]: more refers to uniformity amongst
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we threw out a hundred seeds,
we shouldn't see a hundred different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should hopefully, if we've done the
stabilization the way that agriculture big
[SPEAKER_01]: ag likes it, you're going to see one maybe
two phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go look in a corn field,
if you look in a soy field, a big field
[SPEAKER_01]: that's run by commercial farmers,
all of those phenotypes, all that corn
[SPEAKER_01]: looks the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't grow clones of the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got it narrowed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's GMO corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of, they're cheating,
but they've got that corn figured out to
[SPEAKER_01]: our every seed looks the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seeds are stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I grow this corn in this part
of the country, in this location,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will get three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will begin to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take this many weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take this much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got that fucking seed dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is stabilization amongst the
agricultural environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what stabilization refers to.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times when people say stable in
cannabis, they say, that's not stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only referring to sexual
stability, meaning that some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds will show intersex traits
or also the regular seeds will show
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is oftentimes what people mean by
stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk more about
stabilizing them for the phenotype because
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, if the proper plants were
selected to make feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is where the stabilization happens
for making the sexual stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If both of the plants that you have chosen
to work with to make female seeds are true
[SPEAKER_01]: females and do not contain intersex
traits, then you can definitely make
[SPEAKER_01]: stable female plants from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all about the selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't do rigorous testing and
careful selection, then it is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to stabilize your feminized
crosses sexually if you've done the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about doing the proper work.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: To find out if a female is a true female,
you've got to give it some tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's, almost every cannabis plant
eventually, there's some way to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant show you intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some way to make that plant
produce a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But under most conditions, under a lot of
stress, most of the plants I'm working
[SPEAKER_01]: with will not show us intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will do things like put a female
plant into flower for 12 or 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as she shows me I'm a female,
I'm in flower, guess what I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it back to another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just change it to 18-6, 19-5, 24 and zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just change that timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in like 10 days, we'll put it back on
12-12 and see what that plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it freak out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it do weird shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it crinkle up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it die?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the leaves start curling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it get the claw?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it get the sunshine finger?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it show me intersex traits?
[SPEAKER_01]: I pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that to every plant that I breed
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to stress the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also give those plants to friends of
mine who I know are going to abuse these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as good of a grower as a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the people that will find out if
that plant's going to give me problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I choose to breed with anything,
if I'm making regular seeds or feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, I will stress test my plants
rigorously, very, very vigorous and
[SPEAKER_01]: rigorously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will underfeed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mess with the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give them too much heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give them too much cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those plants show me any sign of
intersex traits, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get to go in the breeding room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may breed it for myself to other plants
to keep it for myself, but it will not
[SPEAKER_01]: make it to the production line for you
guys to ever purchase, ever grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will do a test on every plant,
the pollen donor and the pollen receiver
[SPEAKER_01]: before I ever think about doing a
feminized reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the people say that fem seeds are made
from an intersex plant, that it's a you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making the plant hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that is very wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word hermaphrodite and feminized seeds
should not be in the same mix at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you breed with intersex plants,
you create more intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get stabilized feminized grasses,
I'm going backwards here, the way to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: is to start with stable female genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, you can use a feminized female
plant and a feminized female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can reverse one and pollinate the
other and make more female plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry that one's female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry that one's not female or
feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can breed with the fems just
like the regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is there was no male
chromosome involved in that breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we've kind of touched base on the
differences between sexual stability and
[SPEAKER_01]: actual phenotypical stability,
let's talk a little bit about making
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds and some of the traits I
see in these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit about the
stability, if you will, of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two different options when we're
making feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got what are known as an S1 or I
guess there are more options.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're going to start with are the
S1 and the R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other options are basically going to
be filial generations with different
[SPEAKER_01]: higher numbers at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, we're going to focus on the
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to focus on S and R.
[SPEAKER_01]: S stands for self.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say we took a golden goat
female and a another golden goat female
[SPEAKER_01]: and I reversed one golden goat and put the
pollen onto the other golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just made S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a golden goat that fucked itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never forget that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That golden goat fucked itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds that come out of that are going
to be pure golden goat feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It selfed itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the other option is an R, an R1,
a reversal of the first generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an R would be if I took that golden
goat plant and reversed it, but if I put
[SPEAKER_01]: that pollen on any other female plant,
the seeds that come from that are an R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a reversal one, a first generation
reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also an F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does qualify as an F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the cannabis space, in the
marketing, the labeling realm,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the websites of buying and selling
seeds, people like to know if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting fems or regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way to clearly indicate that is to put
that that is an R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: A first generation reversal, the first
filial generation of a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put that pollen on anything but
itself, you have now done an R.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've used reversed pollen to put on any
other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I put, this has been done,
if we put reversed golden goat on a lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk female, that does make lemon Jeffrey
R1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Jeffrey reversal filial generation
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about those two different
things now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the selfing and the reversal,
the R and the S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what I see in those and
talk about stability amongst those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I do the S1s, I see a lot of
stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a breeder that works with F1s of
regular seeds and works with F2s and F3s,
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the variations that I'm
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, in my opinion,
when I make the S1, I'm gonna say about 70
[SPEAKER_01]: to 75 percent of those phenotypes look
just like the mommy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them look a little bit different,
but sometimes also those are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those weirdos that don't look like the
mom, that brought out some great
[SPEAKER_01]: grandparent that I don't even know what it
is, sometimes those are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time when I'm working with
the S1s, I want to say 75-ish percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: those are going to look just like the
mommy, which because you've got,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all that you put in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took golden goat, you took golden
goat, you poured golden goat in a pan,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna come out looking like golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The options are that you're going to see
parents of the golden goat and great-great
[SPEAKER_01]: grandparents and grandparents of the
golden goat in that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may see old stuff pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, you're going to see the
golden goat in that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about the Rs, the
reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we took a golden goat female and
we put that pollen on a, when we put it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the lemon skunk, it makes lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lemon skunk really dominates that
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those phenotypes look a lot like
the lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably say, or the lemon skunk,
I would say 50% of them come out more
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon skunk than golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now let's talk about putting that
same reversed golden goat pollen on a
[SPEAKER_01]: female lemon skunk plant and that makes
lemon jeffery R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about that a moment ago,
the first filial generation of a reversal
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've called it lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the lemon skunk female pollinated by
the reversed golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those phenotypes come out looking
very much like the lemon skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just something that comes from that
plant, from that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that the common phenotype there
is going to look a lot like the lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk, but then it's got the golden goat
potency and the speed and the vigor of the
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat when it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon skunk has a very unique leaf
shape, a very unique growth pattern and
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a very great aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that when you breed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely see it come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the phenotypes look a lot like
that lemon skunk, but there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes that look a little bit more
golden goat and there are things that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of lean toward really lemon skunk and a
little bit more and a little bit less
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat, but a lot of it gets that
lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can identify those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that amongst that cross,
probably 60 to 70 percent of those look a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot like the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk more about the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I put that pollen on the platinum
tangy, which has been done, that makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: orange gazum.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I do that one, I see basically 50-50
amongst most of the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say 70 percent of those
phenotypes are 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the the platinum tangy orange
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat growth shape and structure
and that buzz and it smells like the
[SPEAKER_01]: oranges, it's basically 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 70 percent of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 30 percent, however,
that will get really tall and really
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The platinum tangy doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat doesn't do that, but the
island sweet skunk and the Hawaiian sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, they definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a parent of the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing grandparents come through in
some phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I said that 70 percent of them are 50
percent and 30 percent are going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see that really tall one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find one that's a little
bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's really platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to find one that gets a
real tall spear that's really golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goaty, but the stability that I see in
there is that most of those look like the
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-50 mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be very cross dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which plant dominated the mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the male win?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the female win?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they mix 50-50?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, my hopes and goals most of
the time are to get that perfect 50-50
[SPEAKER_01]: mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't guarantee that because that's just
how genetics work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon skunk when I cross to that,
it wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wins most crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dominates the mix, but whatever I put
it to really complements that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: To wrap it around and talk about
stability, what I'm seeing is when I breed
[SPEAKER_01]: with the S1s is that I'm getting 70
percent common phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I breed with the R1s, I'm probably
getting 70 percent, 50 to 75 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: common phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on the plants that I'm
breeding with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the mixture there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, some plants are going
to be more dominant in a mix and some are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be less dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their traits are going to carry through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get a couple of traits that you
really liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not get what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be scattered amongst phenotypes,
but I do see the stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel the need most of the time to
take a feminized cross past the S1 or R1
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it and it locks things in,
but then I can't breed to that because it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes things go weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made S2s of the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a back cross project of the
Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a Grateful Dog that will not
reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've feminized it so much that when I do
treat it with a strong silver thiol
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate solution, it will not reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get that one to flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you play with them too much,
you do start creating weird things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it all depends on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can create wonky shit by using too
many feminized crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can create great shit by using too
much feminized work in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can create great things by
going further generations with feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, but also sometimes some really
weird shit does come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all strains specific, plant specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: How common are the plants you were
breeding together?
[SPEAKER_01]: How uncommon are those plants that you
were breeding together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just all about the magic code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it will not.

[SPEAKER_01]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when old people fucking smoke.
