[SPEAKER_03]: So keep it locked.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grow from your heart podcast starts

[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host rusted Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode 814 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a fun show lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk later about the free seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I get too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that I would be back last week with
a fresh episode and I did not put out a
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and saw my favorite band fish in
Denver for four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I came back, my voice was raspy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My voice was harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did not want to listen to a podcast
with that voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I waited a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got quality content this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do apologize again for the delay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thank you to everybody who checked in
all of the people that said hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro, there's no podcast this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you safe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just needed some time off had to recover
the throat recover the voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back in action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for checking on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to send a big shout out to all
of the people I bumped into at the fish
[SPEAKER_02]: concerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you walked past me and gave me a high
five, a fist bump or stopped and gave me a
[SPEAKER_02]: hug, or maybe even hung out for a few
seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great to meet all of my friends at
the show that I had not met yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each and every one of you did make the
fish weekend that much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great to see and meet all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, I'm going to say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were at the fish concerts and you
saw me and you didn't come say hi,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be so shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love meeting my friends at fish
concerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come give me a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come buy me a piece of lot pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have a package of seeds in my back
pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may bust them out and give them to you
just for being at the fish show with me
[SPEAKER_02]: and making the weekend that much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to give a shout out to all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw their old friends, new friends,
people that I only see at fish concerts,
[SPEAKER_02]: people I mostly only talk to online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great to see all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was given a package of seeds by a fellow
breeder who found me on the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to try to list the people
that I saw because I will skip and forget
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody and that will make me feel bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we bumped into each other,
if we spent any time together at the fish
[SPEAKER_02]: concerts this weekend, big fist bump,
big shout out, big hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for making it an incredible
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move forward from talking
about fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about my funky voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the other thing people
have been asking about the I redirect
[SPEAKER_02]: website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I redirect has been down for approximately
a month, maybe six weeks by the time this
[SPEAKER_02]: episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are asking, where is the
website?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to do some changes and make some
adjustments to the website and to the
[SPEAKER_02]: business structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really all I can talk about right
now, but have no fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I redirect will be back and I do promise
when it comes back, I'll make a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: announcement here on the podcast and I
will also send out a newsletter on my
[SPEAKER_02]: MailChimp newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not already signed up for the
newsletter, I highly recommend you go to
[SPEAKER_02]: my website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics is still up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is still strong, still functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part on the bottom where it
says, keep in touch or stay up to date.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you type in your email address in
there, hit send, that will add you to the
[SPEAKER_02]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I send out a newsletter, you will be
included in that message and you will know
[SPEAKER_02]: when I redirect is back in action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you join the newsletter at I
read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you are shopping for seeds and
you need to get I read genetic seeds right
[SPEAKER_02]: away and you do not want to wait for I
redirect to be rebuilt, have no fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plenty of options.
[SPEAKER_02]: My other website, I read genetics.com is
still fully functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a tab that says vendors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you click on that vendor tab,
a list of seed vendors will pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those vendors are authorized and certified
vendors of I read genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of those vendors will have some
things in stock and not others.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other vendors will have some things
and not others.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got mixed and matched inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are sold out of some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some have lower and some prices on other
items.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is up to you to do the shopping and
find the packs and the pricing which you
[SPEAKER_02]: are looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are many vendors available on
the I read genetics website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply click on that vendor tab and that
will take you to all of the vendor links.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to send a big shout out to my
friends at seeds here now.com for being
[SPEAKER_02]: the vendor of the month.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: The website will be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys thank you for being patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: That leads me into the next part,
which is Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was promising Patreon contributors who
contribute $25 a month or more,
[SPEAKER_02]: a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were getting those seeds through I
redirect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was giving you a coupon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could go to I redirect and order it
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I redirect collapsed right
at the same time I started doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are owed a pack of seeds from
Patreon, please do send me a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send that message either on
Patreon or to my email at grow from your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you include your address and I
will be sure to get your free seeds out
[SPEAKER_02]: for your Patreon contribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, thank you to everybody who
does contribute to the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, that is patreon.com forward
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody who contributes $25 a month or
more in the month of where are we
[SPEAKER_02]: September?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, everybody who contributes that much
25 or more in the month of September will
[SPEAKER_02]: receive a free 10 pack of Whitechapel
premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the regular seeds that would be
sold on the website, the same seeds you
[SPEAKER_02]: would get from a vendor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a 10 pack in the premium packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is quality premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting a regular inventory pack of
Whitechapel for your $25 contribution to
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big thank you to everybody who
contributes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, if you have not gotten
your package or a tracking number,
[SPEAKER_02]: please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me a message on Patreon or send me a
message via email at grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_02]: at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, since I'm talking about seeds that I
may owe to people, if you still have not
[SPEAKER_02]: received your seeds that you have won as
prizes on this show, please do send me an
[SPEAKER_02]: email with the word seeds in the subject
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Include your address and the episode
number which you won your seeds on and I
[SPEAKER_02]: will promptly get those seeds out to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, now that gives me a perfect segue
into my next update.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like I owe you a pack of seeds
because I read your message here on the
[SPEAKER_02]: show and promised you a free pack of seeds
as a prize.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you still have not received those
prizes, please send me an email in that
[SPEAKER_02]: email in the subject line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put prizes and please do include your
shipping address with a real name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And along with that, please do include the
episode number in which you won those
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to go make sure that I'm
sending seeds to the correct people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the emails printed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to go make sure you're
giving me the right name, the right email
[SPEAKER_02]: address.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'll get those seeds shipped out to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that some people have been
skipped and some people are probably
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering where their seeds are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I had a better method of keeping
track of those expectations on those
[SPEAKER_02]: packages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promised and I realized recently I
skipped a few and I have failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking full accountability for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to correct it and I will get
those packages out as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do realize now that the plan,
the method that I had for getting those
[SPEAKER_02]: out simply wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was missing messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, please send me an email with
your name, your shipping address,
[SPEAKER_02]: the episode that you won.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, when you send me a
shipping address, please put a real name
[SPEAKER_02]: on your shipping address.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be your real name,
but I don't want to send seeds to a ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob 5,000 or bong ripper 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you got the word bong, or ganja,
or plants, or weed, or the number 420 in
[SPEAKER_02]: your name, please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very suspicious to the post
office.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know your name is not ganja Bob 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that does is make them wonder what
ganja Bob 420 is getting mailed to them
[SPEAKER_02]: and what the white guy with dreadlocks
sent to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So help us help each other out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you send me your address,
please send me a real name or at least a
[SPEAKER_02]: name that doesn't look suspicious so we
can get your package to you safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I think we covered all of the
news and the updates here at the start of
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some new cannabis
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite often I get an email asking a very
similar line of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are confused about something and I
want to clear it up here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: On many seed vending, seed selling
websites, you will see that we state that
[SPEAKER_02]: our seeds do not contain THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis seeds, or hemp seeds if you will,
or any seeds for that matter, do not
[SPEAKER_02]: contain any THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason that we list that on the
websites is because that is why it is
[SPEAKER_02]: legal to ship seeds to you through the
mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: If those seeds contained cannabinoids,
if there was any testable detectable THC
[SPEAKER_02]: within those seeds, we would not be
allowed to sell and or ship those seeds to
[SPEAKER_02]: our customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason the website says that the
seed itself does not contain any THC is
[SPEAKER_02]: because the seed itself does not contain
any THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There seems to be some confusion because
the outcome that comes from those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: should, may, and will be vastly different
than what the seed actually contains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are able to send you the seed
because it does not contain any illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get that seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, depending on where you live,
the laws and regulations in your location,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the amount of dedication you want to
put into this project, if you choose to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow those plants, that is up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then maybe they will produce detectable
traceable cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the seeds you are buying do not contain
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got less than 0.3% THC,
which makes them able to be sold online
[SPEAKER_02]: and shipped to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you receive those seeds, it is up to
you what you do with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people keep them as a souvenir,
as a novelty collectible, as a
[SPEAKER_02]: preservation kit is what they call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the seeds we are sending you do not
contain THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they took all of the seeds you bought
and put them in a grinder and ground them
[SPEAKER_02]: up and ran them through a test,
they will not find any THC, which makes
[SPEAKER_02]: them legal for us to sell and ship to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get the seeds, that is your
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds are sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in an illegal location where you
should not grow, those seeds are sold to
[SPEAKER_02]: you as a souvenir, as a novelty,
as a collector item, or as a genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: preservation kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If cannabis does become legal in your area
at some point, or if you relocate to a
[SPEAKER_02]: place where those seeds are legal,
then at that point, you can grow them out
[SPEAKER_02]: and make the adult legal decision to
cultivate those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, that is when the
cannabinoids will come into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow that plant correctly,
you should reach the potential of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids available in that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we are sending you will not
contain any THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see that on the website,
and it says these seeds contain 0% THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not saying it's going to grow
something that will not contain THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're saying what we are sending you has
no THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you to make that THC happen or
do not make it happen if you are in an
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal location.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that can be confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one part of the website, it'll say 0%
THC, and then at another part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: website, potentially 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, it looks like a contradiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you realize we're talking about the
seed itself is THC free, you've got to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the work and create the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, if you are in a legal
location.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, podcast world, I feel like I've
caught up on the business part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it is time to segue into everybody's
favorite portion of the grow from your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That of course is the grow help question
part of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a bunch of great questions here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: These questions come from my website at
irea.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to my website, there's a list of
tabs at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them does say questions or grow
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you click on that tab, you will be sent
to a little form.
[SPEAKER_02]: That form has a few basic questions like
are you growing indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the website and you fill out
that grow help tab and you send me a
[SPEAKER_02]: question and I read your question here on
the podcast, that means you win a free
[SPEAKER_02]: pack of I read genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question on today's episode
came from my new friend Michael Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael, please do send me your shipping
address because I owe you a free pack of I
[SPEAKER_02]: read genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael's grow question goes just like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Hey Rasta, Jeff, how do we know
that the seeds we buy from you,
[SPEAKER_02]: that the parents do not have hop,
latent viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: A very hot topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a very good answer before I give
you the solid, short, concise answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ramble a little bit and talk about
hop, latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people may not know what this virus
or this viroid is recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: This virus has been plaguing grows all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently I discovered that a friend with a
commercial cultivation in New Mexico
[SPEAKER_02]: tested positive for this virus,
so it has moved into New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means it is probably all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers like to send clones all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We share clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We trade clones, so this is going to
become a very dangerous problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clones are going to get all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: This disease is going to be spread very
quickly, so this is a virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This virus makes our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like they're healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like they're fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when you put him into flower,
they kind of dud out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't make big buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't make big flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they show other symptoms,
but the main sign of the hop, latent
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid is that your plant that used to put
out three pounds per light now barely puts
[SPEAKER_02]: out one pound per light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't grow worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always going to look sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to look droopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to look frustrated and you
can't figure out why.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you need to test that plant for
hop, latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a virus that came from the hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It transferred to the ganja plants and
knew we are spreading it all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: This virus can be spread by plant saps and
plant tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're cutting clones or doing
defoliation or just topping plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you cut a plant, you cut the plant
with the scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The juice from that plant, the inside of
that plant is now on your scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to cut another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what you just did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just transferred that virus from one
plant to the other that quickly,
[SPEAKER_02]: that easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another way that the virus transfers very
easily and very quickly is through water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The virus can survive in water for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what will happen is we're going to cut
a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put it in the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to cut another clone,
put it in the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That water is going to stir around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every cut in your easy cloner is now
contaminated with hop, latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this virus is very easy to spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main problem is that this virus is
also nearly impossible to eradicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way that we know of to get rid of
this virus so far is through tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only know one person who has
successfully removed the virus from their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants through tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with all of that fear and hype being
said, it is completely understandable that
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are purchasing seeds should be
very concerned that the seeds they are
[SPEAKER_02]: purchasing do not come from parent plants
that contain hop, latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing a little bit of reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some scientists do say that the virus will
transfer into the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say it will be in some of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people will say it will be in a lot
of the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say it will not pass to the
seed at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not have the credentials to have an
opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't have the education,
the schooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no business even having an opinion
on if that virus will pass to the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do know is that I do not have any
plants in my grow that contain hop,
[SPEAKER_02]: latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I be sure of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there are multiple labs across our
country that do test our plants for hop,
[SPEAKER_02]: latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way anybody can be sure that
their plants do not have hop, latent
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid is to have them tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have had every plant in my garden
tested by two of the major leading hop,
[SPEAKER_02]: latent viroid testing facilities in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, they're the two most
popular and two most reliable testing
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every plant in my garden has been tested
for hop, latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every clone that comes in now is tested
for hop, latent viroid before it is
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to enter the general population.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a little area set up,
a little quarantine area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you give me a clone, sell me a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I find a clone, if it falls out of the
sky, that clone lands in my quarantine
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately, I've got backup tests on
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have had one here at the table,
but they're in my grow space, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I order a test from,
I actually have been using Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmer Freeman does not pay me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not sponsor me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy my testing kits just like a
civilian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I order them online.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I order extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always got a couple on hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime I get a new plant, that plant goes
directly into my quarantine area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little tiny area with a very
small light, but it's a little isolation
[SPEAKER_02]: booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can find out if that plant's got
problems before I put it into general
[SPEAKER_02]: population and infect my entire garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started doing this watching for bugs,
but now we're also watching for viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant comes in and immediately I
grab a testing kit off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a few extras on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grab one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I label it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I date it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are three envelopes in the testing
kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open up an envelope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put a leaf in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open up all three envelopes,
get a leaf from different parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are different ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: The virus will move through different
parts of the plant at different speeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could test one branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not have any virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You test another branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be fully loaded with viral load.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I send in a small piece of root
sample, about a two to three inch,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little piece of roots off of each plant
that gets tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets sent in with the leaf material.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand and what I have
read, many times you will get a negative
[SPEAKER_02]: test on a leaf sample, but the virus will
be present in the roots as the main way to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine if that plant's got the virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do choose to test, make sure you
are doing a root sample test when looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for HLV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically that is the short and long
answer of how I can assure you that none
[SPEAKER_02]: of the seeds you are purchasing from me
will contain hoplite and viroid because I
[SPEAKER_02]: have lab tests for every plant in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I get a new clone and I decide to
test this clone right here, and I've got
[SPEAKER_02]: two or three tests sitting around,
I'll test that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since I've got to pay for shipping,
I'll grab another plant randomly in the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow and grab leaves off of that and do a
test on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there is a procedure to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use the same gloves, don't use the
same scalpel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is cleaned between testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm getting at is if I'm sending
one test, I just also send another test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like looking around the grow room,
seeing who gets the UA today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, if I'm testing this,
new plant, why not grab another plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: the garden and just give it a random test
so that we can just randomly test plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and make sure that everything is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm testing a new plant,
I'll look in the bedroom or the mom room
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll go that one today and I'll change
gloves and I'll clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a procedure to be done,
but I will test another plant at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to pay for shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to send them off to Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not give him two plants to test
instead of just one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit of redundancy in the
testing to make sure there is no virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be responsible and make sure
that I am not spreading a virus to any of
[SPEAKER_02]: the people buying my seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is how I am making sure to be
extra careful to not spread any viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am having my plants tested as soon as
they come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also randomly test everything
every few weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything will get tested within six to
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every plant will have a test every six to
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do everything all at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's expensive and it seems like a lot
of tests to go pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just do a couple every week or whenever
a new clone comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way I can just kind of stay in the
rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure that everything is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I can assure you that none
of the seeds you're going to receive from
[SPEAKER_02]: me have viruses because I am doing my due
diligence and I am testing every single
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that comes into my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I recently sprouted a bunch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how much I've talked about
that here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sprouted a bunch of seeds that I bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sprouted a bunch of seeds from other
breeders and friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all look great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look magnificent.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they get a little bit bigger,
I'm going to also randomly test a few of
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants that came from seed just
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be testing a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be testing a bunch of seeds
for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in the future, there will be a
test to actually test a batch of seeds for
[SPEAKER_02]: the presence of virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with that is the seeds have to
be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way we would do it is if you bred,
let's just say you bred a thousand seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd take 20 or 30% of them and actually
donate those for testing purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if that virus shows up in any of
those, we've got to test a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that it's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't see it, then we're going to
have faith that if it's not in 20 to 30%
[SPEAKER_02]: of the seeds, it should not be present.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tests have come from both parents and
the seeds eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is almost triple redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, my friends, is how you can rest
assured that you will not get any viruses
[SPEAKER_02]: from my seed line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my new friend, Michael, we are testing
everything for Hop, Latent, Viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the future, we will also be testing
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, my friend, is how you can rest
assured that none of the seeds you buy
[SPEAKER_02]: from me will contain Hop, Latent,
Viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, my buddy, Michael, once again,
please do send me your address and I will
[SPEAKER_02]: get you a pack of iREADY.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics premium seeds in the mail as soon
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I've got another great question
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one also came from the Grow Help tab
on the iREADY Genetics website.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called Mr. Awesome Badass.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Mr. Awesome Badass?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably will not call you that if we do
hang out in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to adjust that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question, however, goes a lot like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, Yo, Rasta Jeff, I found you after
your appearance over at Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, big shout out to my friends at
Cannabuzz for having a great social media
[SPEAKER_02]: platform and for doing amazing interviews
every single week.
[SPEAKER_02]: One week they even did two interviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are killing it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to all of my friends who are on
Cannabuzz and the folks that run
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me keep moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I've recently gotten into growing
Cannabonzi as a hobby, and I'm now on the
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt for a strain that works well with
this type of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yield and turps are not necessarily the
goal with creating these works of art.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me talk about Cannabonzi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys seen, most of the time a
ganja plant will grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll kind of branch out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen the guys that are shaping it
the exact way that they want?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing bonzai technique to their
ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not productive, but if you want to
have a nice project and a nice hobby and
[SPEAKER_02]: have some good smoke for yourself at the
end, this is a beautiful hobby,
[SPEAKER_02]: a very zen experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is what a Cannabonzi is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically shaping the plant,
manipulating the plant through pruning,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe through tying it back, through
pulling it down and holding it down
[SPEAKER_02]: certain ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are bonzaiing their ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, yield and turps are not
necessarily the goal in creating these
[SPEAKER_02]: works of art.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, my question is, have you come
across a strain that not only can handle
[SPEAKER_02]: tiny pots, but also can handle crazy
training that these bonzai girls will go
[SPEAKER_02]: through?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that stays pliable longer than
most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I understand exactly what you're
asking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: As some plants age, they do get woody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start off really green, really
pliable, really flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they get older, they get more
brown, I guess is the way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get drier, they get snappier,
and they don't bend as easily as they did
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a trait of some plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do have some recommendations that
will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well for your bonsai idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one I want to recommend,
it may be kind of hard to find because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was mainly given away as a freebie,
but the Tangi Ripper will do amazingly
[SPEAKER_02]: with this technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one that would work very well for
you is the Sunkiss that also has that
[SPEAKER_02]: Platinum Tangi female in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tangi Ripper, the Platinum on the
Sunkiss have the same mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm going to recommend Orangegasm
for this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you spread that Orangegasm out and
shape it into the bonsai and then put it
[SPEAKER_02]: into flower, you're going to get giant
bonsai buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to stay nice and pliable for
you so you can work with it and it won't
[SPEAKER_02]: go too crazy in that small pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think all of the things that derive
from the Platinum Tangi will work very
[SPEAKER_02]: well for this idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also recommend Bubblegoat for this
project and Bubblegoat is readily
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bubblegoat and the Orangegasm are both
readily available at many seed vendors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have no problem getting those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Orangegasm, the Bubblegoat,
what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunkiss and the Tangi Ripper are the
strains I would definitely recommend for
[SPEAKER_02]: your bonsai project.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Mr. Awesome Badass, he wraps it
up with, thanks for what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey my friend, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I was able to guide you into the
right direction for bonsaiing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also for you folks out there that use
a trellis or like to manipulate the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot, all of those strains will work
great for the trellis and manipulation as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the Platinum Tangi crosses and most
of the Golden Goat crosses are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: handle bending, popping, twisting,
snapping, and manipulation like this very
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend, Mr. Awesome Badass,
once again, thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, please do send me your address
with a real name so I can send you a free
[SPEAKER_02]: pack of Iri Genetics Premium Seeds.
