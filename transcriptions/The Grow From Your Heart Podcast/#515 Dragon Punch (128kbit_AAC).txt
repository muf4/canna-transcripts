[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can tell that I'm still
trying to catch my breath from the
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic dabs of Sour Diesel BX2 full
spectrum extract that I just took.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really enjoying the Sour Diesel BX2
full spectrum extract diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This jar was ridiculous with big chunky
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the cross here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the label, this is a blend of Sour
Diesel and Sour Diesel cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: Headbanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a BX, which means they were
trying to recreate the Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a BX2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a Sour Diesel male available,
so they had to introduce the Headbanger
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bred the Headbanger male to the Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you find the appropriate male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you breed that back to the Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a whole other podcast episode,
which I think I have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package of this Sour Diesel BX2,
it is described as floral, sweet and pine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I find to be completely accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, I do not enjoy the flavor
of Sour Diesel concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that Sour Diesel diesel
funky gas aroma translates well when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to diamonds and sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is just missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it comes out properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skunk part goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns into weird, harsh chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, with the Green Dot Labs Sour
Diesel BX2, most of that weird chemically
[SPEAKER_00]: funkiness is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit it, when you open the jar,
you immediately smell, I immediately smell
[SPEAKER_00]: the floral aroma, which they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the dabber hits the dab and
starts going into your face, it gets that
[SPEAKER_00]: floral, sweet thing happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, that is where the pine
kind of coats my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves the room like floral and piney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a pine air freshener with a
little bit of perfume to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's delicious, and I obviously am
loving the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says the
product contains 75.27% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious Sour Diesel BX2
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, in this episode,
I'm going to talk about one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that I have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to review the strain called
Dragon Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of the folks who support the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be

[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's talk about one
of my favorite strains that I find is
[SPEAKER_00]: often overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I haven't talked about this one
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I haven't posted enough photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you guys just haven't discovered the
magic of a strain that I call Dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last strain review, I did a strain
called Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do one called Dragon Punch so you
guys can kind of see where I get my naming
[SPEAKER_00]: schemes and my themes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am a 90s kid, an 80s kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love video games.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cartoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where my naming schemes come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done Sonic Boom last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do Dragon Punch this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Dragon Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragon Punch is a cross of East Coast
Panama Chunk Cross 2 TK Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant did not have an official name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered that another breeder is
already using that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a very popular line with that
name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have stopped referring to that name
altogether when it comes to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is now known as East Coast Panama
Chunk Cross 2 TK Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the genetics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an awesome plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast Panama Chunk creates giant,
giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are monstrous and they have this
chocolatey, funky, earthy aroma to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the TK Stardog is gassy and funky and
has a really nice, feely funk to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: grows really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a beautiful hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant created gigantic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant created gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant created beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would create purples and magentas and
pinks and reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you let it flower long enough,
the buds would get this really dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants were super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was East Coast Panama Chunk Cross 2
TK Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took my prized Arise male,
who is known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if you listen to this podcast,
you've heard me talk about King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon is a very select Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a Golden Goat to Daybreaker
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat has that tropical,
sweet, sativa dominant characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got real thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes really tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grows in about nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a very beautiful plant to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated that with a Daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is an indica dominant hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cross of Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got that Chem D, rotten funk,
that fresh tennis ball, burnt rubber kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross to the Joseph OG, which is really
funky, really feely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of a feet aroma to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you cross the Golden Goat and the
Daybreaker, you get a sweet, tropical,
[SPEAKER_00]: funky, nasty sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arise seems to grow with hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant grows really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that male that I selected passes on
that hyper vigor trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of his offspring grow really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow really rapidly with a lot of
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can veg them for about a week less
than many other plants in many situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also discovered that most of the
things I pollinate with King Solomon
[SPEAKER_00]: become very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of his progeny are highly potent in
lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen many of his offspring test in
the high 20s and several of them test in
[SPEAKER_00]: the low 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an Arise female that tests at
35.84% THCA at Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my favorite plants to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows the potential of that male
plant, which I have selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have crossed that male Arise plant to
the female East Coast Panama chunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was crossed to the TK Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to write down the name of
that plant, I would put a parenthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would write ECPC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's East Coast Panama chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would put an X and that is crossed
to TKSD, which is TK Stardog, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: infamous triangle cush crossed to the
Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in parentheses, you would have ECPC and
then a space and then an X and then TKSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would close your parentheses
up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would write another X and then
you would write Arise because the female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was the East Coast Panama chunk
crossed to TK Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all one cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put an X.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male that I introduced into that
collaboration there was the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now knowing that pedigree, knowing that
all star lineup of genetics, we know what
[SPEAKER_00]: to expect a little bit from this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got East Coast Panama chunk,
which is known for making gigantic buds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are kind of chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have sort of a hashy sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got the TK Stardog,
which is known for that skunky funky aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: and that vigorous growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got Arise, which comes from
Chem D and Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got more potential for even more
dirty funky aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got that Golden Goat in there
to kind of give it that sativa edge so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get that super head ripping high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really interesting and a really
fun hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I grew it out, I got mostly what
I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about some of the phenotypes
here a little bit later in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the flavors and aromas
that come from the Dragon Punch plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite aromas that come from this
plant are sort of a chocolatey,
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy, sort of a coppery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of a coffee, sort of a burnt rubber
sort of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really funky and I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of dark chocolatey, kind of
hashy, and it's got a little bit of a hint
[SPEAKER_00]: of armpits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound completely disgusting,
but when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of those words are the best
things you can hear in a strained
[SPEAKER_00]: description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got funky, it's got chocolate,
it's got armpits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of really unique aromas
and flavors that come from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sort of like you took dark chocolate
and maybe some coffee and then put a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of jet fuel inside of that cup
and it is deliciously funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying funky because there's just a
weird funk to the Dragon Punch and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that that East Coast
Panama chunk put a really nice chocolatey,
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy sort of a flavor and aroma into
this cross because I've also crossed the
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise to the Stardog and I don't get any
of that coffee flavor from that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one goes more gas and berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put the East Coast Panama chunk
in there, it really gave it like an earthy
[SPEAKER_00]: savory sort of a tone, sort of a,
I keep saying chocolate, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the best description I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate, real dark chocolate,
sort of earthy, burnt coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that aroma in the back end
of my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolatey, funky, earthy, hashy,
a hint of feet and maybe hints of fuel in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it like when you smoke Dragon
Punch?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a reason why I called it Dragon
Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sort of like getting punched right
in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit Dragon Punch a couple of
times, you kind of just want to chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like your body is super stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your body just sucks into the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, I might be stuck here for a
minute, but also your brain starts going
[SPEAKER_00]: so fast that you really wish you could get
up and do some shit, but you're just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, I'm probably just going to sit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a guitar in your hand or if
you've got a PlayStation or an Xbox
[SPEAKER_00]: controller in your hand, you're probably
in the fucking zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a songwriter, if you're an
artist, if you're a musician, or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, this is the perfect kind of
herb that I'm a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all kinds of random creativity sort
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of stuff that when I
smoke it, I just want to sit here and be
[SPEAKER_00]: creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be around other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need any other sort of inputs or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to entertain myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: My creativity just starts going crazy when
I smoke the Dragon Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes my body just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to sit here and chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my brain is like, okay, let's do all
of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really nice, creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herb for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works great to play the guitar,
maybe play some video games, maybe write
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff down for a podcast and get a
creative flow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really good herb for my
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also find that it's super good for lower
back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a six foot five guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to complain too much about my
body aches and pains because we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got aches and pains and all that
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes my lower back fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I got to do is take a dab of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragon Punch and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No more lower back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it just go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I almost forgot to
mention, I noticed that when I smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragon Punch, if I smoke it before bedtime
to ease that back pain, to kind of chill
[SPEAKER_00]: myself out, I have amazing dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already have pretty intense dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of control my dreams a little
bit, but I feel when I smoke that Dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: Punch, I've got a lot more control of my
dreams and they are very intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I try to play around too
much in my dreams, like if I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something and I realize, oh, bro,
you're dreaming and you've got control of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, sometimes I can like manipulate the
dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I do too much, I'll wake myself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when I smoke Dragon Punch,
I can really dance around in that dream
[SPEAKER_00]: realm and I don't wake myself up as easily
and snap myself out of whatever crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: situation I've gotten myself into in
dreamland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives me incredible dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to relieve the pain and it just
makes me super creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal when I bred this plant was to get
some of that chocolate flavor and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those purple and magenta colors into that
Arise cross, but also bring that Arise
[SPEAKER_00]: potency into the cross, bring that Arise
vigor into the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The East Coast Panama Chunk TK Stardog
plant was already a crazy vigorous grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes it didn't make the biggest
chunkiest buds if the room was not
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a finicky, picky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that King Solomon puts crazy vigor
into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it puts crazy potency into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my idea was to cross the King Solomon
to the East Coast Panama Chunk TK Stardog
[SPEAKER_00]: cross to kind of increase the vigor and
fix that finickiness that plant originally
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would grow the shit out of most of the
plants in the grow and this one would be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah, I'm cool, but I could have
done better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew there was more potential in
that plant, but in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you cannot adjust the entire
room for one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If seven out of 10 plants are thriving and
three of them are kind of going,
[SPEAKER_00]: eh, you leave it just like it is so that
70% of your room is killing it and you
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust and don't run those three next
time, you run those in a different room
[SPEAKER_00]: and fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew I could fix it, so I bred it to
the arise and it came out very close to
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I see from this cross that
I was really not hoping for, I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hope didn't happen, is some of the plants
are extremely tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very, very tall phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phenotype that I call the tall
stretchy girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you're growing a fucking
fishing pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make one giant six foot tall cola
right up the middle and it doesn't give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a lot of side branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really cool fucking trait that is
also a serious pain in the ass trait for a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in an indoor tent and
you've got three or four of these in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room and you're thinking you're going to
get some five foot tall plants with some
[SPEAKER_00]: branching, maybe not because sometimes
this one phenotype just doesn't make much
[SPEAKER_00]: branching and it shoots one six foot tall
cola right out of the middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a tent, you're fucking
screwed because those tents are only six
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall, maybe seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're touching the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do some manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the downside to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, that is only one phenotype
and also outdoors in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, that plant would be fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an honest and open breeder who likes
to have a very open conversation with my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and the people who buy my seeds
and my supporters, I'm going to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a phenotype in this pack of seeds
that is a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets way too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing outdoors or in a
tall greenhouse, that thing could be
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking the super cash cropper for you
because there's not much trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes giant family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make a lot of little sugar
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just clip off those giant fan
leaves and you've got six foot long
[SPEAKER_00]: baseball bat colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look super good on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are really good advertising for you
and for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work beautifully if that's what
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a phenotype that starts
getting really tall on you really quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people assume that one's going to be
a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've assumed that when most plants take
off, I go, that's going to be my boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just start paying attention and I
know he's probably the first to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the fishing pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype that gets really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a reliable breeder who tries to be
honest and open, I'm going to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that one may be problematic for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honest, I did not predict,
foresee, anticipate or expect that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which plants make that happen
in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming it's something in the East
Coast Panama chunk because I've played
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of the other plants before in
different combinations and I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an East Coast Panama chunk
trait that is made by a plant that's about
as tall as six feet in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been making just one six foot tall
giant donkey dick baseball bat bud in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get that one, send me pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works for you or if it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just got to admit that it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I didn't know that was
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a big surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a very neat surprise to go,
what's with this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not making much branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just made the plant was like three feet
tall and it had like four or five little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny side branches off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took two of them off to make
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that fucker took off six feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm off on a rant on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the downside to this cross is you will
get tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upside to this cross is for outdoor
growing, you may get some gigantic fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be very colorful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these phenotypes produce really
dark green leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find really beautiful fall colors
toward the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen reds and pinks and magentas and
oranges and golds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves look like flames and fire with
purple on the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants make gorgeous, gorgeous
colors at the end of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I have noticed that if you lower the
pH and also get it kind of cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see a lot of beautiful,
beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about feeding
dragon punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragon punch makes giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragon punch is a fast growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragon punch is going to eat a lot of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will also like an excessive amount of
Kalamag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that some of the broader
leafed phenotypes like a lot of Kalamag.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also prefers lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get the pH a little bit lower
than most plants, I feel like the dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: punch will appreciate life a little bit
better and she will also make those
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is very resistant to all temperature
swings from what I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does well in hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does well in cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll do wonderfully in a dialed in
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also responds very well to kelp
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some kelp products,
something like liquid karma or something
[SPEAKER_00]: in that realm will bring out that stank
and that flavor and aroma also helps bring
[SPEAKER_00]: out those beautiful fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally recommend that you lollipop
and pop and twist and trellis all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that I breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that sometimes the dragon
punch does not respond well to popping and
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes will create really
purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants do not like to be twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not like the popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is genetic because I've seen it
in several phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is a genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those purple stems do not want to be
popped and twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're brittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this plant does not react well
to trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: That finicky, woody type of stem sometimes
makes them want to break when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to trellis it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed if you feed them well in
veg and you keep them young and lush,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't get as woody and you can
manipulate and bend and twist them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put them into flower and they
start freaking out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: making that transition, they will get a
little bit stiff and woody on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little bit stubborn for bending
and manipulating at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get all of your training,
all of your popping, all of your twisting,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your trellising down before all of
the plants get into that flowering phase
[SPEAKER_00]: and begin to get woody, the plants will be
happy and they will continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will notice that later in flower,
those plants will start to get purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll start to get woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't treat them too roughly because some
of those phenotypes will get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this plant is one of my more
challenging plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not be the best plant for
beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of an experienced grower
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the easiest to grow because of
that non-flexible bending and working type
[SPEAKER_00]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also takes nine to 10 weeks to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my other stuff is done by nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's going to take that extra week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend nine or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes will want 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I mentioned, earlier,
we're going to get gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're going to see four to six
foot long colas off of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is kind of a pain in the ass for a
new grower to manage that monstrous of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend an experienced grower to grow
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that it takes a little bit of
extra work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need more supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to pay more
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little bit longer,
which gives you more opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a beginner plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like anything that requires hard work,
the rewards are very worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those phenotypes that are more challenging
to grow, those phenotypes which take
[SPEAKER_00]: longer to flower are usually, generally,
more extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that 11-weeker, when you
smoke that thing, you are going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes are going to go, what the fuck
just happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to sit down in the chair and
wonder if you're melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then your brain is going to fly to the
moon and back without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get those 11-week phenotypes,
the high will rip your head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's kind of talk about some of
the phenotypes which I have hinted at.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the beautiful East Coast Panama
Chunk to TK Stardog dominant phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that beautiful bright green color
that comes from the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got those bright orange pistols that
comes from the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just smells funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got kind of a little bit of
a fluffy look to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't as tight as some of the other
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the fluffier phenotype,
that is probably coming from the East
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast Panama Chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the 50-50 phenotype,
which looks just like the TK Stardog,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of Golden Goat
resemblance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a sweet smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a chocolatey smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a dirty funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got nice tight buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one makes decent amounts of
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not real ridiculous like the East
Coast Panama Chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I often see basically an Arise
phenotype come out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like Arise number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very simply, smells very simply,
just like Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the one that I call the
leggy girl or the tall girl or the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just takes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you can see it in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates one long skinny branch with
just a few side branches coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it'll make really long side
branches that come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you chop those off, that'll just make
one giant fucking cola grow up,
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype, I talked about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you've got that one and
you're in an indoor environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: flower early and see what you've got,
you may have something fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another phenotype which scared
some of my test growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all thought that they had a problem
they could not identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a phenotype which will make very
droopy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, that Daybreaker makes
gigantic leaves and no matter how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it, that bitch does not want to lift
those leaves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just stay a little bit droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's not dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers would say it needs water,
but you water the plant and it doesn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are so big, but I think the
plant just can't even support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, no, you're going three
quarters of the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you get out of me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a Daybreaker trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any problem with those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got giant leaves that are kind
of dark green, getting a little bit purple
[SPEAKER_00]: up the middle of them, that is a
Daybreaker trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are drooping, that is a trait from
the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is going to be very indica
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, that one makes you want to
sit on your ass all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that one gives me dragon red
eyes also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make your eyes super red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is mostly dominated by the
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one is honestly mostly
dominated by the Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have some of that East Coast
Panama chunk because it gets that funky
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate flavor and aroma to it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is one more phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've listed a bunch of phenotypes,
but I've got to be honest with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is variation in this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a phenotype that makes taco
leaves that is very Golden Goat dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat will get pissed off and make
taco leaves late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see some big chunky buds that
are a little bit foxtail-y that start
[SPEAKER_00]: making a little bit of taco leaf,
maybe you get some pointy tips on the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit thinner leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one that I call the taco leaf
phenotype that is very Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing a lot of Golden Goat traits
from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still a wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will finish beautifully, but it is
going to taco almost no matter what you
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are going to, we call it taco
leaf or canoeing, but they also frost up
[SPEAKER_00]: and get covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like shit, but it is super
potent bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those phenotypes, like I've said
before, are going to finish in about nine
[SPEAKER_00]: to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find outliers that will take 11
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also outliers that will take a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in the right location,
many of these phenotypes will be amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get huge harvests if you take
care of these plants properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a greenhouse, you should have
a good outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you manage the plants properly,
this plant will work very well indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are good at managing your height
and if you know what to expect,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to find the appropriate
phenotype for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid because I've talked about
all of these large tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run Dragon Punch from seed in a five by
five grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my test area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am able to get beautiful crops from
that plant in a five by five grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand how to manipulate
the plants and keep them short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be intimidated by tall, long
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a fun experiment for some of you
really experienced growers who've just
[SPEAKER_00]: been focused on eight or nine week
strains.
