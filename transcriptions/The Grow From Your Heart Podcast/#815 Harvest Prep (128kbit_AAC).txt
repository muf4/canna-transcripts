[SPEAKER_02]: The Grow From Your Heart Podcast starts
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, Podcast World, welcome to episode
815 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
preparing for our outdoor harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we do that, I want to give a big
shout out to my friends at Attitude Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out the Attitude Seed
Bank USA for a fresh drop of iReGenetics
[SPEAKER_00]: premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, now let's talk about preparing
for our outdoor harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have been working all summer
long, most of the fall, on their outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens and it is quickly approaching
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very critical part of the
growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people overlook the preparations and
expectations and needs of harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a little quick talk here and
get everybody prepared to harvest their
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, now when it comes to harvesting
our outdoor plants, the first thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: would think about is where are we going to
put this harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a safe, secure location to put all
of our plants when we chop them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just stack them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just pile them up in a corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have that area prepared?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something in mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start cleaning that room out now because
life gets chaotic around harvest time and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find yourself overwhelmed
and overloaded and the last thing you want
[SPEAKER_00]: is to be scrambling for a dry and cure
space while you're chopping down the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have a little bit of time before
harvest time comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start thinking about this stuff now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point we've got time to start
looking for the tools and supplies and
[SPEAKER_00]: space which is needed for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even you need a few friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that later on,
but let's start preparing now before these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, let's set
ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have spent weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have been outside vegging for
a couple of few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even vegged indoors for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do big plants, you vegged them
indoors, you vegged them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flowered for eight to ten weeks
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took major care of them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were out there watering them,
defoliating, keeping the bugs off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at the harvest time, this is where we
could really screw up all of the love and
[SPEAKER_00]: care that we put into these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we need is that dry and
cure space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have somewhere that when you cut
down the plants, do you have somewhere you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hang these plants safely?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a room that I prefer a dark room
if there's a little bit of light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is okay, but I definitely prefer a
dark room for hanging the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a room that is secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this room that you're thinking about
secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it non-accessible to children is the
main important thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second thing is, is it accessible
to thieves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do people know your ganja is in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it locked up safe and secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have cameras?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have maybe a little alarm system in
case somebody gets in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely have a safe and secure
place for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need the kids getting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need thieves getting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely don't want animals to get in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's your own domestic pets,
if it's wild animals outside, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna love the smell of that ganja and
they may try to get to it and they may try
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of animals love the smell of
cannabis, rats, bunnies, anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get to your plants if it's
available and they will try to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need plenty of space, a secure
place with little light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need some airflow in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting some airflow in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: A room that, let me back up and this isn't
even on my notes, this just came to my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind because this is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a room that doesn't have a funky,
stanky, musty aroma because if you hang
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants in a funky, stanky room,
instead of getting good ganja smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, they are going to absorb that funky,
musty basement aroma into the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that when you are,
now that we are preparing a dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: space, maybe we can clean out a room and
open up some windows and get some air in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and get that old basement funk smell
out of there or that old barn smell or
[SPEAKER_00]: that old work shed smell, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's freshen it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some airflow happening now so we
can freshen up the air in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of some of that old, nasty,
stale aroma, whatever it may be because
[SPEAKER_00]: that will end up into your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of your buds smelling like
Grateful Dog or Morning Dew or Strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Starburst, they are going to smell like
grandma's basement and nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the smell, the aroma that
is already existing in your anticipated
[SPEAKER_00]: dry space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next thing I wanted to talk about
was airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start cleaning that funky air out
now if we get some airflow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want airflow in the dry
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a couple of fans in there,
one up higher, one down lower,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even one on the ground, stirring the
ground air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the wind blowing directly on
the plants, drying them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the wind moving it around so that
we don't get any micro climates,
[SPEAKER_00]: any hot pockets, any wet pockets in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just move and stir all of that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got some sort of an
exhaust fan in that room to vent out that
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity out of the top corner,
out of the top middle of that room,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe consider a carbon filter in
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got neighbors, thieves,
something like that may smell your ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: crop as you're drying it in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're exhausting that nice ganja scented
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a carbon filter on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is maybe a
dehumidifier in your dry and cure space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I've got plants hanging in a
commercial room, I honestly put a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifier in one corner, a dehumidifier
in the other corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set them both at 55% and I let them
fight all day so that that room stays at
[SPEAKER_00]: 55% constantly unless we're opening and
closing the doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does happen, but with the moisture,
the plants in there, the humidifier and
[SPEAKER_00]: the dehumidifier battling, we can get
pretty close to the parameters which we
[SPEAKER_00]: expect in that room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, of course, I'm running a commercial
facility when I'm talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an air conditioner in the
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep that at the desired temperature,
about 60, 65 degrees, maybe between 60 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand a lot of you are drying in a
basement, in your extra grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your garage, in the tool shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna try to meet certain
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be ideal to get within five
degrees or 5% humidity, but I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not always possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have to be flexible and work with a
10 degree, 10% threshold here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to stay right around 55,
65, 60, maybe the ideal temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are gonna have input and
different thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to work just adjust as you
find necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just guidelines for you to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% humidity, 60% humidity, those will
both work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just gonna take a little bit
longer, a little bit shorter time to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the aroma in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the airflow in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we don't want fans blowing
directly onto the plants all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you want fans blowing on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you weirdos do, but you
don't want it blowing directly on you all
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stir that air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't dry the buds out with the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them dry slowly, but have that fan
moving the air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to rotate the plants,
so that one isn't always getting beat up
[SPEAKER_00]: by the fan at all times, feel free to
rotate those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I didn't even talk about,
how are you going to hang these plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that you've chosen a space
in which to hang your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using your grow tent,
that's ideal also.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will just cut down the
plants and then hang them right up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how are you going to hang them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to use to suspend your
plants from the ceiling, the rafters?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it gonna work?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I recommend I suggest that
happens a lot, and this is great even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing this in your grow tent,
this will work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy a thing of clothes hangers,
just the cheap plastic triangle clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: hangers with a little hook on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need anything expensive,
anything fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a broke ass, get the wire ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can even find the wire hangers
anymore, but get some coat hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you cut your plant,
pay attention to the way that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch the way the cannabis plant
grows and makes a stalk that comes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it makes a branch that comes off to
the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just above that, a branch that comes
off to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut the plant down properly,
think about come from the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, work your way down a few inches,
maybe I'm gonna say about 10, 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably about 10 or 12
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's a good section to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find one of the intersections where
the main stalk comes off and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: branch coming up this way, cut right below
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that branch as the hanger,
flip that upside down, put that on your
[SPEAKER_00]: coat hanger, and now you can hang that
hanger wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how big your buds are,
how dense and fat and beefy your branches
[SPEAKER_00]: and buds have gotten, you can probably fit
seven or several of those branches per
[SPEAKER_00]: coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste too much space and just do one
bud per hanger, do at least three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continue chopping your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the top, take that main top off,
cut it, put it on the coat hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the hanger hanging up on something so
you can access it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go down a little further,
cut in sections that you feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: with and hang those up, and hang those up
in that cool, secure place, that dark
[SPEAKER_00]: place with plenty of airflow and a
controlled temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, humidity, and airflow are
super important in the drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have enough airflow,
if you get too much humidity, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely ruin your buds by creating bud
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still potentially an issue to ruin
the inside of those buds with the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that room dialed in, get the
temperature down 60 or lower, get that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get an exhaust fan in there,
let's get some air moving, and let's try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the water out of those plants as
slowly and quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds redundant, but as a
grower, that's what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to dry as slowly and quickly
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll figure this out when you get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer the drying process takes,
the better the weed will taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the longer it takes, the longer it
fucking takes, which means there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for issues and problems to
arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you pass a certain moisture level,
don't even worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're hanging, you've got airflow,
you will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first few days is when you do really
need to pay attention and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got plenty of airflow and that your
humidity is under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we do have a drying and curing
space figured out, a place where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: hang these plants, let's review what we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a dark room that is secure with
airflow and about 50 to 60 percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: 55 to 65 percent humidity and temperature
in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, in my commercial
environment, I have a dehumidifier set at
[SPEAKER_00]: 55 percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a humidifier set at 55 percent
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an air conditioner set at 60
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the other end of the room, I've got an
air duct sucking air out so that all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: stale warm air that rose to the top with
all that humidity in there is just being
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled right from the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I don't put
that carbon filter on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a private grow, put that carbon filter
on there so everybody doesn't smell it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is the main setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the environmental controls
happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also put a hygrometer in there so
that you can look and see what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in that room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like, you could just get the
little cheap one from the local hardware
[SPEAKER_00]: store that just sits on the table and you
can look at it manually or you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulse Pro and you can look at it on your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many options for that,
but be aware of what's happening in there
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can adjust it if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, those are the first things I
would think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the dry and cure space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about some workspace?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to manage chopping this
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some space where you can cut
these plants down, carry them to another
[SPEAKER_00]: table, then do some work with them or do
you need to do it all out in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: where the plants are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know many people, so let's just
hypothetically say, I've got a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the middle of nowhere and that
greenhouse doesn't have a lot of workspace
[SPEAKER_00]: for a bunch of big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I cut them down, I've got one table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole table is covered by one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can take the plant, carry it to
that one table, break it down into smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces, then put it on my coat hangers
there and then move it to my dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll take the whole plant to my dry
and cure space, hang it all up at once and
[SPEAKER_00]: then break it into smaller pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on your environment,
your space, what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I'm trying to get at is be
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people overlook the importance of the
workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think about, I've got this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to do the work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you want to think about is
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to get supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not wait until harvest day to say,
oh yeah, I needed things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to need when it comes to
harvest time?
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing you're going to need is
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through lots of pairs of gloves
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on thicker gloves while I'm chopping
down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear thicker gloves when it comes to
shucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it actually comes to the
trimming, the manicuring, the dealing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cleafing part of the trim work,
I will go through a lot of gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should add that I may have
forgotten to talk about that just came to
[SPEAKER_00]: my head while I'm thinking about
harvesting is a few days before you
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could happen seven, five,
three days, maybe even the day before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can pull off a bunch of those big
leaves, anything with a long pedial
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking off, if you and your trim crew
can go and just pull off all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, that will save you time when it
comes to harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those leaves just dry up around the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become crusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extra shit to manage when it does
come time to manicure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can pull those off while the plant
is alive, they come off much more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go in and just pull all those leaves
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need scissors for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take off the leaves you could pop off
with your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will also speed up your drying time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a place where you were drying
too quickly, maybe don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a place where you want to
kind of speed up the dry, get those leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets more moisture out of the room
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to fix the humidity in the
drying cure space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that saves you less shit that you
have to clean up and trim in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get those leaves out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we going to need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we need a lot of gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to trim by yourself,
get your size gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got friends coming over,
be considerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe buy an extra large, a large medium
and a small box.
[SPEAKER_00]: If most of the time you won't use the
small gloves, the small rubber gloves are
[SPEAKER_00]: super tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't wear those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check around, look and see what your crew
wears and just make sure to have gloves on
[SPEAKER_00]: deck for everybody and the crew that is
super polite of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nobody's going to get their
fingers all sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also you're not going to get
their skin in your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if somebody gets an eye itch or a
booger itch, they could just take off
[SPEAKER_00]: their glove and handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to go wash their hands
just to itch their eye when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just from experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rub your eyes or do try it one time
and then you'll never do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my advice is don't rub your eyes when
you're trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not with the corner of your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not with the back of your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your whole hands are going to be sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got trichomes and chlorophyll all
over your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that finger hits your eye,
your body's going to go, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 20 seconds later, you're just going
to be in the bathroom going, oh man,
[SPEAKER_00]: it burns, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just going to be rubbing your
eye and your hands are sticky because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been trimming and your eye is
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when you move your hand away from
your eye, your fucking eyelashes are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to stick to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't do it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice Don't touch your eyes
when you're trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your eye or nose itches, take off the
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of your eye, your nose,
do whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then apply a fresh glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a cheap ass and keep reusing
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on a new glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things you might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have at least one pair of scissors on deck
for every person that you plan to trim
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs at least one pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after a few minutes of trimming,
those scissors are going to get sticky as
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times what we'll do, we'll just
have a bucket of dirty scissors,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bucket of clean scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When yours get dirty, throw them into that
dirty pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a clean pair of scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody in your crew will take it upon
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a person in this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody will say, I'm sick of looking at
the dirty scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grab the dirty scissors and they
will start cleaning all of those scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is customary is they take all that
scissor hash that comes off the scissors
[SPEAKER_00]: and they put it in the middle of the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is now smoke for the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody in the room wants to get
stoned, smoke that scissor hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Mike's favorite shit to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mike really loves scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're trimming, throw those dirty
scissors into a little pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then somebody in the crew and maybe you
who knows, there's always somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one person with OCD will grab all
those scissors, clean them up,
[SPEAKER_00]: take all that resin off there,
roll it up into a ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll even be polite enough to
pack it into a bowl and get that going
[SPEAKER_00]: around for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rotate scissors out, have enough
scissors for everybody, and then have
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a backup pair for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I know that adds up quite quickly,
but then also have something on deck to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean those other scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a small razor blade just to
scrape all the shit off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I soak them in rubbing alcohol
like 91% iso.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some of the dark crystal glass
cleaner, that also works very well to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a little bit of coconut oil will get
that extra residue off of your skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: off your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got some up here on your arms or
whatever, a little bit of coconut oil will
[SPEAKER_00]: help that rub off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have gloves, have scissors for
everybody, have a way to clean those
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors, have a backup pair of scissors
for everybody if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, if you can get them,
have the little springs for your scissors,
[SPEAKER_00]: have backups of those because you have no
idea until you get down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea how many pairs of those
scissors the spring is going to fly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spring is going to get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get the scissors that come with
the backup spring, I recommend purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you will need is some sort
of trash receptacle, a trash bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: a trash can, something to put leaves and
trim and scissors and sticks and waste
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is,
where are all of your sticks and stems and
[SPEAKER_00]: empty pots and all that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that going to go when you're
done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to recycle, upcycle your
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing a living soil where you can
just keep going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do, what else is the other option?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you did some hydroton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you did rock wool cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do with your waste?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where your grow is taking
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a legal state?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a prohibition state?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a legal state, it's much
easier to dispose of your waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if somebody drives by and sees a
bunch of five gallon pots outside and your
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of Fox Farms leftover soil and a bunch
of sticks, they know you just harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know there's a crop in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's law enforcement, they want to
check on your crop and see how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's thieves, they want to come get
your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the homies, they want to come
smoke your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be discreet with your trash, whether it's
a legal or illegal place.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most locations, once your trash goes to
your curb, that is now fair game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Law enforcement does not need any sort of
warrant to go through your trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that when you're putting your
trash at the curb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, just maybe, you need to find a
safer, more discreet place to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: your trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, maybe, you're living in a rural
area and you could just throw it all in
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be ideal, but I do understand
that's not an option for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you guys all to be successful and I
want you all to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that trash can be used as evidence just
as much as your harvested product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I mentioned is some
hangers or some wire of some sort and some
[SPEAKER_00]: little screw hooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to hang these plants when we cut
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I talked about was the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to hang these?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use your grow tent, it's already
got those bars in the ceiling that are
[SPEAKER_00]: holding it up and the bars that come to
hold up the carbon filter and the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just hang the coat hangers from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that, what you're gonna
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I can recommend is get those eye
hooks that screw into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, don't do this in like the
living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this in the work shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this somewhere like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use little eye hooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw them into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then walk across the room and at the same
height put another eye hook in the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then use a piece of you can use a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen fishing line used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen twine used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it is very strong because you're
gonna hang more than you anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just run some sort of a line from one
end of the room and string up as many
[SPEAKER_00]: lines as you need and hang those plants on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's start thinking about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you're cutting down plants and then
you go, oh shit, where am I gonna hang
[SPEAKER_00]: these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a lot of stoners do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a lot of growers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourself up for success and be
ready for this upcoming harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've covered the main supplies that we
need for a successful harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about a couple of small details
that will make this harvest better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comfortable chairs are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be at this for several
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many plants you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how well you did,
but hopefully you're gonna be trimming for
[SPEAKER_00]: several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard somebody today say that they will
be trimming until Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna chop down around Halloween
and they will be trimming until Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how much ganja that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how many hours of sitting in a
chair with scissors in your hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking down at some buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine how much time that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about a comfortable chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you consider a comfy
chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting up in a higher bar stool type
chair right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me sit with a straighter back and
kind of gives me forced better posture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a good chair for me to trim
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course then I'm gonna get tired and
want to lean back, but consider what you
[SPEAKER_00]: like as a comfortable chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be considerate to your trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you invite people over, don't give them
a five gallon bucket to sit on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect them to trim your weed while
they sit on a crate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a comfortable chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a pillow to put on that chair if
they need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the people you've got coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you young guys can trim all
fucking night with no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: My back gets sore right about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neck will get sore right about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to think about how to keep that
neck and back in shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend taking a lot of breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like laziness,
but you got to get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any other job you're required to take a
break every two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a break for every two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a repetitive stress injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you set a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on a podcast or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of every podcast make sure you
and the work crew stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stretch your wrists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a couple of different wrist stretches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wiggle your arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your hands above your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some some wiggles going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold your hands low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some wiggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some blood flow into places the blood
hasn't been in a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look at a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see what outside looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been inside, go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've been outside, go inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a different view for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go outside with all your friends and
smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get away from the trim table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the crew out there and smoke a joint
for 10 minutes and don't talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't talk about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will buy you a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds silly, but when you're
going to be trimming for up until
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas, good scheduled breaks and a
good disciplined break in a routine will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure your trim crew is
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys take good breaks and
stay motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are the guy, the gal, the person in
charge of hiring a trim crew, it is also
[SPEAKER_00]: good customs to provide drinks and snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also got to pay the trim crew some
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're friends, they'll come do it for
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to compensate them,
you can give them weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give them money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give them edibles, but definitely
feed them while they are there working for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, a lot of us are vegan,
vegetarian, have some dietary
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe ask people, hey, I'm trying to buy
some snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite munchie food for
while you're trimming?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can get people some good
snacks, some good drinks, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: have good water around, take care of your
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can we talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcasts and or music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some sort of entertainment going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just you trimming by yourself,
put on whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fucking judge on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decide for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to what you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got a crew, like if Mike was
here, I wouldn't play fish all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may play some fish, but if Mike's here
trimming, he's not going to listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: seven hours of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Mike is here, we're not going to listen
to Legion of Skanks podcast back to back
[SPEAKER_00]: like I would if I was by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be considerate of your trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I brought Mike over and we trimmed for
six hours and I played fish and sublime
[SPEAKER_00]: all day, he will not come back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have to come trim for you, so make sure
you keep them happy, fed and comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say the phrase trim jail
and maybe I'm a stickler, but that bothers
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people in jail that are dealing
with some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trimming, you're not in jail,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sitting at the table with your
friends, listening to sublime,
[SPEAKER_00]: eating fucking snacks, possibly on
Discord, chatting it up with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really like it when you guys
call it trim jail because there are people
[SPEAKER_00]: in jail that don't get to do shit all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dealing with some shit and we're
sitting at the table listening to sublime,
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking kombucha and expensive bottled
water and a nice air conditioned
[SPEAKER_00]: environment with all of our friends and
nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trim jail does sound kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that wraps up my outdoor harvest
preparations for this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped set you up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a great amazing outdoor
harvest this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it is everything that you asked
for, everything that you hoped for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you supply yourself as long as you
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I hope you made a bunch of notes
and you know exactly what to improve next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
